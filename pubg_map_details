Then pick off the survivors from the boxing ring. Be weary of everyone that drops with you though, because it is relatively easy to move around El Pozo while staying in cover and remaining unseen. \nThere are more than enough vehicle spawns here to almost guarantee you one if needed, and while its location isn’t the most central, it’s quite rare that the circle will push you to leave early, unlike some of the locations on the very outskirts of the map."

However, now more people know how great Water Treatment can be, so it’s also quite a popular drop. \nOn a good day this can kit out a full squad of four, but you will have to take down whoever lands with you with the limited loot you land on. There really isn’t that much solid cover in Water Treatment, and even the areas that you can hide behind allow for easy flanks. Combine that with a lot of the loot locations leaving you very exposed and you're often stuck with what you land on until you take out the competition. \nThe main two buildings are solid shouts, but the real loot can be found around the pipes in the middle. You will be exposed, but with tons of individual loot spawns in that area it should be easy to drop onto a solid weapon."

This of course brings a lot of players to the area, but the sheer size of Los Leones offers up a lot of cover and space to loot in, which means if you play smart you can avoid early-game fights all together. \nIf you don’t fancy heading right into the city, there is a line of warehouse buildings going North to South on the entire West side of the city. Land here and make your way through all the big buildings and you should come out with solid loot, in a short amount of time and with little resistance. \nVehicles are also not a concern with more spawns than you could ever make use of, and there is a ton of ways to get out of the city if one road is locked down. In fact the only major downside, outside of the popularity, is that some of the buildings, or building sites, offer little loot and take ages to explore. Stick to the completed buildings and you should be fine."

But drop there once and you'll understand that the loot available here is unlike any other on the map. \nHead towards the villa towards the North of Hacienda and you will be greeted with more loot than any one person can carry. It'll easily kit out a squad of four, nine times out of 10, and chances are you'll walk out with at least a couple of silenced weapons and as many level two helmets and vests and you could need. \nThis kind of loot of course brings with it a lot of foes, who you will have to defeat to walk out with the riches Hacienda has to offer, and vehicles are not guaranteed. But it is very central, and often in the first circle, so you’ll have time to win some fights and loot everything there is."

This tiny town is located right in the middle of the map, meaning it is reachable from almost every plane path, and has basically become Miramar’s version of School. You drop here, grab a gun and go fight straight away. \nThe boxing ring and casino are the two major attractions, and offer solid loot, but that really doesn’t matter 90% of the time, because Pecado is always a case of grab what you can when you land and make the best of it. The other buildings on the West side can be solid options if you want to survive, but that really isn’t buying into the fun of Pecado. \nIf, by some miracle, yo do make it out of Pecado alive and with solid loot, which you will have because you'll be able to loot about 10 different bodies once the dust settles, you should be in a good spot.

Sitting on the South coast it’s the most almost as far West as you can go. There are a few vehicle spawns, especially around the bridge, but sometimes you might not get a vehicles and that is basically game over. \nIf you get a plane path that allows it then Valle del Mar can be a good shout. It has solid loot, is rarely a busy location and sits on the water, meaning you can make rotations via the waves if you want to. But you have to be ready to move early if the circle is not kind. \nWhile it’s much less of a viable strategy than on Erangle, you an bridge camp here to get a few easy kills. It of course depends on the plane route, but with southern planes you can certainly rack up a couple of kills this way."

However, this means that its rare multiple people drop here, unless it’s close to the plane, so it can be a safe drop for those not looking to fight. If it’s not directly under the plane, then this can easily be a game winning drop. \nLoot is average at best, but if you are alone you should come out with a decent load out, especially if you mop up all the smaller buildings on the outskirts. While it is tempting to go for the high ground that has a couple of big sheds, the loot up there is actually limited, so starting on the lower side of town is usually the better option. \nThere’s a few vehicle spawns and a load of smaller compounds in the surrounding area, so even if the town itself is disappointing, you have a lot of other options, which makes this quite the versatile drop."

However, when playing alone this is a great drop. Not that many people either know about it, or value it enough to go there, which means most of the time you have this entire cave system just south of Los Leones to yourself and it usually has some pretty good loot. \n\nIt can take a while to get your bearings when in there, and for the first few times you will miss some of the loot spawns, but after a few visits you will know where to look.

These four-wheeled behemoths are hard to miss, which is handy really because shooting them means they drop loot. \nDestroying them will allow you to hoover up a huge pile of loot, including named weapon variants that offer preset attachments and bonuses to things like handling or magazine capacity. It's worth remembering, though, that firing on these vehicles is a risk; while they can't return fire, gunfire will give away your position to nearby players.\nThere are four trucks at the start of the map, but up to eight can spawn per match as they're destroyed.

Even if you think it's far enough away from the plane path that no one will go there, there’s always a very high chance of someone joining you. \nAs well as being a popular location, there is also a lack of vehicle spawns. Now that’s not often a massive issue because walking anywhere in Sanhok is pretty easy early on, but is something to keep in mind.

Multiple people can find their way out of Boot Camp and usually with some great gear. It has perhaps the best loot on the entirety of Sanhok and more than enough to kit out multiple people.

Most of the boxes and crates have a potential loot spawn on top of them, so be sure to climb up on top of the high ground areas to locate the best weapons. \nThe big downside here is that anyone passing by will be able to spot you and you will have limited cover and be on the low ground.

In our minds this is really a top tier drop, sure the loot might not be as reliable as say Boot Camp, but you'd have to be super unlucky to not come out with at least an AR and some acceptable backup."

Pre-aim corners as you move around and you shouldn’t run into too many problems, as long as you take your time and don’t run willy nilly across the open areas."

    "description": "One of the most iconic locations on the map, the Cosmodrome is as you’d expect; an old abandoned spaceport. Around the rocket launch site has some very wide open areas, but if you stick to some of the single storey buildings away from the rocket site, you’ll find that almost all of them have underground areas with plenty of loot.\nYou’re going to want to treat the Cosmodrome in a similar way to the Winery; treat each corner as if someone is waiting around it, and proceed cautiously. You can get a serious amount of loot here, but the surrounding areas can be a pain to run through when the blue is advancing so make sure you leave with plenty of time to spare."

    "description": "This one isn’t advised if your goal is to camp until the end of the game, but Castle is absolutely the best drop if you want to engage with other players and practice your skills in combat scenarios. It’s the most popular place on the map and also the coolest - it’s even got a river that doubles as a moat!\nIf you manage to land at Castle and grab a decent weapon from the start, you want to be checking every single corner. The layout means there’s plenty of corners for other players to be sat behind, but if you are one of the few survivors here and you have a gun with a long range scope, head up to the highest walkway for a solid lookout spot. Like the Cosmodrome though, you’re going to want to vamoose with plenty of time to spare because there’s nothing worse than swimming across the moat with the blue chomping at your heels."

    "description": "If you’re playing solos, landing at the Lumber Yard is a good option for some isolation. There’s not a lot to say about this place; it has a few large open sheds with loot littering the floor, and you won’t find many other people landing here with you. If you don’t have enough stuff from the main Lumber Yard, there are multiple clusters of buildings all around, so you should have no problem getting over to them in peace.\nOur only word of warning is if you have a very western safe zone. The closest path into the circle will be across one of the only bridges that leads to the Castle, so there’s a good chance you’ll be a sitting duck as you either run across the bridge or swim through the water. Keep an eye on the timer and as always, move early if you think you could get held at a choke point."

    "description": "In the south-east corner of the map, you’ll find the small town of Cantra. It’s a quaint village, but in our experience, it tends to have some of the best loot compared to the other smaller towns like Vihar or Krichas. We’d recommend landing at the church in the corner first, then after that, check out some of the smaller buildings.\nOnce you’re done in the main town, the Hot Springs are also right around the corner if you have time before the blue catches you. Keep an eye on the incoming zone though, because you’re so far away from the centre of the map, you’ll have some light jogging to do."

    "description": "Another good location for solos and duos, the Villa is self-explanatory. There’s a big building - the villa - and a few smaller sheds around the courtyard. You’ll find numerous weapons and attachments in the main building, and there’s also a Dacia spawn point in one of the garages.\nThe main selling point for the Villa is how centrally located it is. You’ll almost always be safe for at least the first two zones, then when you eventually do have to move, there are a lot of buildings and house clusters to dart between if someone has already nicked the car."
