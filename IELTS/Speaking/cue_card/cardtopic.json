    "Question": "Describe a relative/friend/family member who you think is similar to you.",
    "Question__1": "1. I do not know how it is possible but my friend Jim is almost similar to me. He is a college student here in New York and we both are in the same college. In fact, the teachers are often confused from a distance to identify whether I am Jim or not. We both have similar height,s weights and body complexion. Coincidentally, our faces also appear similar to an extent. This is really a wonder for me and everyone else. When we met first in the college two years ago, both of us were surprised seeing us. He loves reading books like me and we have the same taste in music as well.\n\n2. My cousin Lita is similar to me. She is similar in the sense that we both share the same mental attitude. Both of us are perfectionists. Lita is a university student and senior to me by two and a half years. Other relatives wonder about the picky nature of us. In fact, they are too much irritated on the issue that Lita and I are too much compulsive. She dislikes the traditional food of Indonesia as do I. Attention to every detail about everything is our special feature.\n\n3. Robert is my maternal uncle and I have some striking similarities with him. He works for a multinational corporation in Thailand and comes to visit us once or twice to Australia, where I live in. Some of our relatives and friends are on the view that there are too many similarities between us in terms of nature and reactions to different events. He loves music and formed a band in his youth as I am doing exactly the same thing. In fact, they term me as the reflection of his past days. I am fond of adventure as he is.\n\n4. My father is my icon and my family members and relatives say that I have become more like him. My father is a government employee here in Sri Lanka and a perfect gentleman in nature. My other siblings are just opposite to him while I am the perfect copy of my dad. My relatives said that they never saw him getting angry and they also see the feature in me. I think I have some other similarities with my dad. He loves to read books and I am a book lover too. Dad is also fond of sweetmeats and seems like I have inherited this as well!\n\n5. My mom is my best friend and I have many similarities with her. She is a perfect housewife here in India. She is an example of how a woman can be perseverant in the present days. She is highly tolerant and cares for everyone in the family. Though I did not have a similar physique; I have similarity with her in terms of characteristics. I love to entertain guests and never get rude with the other family members like my mom. We also have similarities in nature – both of us love to help people."

    "Question": "Describe your favourite way to relax.",
    "Question__1": "1. The way people relax or enjoy their free time varies from person to person. I love to listen to music when I want to relax. Usually, I listen to music at night. In fact, I cannot manage time to enjoy my leisure or relax time except at night. Playing the role of a sales executive is tough indeed. So, I spend a couple of hours after the evening on my own. I like to listen to relaxing music. It helps me feel refreshed. All my stresses are gone with the tones of musical instruments. And this is also good for my mental health.\n \n2. Participation in sports is a good way to feel relaxed. So, I often take part in different outdoor sports. I usually take part in sports in the evening hours. I play different types of sports like football, cricket among others. This is really effective for me. I do not feel any stress after taking part in sports. This is my favourite way to relax as they have some other benefits as well. They also help me remain fit. \n \n3. I love to paint and this is the best way for me to get relaxed. Whenever I need to have some rest, I move to the rooftop of my apartment located here in Tokyo, Japan. This is a great way for me. Whenever I paint, all the troubles vanish from my mind. Besides, it also helps get some new ideas. This is my preferred way because it helps me to think about nature and increases the concentration power. And I have gathered a good number of paintings so far which are really adorable.\n \n4. Reading books is the best way for many people for relaxation. And I am not an exception. I love to read books to feel comfortable. Usually, I read books before sleeping at night. It helps me spend times with the stories and events inside the books. It helps me travel through the minds of the authors. So, when I read books, I forget all my occupational agonies. I like reading books the most for relaxation because I can do it silently. Nobody feels disturbed when I read books. \n \n5. Watching movies as a way of relaxation may sound weird to many but this is my favourite way of relaxation. I watch the movies in the afternoon and thrice in a week. Whenever I feel stressed or get involved in any mental disarray, I watch movies. By this way, I feel relaxed from the worries. This is an exceptional way and just the opposite of the conventional ways of relaxation. But it is appropriate for me as I find pleasure in getting lost in a movie plot. Actually, there are no special reasons for it."

    "Question": "Describe a city or a town where you live or lived.",
    "Question__1": "1. Living in Stuttgart was fun. I passed three years there. The city is located in Germany and I am familiar with most of the places in this city. The city has some important landmarks including Apollo Theatre, Fernsehturm Stuttgart a 216.61-meters telecommunications tower, Tagblatt-Turm a 61-m 16-story skyscraper, The Romeo and Juliet Apartments and so on. This is a special city to me because it has a special charm, particularly, I love the nightlife. Exploring the city at night is really special.\n\n2. At present, I am a permanent resident in Tianjin, China. I came here to study around a decade ago and fell in love with the city. I am familiar with the western part of the city where I live with my family. The city has some important landmarks and they include - Eye of Tianjin-a 120 meters tall Ferris wheel built on a bridge, Tianhou Palace that was built during the Yuan Dynasty period, Quanyechang Bazaar where live models are available with clothes on them, Marco Polo Square among others. The city is special to me for its diversified culture.\n\n3. I could not believe that Samara in Russia had such an enriched history. I lived there for four years for my higher studies. As I had to remain busy with my studies, I am only familiar with the top attractions of the city. It owns the Ascension Cathedral in the centre of the city, Iver Monastery on the Volga steep, the monument to IL-2, Cosmic Samara Museum, and Stalin’s Bunker. They are great places indeed to explore. I was in love with these famous places which appeared very special to me for their wonderful histories.\n\n4. I am very proud of being an Indian. I live in New Delhi and know almost all the parts of this city. There are a good number of places in the city and each of them has a special attraction. The India Gate is in the heart of the city and the Qutub Minar, the Red Fort, Chandni Chowk, Rang Mahal, Rajpath etc. are the key landmarks here. To me, the city is special because of its diversity. A wide number of people of different casts creed and colour live here in harmony. Besides, the visiting places are highly attractive and their histories amaze me.\n\n5. Living in Tokyo has some great advantages and I am happy to be a Japanese national indeed. This is the capital and the busiest city in Japan and I am familiar with the entire city. A good number of landmarks are available here and the most popular landmarks are – The Imperial Palace, Ginza District- the best place for shopping, Asakusa, and the Sensō-ji Temple, National Museum of Nature and Science, Ueno Park and the Zoo.

    "Question": "Describe an important technological advancement in your country.",
    "Question__1": "1. Well, this is a great topic to discuss. The widespread use of online newspapers is a great movement for my country, Vietnam. Earlier, it was not so much prevalent. People used to read printed newspapers. And with the of time, people have become attracted to online newspapers gradually. The transition took around five to seven years. As a result, a good number of online news portals have appeared while the printed versions have their online presence. People can now have up-to-the-minute news and information at their home.\n\n2. The acceptance of mobile phone apps is a great technological advancement for the people of Sri Lanka. Though it began globally a long ago, the technology hit the country later. And the change took around five years to happen. In fact, the use of mobile phone apps has brought a revolution in the country. They use the apps for different purposes. Most of the people use different gaming and entertaining apps and others to pass their leisure hours. They also use navigation apps to move across the country too.\n\n3. In most places in Singapore, people rely on washing machines. In fact, the practice of using machines for cleaning purposes has been going on for long. It took over 15 years to grab the technology completely to clean clothes using a machine. This has had a great impact on the people as many of them are highly busy with their respective tasks. So, they have less time to complete the cleaning process. As a result, they can apply the spare time for other productive purposes.\n\n4. I did not have an idea that the smart television would be so much popular here in India. Earlier, people used to enjoy shows on CRT TV. And now, people are fond of smart television sets for their special benefits. The change in television technology is relatively new – it happened during the last couple of years. With improved technology, people now can enjoy different types of contents on television. They can browse the internet as well on the large screen which is a great way to enjoy TV shows and events.\n\n5. At present, music is greatly enjoyed by people and with the invention of the digital piano, composing music has become easier than ever before. The technology appeared in the 1980s in the USA and since then, there had been tremendous changes in the music industry. People now love listening to music composed on a digital piano. Moreover, the instrument has become popular and a symbol of status for many citizens. Thereby, people are fond of digital pianos and even version for the children of the instrument is available. Now, this is considered as a great technological device for music."

    "Question": "Describe an activity you recently took part in.",
    "Question__1": "1. I am glad to have this topic in my share. Last month, I took part in a painting exhibition at my college in Singapore. I took part in it because I wanted to get some ideas about painting competition and assess my skill in painting. It was organized in an efficient manner. The authority had great arrangements for the competition. We had to bring papers and other tools for painting. I felt glad and had won a prize too which was inspiring for me indeed.\n\n2. Recently, I took part in a cycling competition in Adelaide. It was a nice event for me. I wanted to get some refreshments and get to know other cyclists in our area. The event was well organized and I thank the authority for such a nice refreshing event in the city. I was highly glad to be part of this competition. In fact, I did not have the chances to spend some refreshing moments lately and this bicycling event made me feel great.\n\n3. Taking part in an interview is hard indeed if you do not have necessary preparations. I had to participate in an interview as it was held suddenly. And so, I did not have the proper preparation for that. But it was well organized. The authority was cordial to me and did not ask irrelevant questions. So, I was able to make a deal with them. Initially, I was a bit upset about the interview but later, all the worries were gone.\n\n4. Last month, I took part in a cultural event in my son’s school. It was not mandatory for all the guardians but I took part in it as I like the idea of the event. It was organized in the school premise and a few indoor games were arranged for the guardians. I was glad to be there and the event took back me to my teen days. I used to take part in indoor activities like passing pillows, playing chess, singing, and others. It was a memorable day for me and my son indeed.  \n\n5. Participating in physical activities is my hobby but I am unable to participate all the times. So, I did not miss the one that was arranged by my gym. I took part in the activity to refresh my former skills. I took part in physical training and freehand exercises. I felt glad. But it was hard for me to start the activities at the beginning as I was abstaining from such activities for a long. But finally, I enjoyed the event and also got an award for my performance."

    "Question": "Describe one of the most popular TV shows in your country.",
    "Question__1": "1. Among the television shows that I watch, I love The Vietnam War the most. This is a 10-part documentary and is broadcasted in Vietnam. This is a series and the overall length is roughly 18 hours. The documentary is about the Vietnam War that shows some archival footages of the war. I like it because it created a sense of thrill among the viewers and it was one of the most opposed topics in the country. However, it gained popularity for its special appeal to many people who wanted to know about the War events.\n\n2. I am fond of sport-adventure television shows and Sasuke is one of my favourite ones. The show is about completing an obstacle course. There are four stages and the contestants are to cross the barriers in order to reach the prize. I like the programme because of its innovative obstacles. Often I laugh at the contestants when they fail to cross the barriers for some silly reasons. The show is popular in Japan because people want to get entertainment through TV shows.\n \n3. Honestly speaking, Big Boss is an extraordinary show that draws my attention, like thousand other audiences, in India. The programme shows how the contestants win cash prizes and try not to get eliminated. They need votes from the audience to remain on the track. I love this particular show as it demonstrates how the participants survive through the series in the locked state. The show is also popular in India because of its thrill and audiences are highly interested to know about the final result after the climax.\n\n4. Presently, learning a language has become easier and I love to watch a German show which many people use to learn the language. In fact, Tatort is one of the highly interesting shows that are about crimes. This suspenseful show had been running for long. I love the show because of its nature – it holds the attention through a series of events that occurred in the socio-political scenarios. The show is also popular among the Germans as each of the episodes has a different storyline and particularly different accents. \n\n5. Among various shows in China, I am most fond of ‘Fighter of the Destiny'. This production is adapted from a novel of the same name. The programme is about a mystical meteor crashing on the planet. And the storyline revolves around a wide number of events. The show is about love, illness, legacy and more. I am in love with the show for its dramatic nature. The show is also popular among the Chinese people because some of the episodes of the show reflect some of the special events that take place in almost everyone’s life in China."

    "Question": "Describe your favourite sport.",
    "Question__1": "1. Participation in basketball is my favourite form of sport. I frequently take part in the sport at my college in Adelaide. Playing the game requires a ball, several players (5 in a team) and two sets of baskets. Free movement is a must in the game. I love basketball as it is helpful for having a fit body. It also needs to run across the court and thus the players get benefits of running. Moreover, it also teaches teamwork and other issues which are applicable in real-life as well.\n\n2. Field hockey appears an interesting sport to me. This is a special type of competition and not everyone is able to play it. I play it twice in a week in my college playground. In fact, it requires lots of preparations and fitness. The sport needs hockey and a ball. The players try to score goals by pushing the ball on the opponent’s net. This is my favourite sport because it gives me immense pleasure. Moreover, it also helps me keep fit and relaxed. I do not need to have some extra exercises as I regularly;y play this sport.\n\n3. At present, skateboarding is not considered as a popular form of sport but I love skateboarding. I usually take part in the sport almost every day in the week. Actually, I have my own skateboard and I use it whenever I need it. Riding a skateboard needs some special set of balancing skills. Losing balance will result in the downfall of the rider. I love skateboarding because it helps me to move to places easily and avoid traffic congestions. I do not need to ride on external transports here in New York as I am a skateboarder.\n\n4. From my childhood, I have a dream to be a boxer. Unluckily, I failed to make the dream come true but still, boxing is my favourite sport. I take part in the sport occasionally. Boxing needs regular practice or there are chances to get hurt. This is my favourite sport because it helps me learn to protect myself. In fact, it has some real-life applications. You can save yourself from untoward events. So, I like it.\n\n5. Undoubtedly badminton is a great form of sport. I play it once a week. Playing badminton requires badminton racquets and shuttles. It is played in singles or doubles. When played double, two teams compete with each other to defeat by making higher scores. This is my favourite sport as it helps to build muscles. Besides, it is an exciting game as well both for the audience and the players."

    "Question": "Describe a photograph you have taken yourself which you particularly like.",
    "Question__1": "1. I took the best picture of my life when I was a teen and the picture shows my parents are walking down on a road hand in hand. It was in the evening when I clicked the picture. I took it out of curiosity and my parents even did not know that they were being captured. I like this photograph because it was my best shot. The sun was setting in the background while a man and a woman was walking down the streets. It looks wonderful indeed.\n\n2. My baby boy was portrayed in the picture while he was swimming in a pool. I took the picture in the afternoon. In fact, my boy went for a swim and I captured him on the camera. It was nearly the evening when I took the picture. I took it for no particular reason. I had my camera in my hand and just clicked it. But now I am in love with the photograph because it is a good one that I have ever captured. I am not a professional photographer but it appears that the photograph is a masterpiece.\n\n3. A couple of boys were jumping into a pond in the picture that I would like to talk about. Actually, a group of boys went swimming in the local pond in the late morning and I took the picture right then with my cell phone. I took the shot to test my phone’s camera as I bought that a few days ago. And it was a nice shot indeed. The photo colour and camera performance were much better than expected. And overall, it was a symbol of my photographic sense. So, I like it more than other photographs I have taken so far.\n\n4. The setting sun on a beach is a wonderful view and I captured such a moment using my digital camera. I took the photo when I went to Bali in Indonesia last month. I wanted to capture the moment and so I clicked the photo. The situation was so adorable that I could not resist my intention to capture the sun in photo form. I think the location was perfect for a photo shoot and I did the right thing at the right time. So, I like the photo.\n\n5. This is hard indeed to take a selfie and take a bath at the same time. But I did so despite the setbacks. I took the photo last summer while bathing in a swimming pool here in Australia. It was almost evening when I took the photo. And I took it to make fun only. The photo contains all the favourite people of mine and we were making fun in the pool. And honestly speaking, it was a perfect photo in terms of composition, background selection, and every other thing. So, I like it very much."

    "Question": "Describe a famous building/landmark in your hometown.",
    "Question__1": "1. India is the country of numerous landmarks and among those, I like the Qutub Minar the most. It has a different appeal to me. The 73-meter structure was built between 1192 – 1220 by Qutub Ud-Din-Aibak. This is a straight tall tower and has been constructed in several phases at different times. The Minar is an important landmark for Delhi because fewer historic structures like this are available in the country. It looks special and its design is highly attractive as well.\n\n2. The Temple of Zeus is located in Olympia. This is one of the Greek temples and was dedicated to Zeus. The temple was built in 470 BC (not exact construction date is available). The temple is different from the other ordinary temples in the country. It rests on a platform with three unequal steps. The exterior and interior have a grandeur look. This is an important landmark because it represents respects to Zeus. It was built for religious purposes as well.\n\n3. England is the land of natural beauties and a good number of landmarks are available here. The Shard is one of them. In fact, this is a 95-storey skyscraper. And interestingly, this is made of glass. The building was inaugurated in 2012. It looks like a long tower made of glass and when the sun rays reflect, it looks glittering. This is an important landmark in England because it accommodates some of the important offices, restaurants and residences. The open-air observation deck is a great place to enjoy as well. \n\n4. If you ask me for a popular landmark in Beijing, I will surely recommend the Forbidden City.  This is located in central part of Beijing and now is used as the Palace Museum. The complex is aged for over 500 years and has served diversified purposes in the country. This is a complex that consists of over 950 buildings. It also covers over 180 acres of lands as well. This is a landmark for its extraordinary construction styles and vastness. It also got international recognition as well.\n\n5. Among a notable number of landmarks, the Kuala Lumpur Tower appears the most beautiful one to me. This is basically a communication tower and was completed in 1995. The height of the tower is 421 meters. The tower stands free from the ground. It looks aristocratic from a distance and indeed the symbol of modern beauty. This is an important building because it helps to see the city in a panoramic view. The restaurant provides the most delicious food and overall this is a famous tourist spot."

    "Question": "Describe one of your favourite newspapers/ magazines.",
    "Question__1": "1. Among a notable number of magazines, I am in love with the LMD (Lanka Monthly Digest). This is one of the most popular business magazines in Sri Lanka. Each of the copy costs around RS 100. I read the magazine every month after it is published. I like the magazine because it contains all the necessary business information I need to know to run my business and get an insight into the business world. Besides, the LMD has some interesting stories on it.\n\n2. Reading newspaper is my daily habit and I prefer the Tien Phong to go through each of the mornings. Each of the copies cost a little and I have subscribed it for a year. The newspaper is delivered to my home every morning. I love to read the newspaper as it contains all the necessary news and information about home and abroad. Besides, the cover and writing style is also adorable. This is one of the widely circulated newspapers in the country as well.\n\n3. While talking about newspapers in Denver, I certainly will describe the Denver Post. This is an outstanding newspaper. The price is reasonable for each copy. I get a copy with a fraction of a dollar. I read the newspaper daily. And I like it so much because of the investigative and in-depth reports. The newspaper publishes news and events of varied interests. The credibility of this particular newspaper is more than the other local and regional newspapers available here.\n\n4. I think everyone will agree with me that MEN’S NON-NO is the best magazines for men in Japan. This is a fashion magazine and published in a month. The price for each copy is around ¥760. I read the magazine slowly. In fact, I do not want the entire magazine to be finished in a moment and then I have to wait for a month to get a new edition. I like the magazine because it comes with the best news and information about men's fashion. It contains tips and tricks for health and beauty that the men most of the time ignore.\n\n5. People who love food like me cannot avoid their bondage with ‘Delicious’. This is a food magazine in Australia and each copy costs around AUD 65. I read the magazine almost every week. And I like the magazine because it provides some special recipes. Besides, it also describes various local and international food preparation and sometimes, stories about food are also available. In a word, it has grabbed my attention and has become a constant companion for me."

    "Question": "Describe an item of clothing you purchased that you didn’t like.",
    "Question__1": "1. From now on, I will consider shopping from street markets as a crime for me. I bought a T-shirt last month and did not like it finally after returning home. I bought the shirt from Chinatown here in Thailand. It was dark blue with the traditional style. But later I disliked it because there were some holes in the back part of the shirt that I did not notice or I was not allowed to notice while purchasing. Due to the holes, I would be unable to wear it. And so, I did not like the clothing.\n\n2. Although I liked the red-coloured skirt, I dislike it later because the colour appeared a bit fade. I bought the skirt from a brand shop in New Delhi. It was pa lain red with some designs on the lower parts. But I did not like the skirt as it came with a lace. In fact, I did not notice the lace on the waist while purchasing it. And when I noticed that, I felt a sense of irritation. Usually, I use skirts with bright colours and initially preferred the red – and when found the colour a bit fade, I did not like it anymore.\n\n3. Riding bikes need a suitable jacket but the one that I bought last month is no longer the one I like! I bought the jacket from a superstore in central Indonesia. It was black in colour with a nice collar. It came with buttons all over it. But I did not like it afterwards because the buttons were distorted after I used it a few times. Even, one of the collar buttons was uprooted. Later, when I took it back to the shop, they refused to replace it. Considering all the grounds, and irritation grew on me for the jacket.\n\n4. White is my favourite colour and I bought a white shirt last month. I bought it from a street vendor here in Sri Lanka. The shirt came with a nice collar and everything was fine. But I was shocked after it was washed. The fabric started shrinking. Actually, after a single wash with clean water, the shirt became shorter! I could not wear them anymore. It happened due to the fabric that was the finest in quality. Hereby, I could not like the shirt at all.\n\n5. Last winter, I bought an overcoat for me. I purchased that from a shopping mall here in Moscow. It was grey in colour and had a belt to fasten around the waist. Everything was right but I missed one point while buying. It came with had no buttons. So, fastening the belts was a bit troublesome for me. I also could not like it because it was too heavy to use. The colour also faded more than it was in the beginning. All the matters generated a sense of dislike for the overcoat on me."

    "Question": "Describe a movie you would like to watch again.",
    "Question__1": "1. I watched 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark' a couple of years ago and the movie was about recovering some historically important archaeological artefacts from a distant place. I watched the movie at my cousin’s home here in Thailand. And two of my cousins were present with me then. I want to watch the movie again because it was highly interesting. And the performance of the artists was exceedingly attractive that I cannot forget their expressions.\n\n2. The experience was admirable when I first saw the movie – 'For a Few Dollars More'. It was a western movie dealing with some of the contemporary issues at the time of filming it. I watched the movie at my university dormitory in Paris. Some of my friends were with me at that time. I want to watch the movie again because of the action scenes, especially the gunfights. Actually, the time that is reflected in the movie was filled with excitements and killing people was a minor issue while some people went against the trend.\n\n3. 'The Gods Must Be Crazy' was an excellent movie that I want to watch again. A couple of stories are blended together in this movie and is led by an indigenous man who is surprised by the modern inventions. Tom arrived at my home and we watched the movie together here in Vietnam. I want to watch the movie again because it was a highly entertaining one. The hilarious events and the movie plot were thrilling indeed.\n\n4. The memories are vivid in my mind when I watched 'The Godfather'. This is a drama movie and was about the inner events of a mafia family – how the family chief experienced his ups and downs, and many more events that make him the don and the consequences of plots against him and his family. I watched the movie with my wife here in Brussels. And I want to watch it again because I could not completely enjoy the movie then. In fact, being a sluggish plot, my wife was in a hurry to complete it shortly. So, I want to enjoy it alone now.\n\n5. My ideas about Thai Martial Arts changed after watching 'Ong Bak: The Thai Warrior'. The movie was about saving an artefact of a remote village in Thailand and a village warrior started the journey to bring the artefact back. I watched the movie on a satellite television channel while visiting a relative in Osaka in Japan. Some of my younger cousins were present with me there. I would like to watch it again because I could not complete watching the movie then and had to leave the place. So, I want to complete it."

    "Question": "Describe an importation occasion or event (such as a wedding or a celebration) you have attended.",
    "Question__1": "1. Two months ago, I went to Delhi to attend one of my college friends' wedding. It was a delightful ceremony and some other friends, whom I have not met for a long, also attended the celebration. I enjoyed the event very much and actually this was the first wedding ceremony that I attended out of my country.  I liked the ceremony until the last minute. The food was yummy and mouthwatering. People who arrived were very friendly and had a nice discussion with me about different issues of my land.\n\n2. The celebration of the Chinese New Year was an outstanding event for me. I attended the event this year in China. I was accompanied by my family during the event. We had great fun on this day. In fact, I enjoyed the parades and particularly the fireworks. I enjoyed the entire event as it was the first time for me to witness the celebration of Chinese New Year. We went on a family trip to China and luckily it was the eve of their New Year celebration. It seemed that the celebration is different from the other types of New Year celebration in the world.\n\n3. Usually, we do not celebrate the Christmas together but this year, it was a coincidence that we all got together to celebrate the day here in Paris. The event was attended by other family members and the cousins as well. We made delicious food, decorated the house, made Christmas trees, wrapped gifts for others and so on. I enjoyed the event much because of the people I had with me. Actually, it was a wonderful get together of all the members this year and I will remember it for a long time.\n\n4. Attending a wedding is always enjoyable to me and last month, I went to attend a wedding of a relative here in England. The event was attended by other relatives as well and we all enjoyed it. The event was held at night and so, it was more fun. In fact, I will remember the party that was held under the open sky at the end of everything. Honestly, I have enjoyed the food and beverage. The red wine was extremely delicious and increased my appetite on that night.     \n\n5. After completing graduation in July, I, with my friends, had a grand celebration here in Mexico. We arranged the party on the rooftop of Nicholas's house and around 10 other friends were there. We had a barbeque party, enjoyed action and a comedy movie and had great fun together. Besides, the live music performance by Sam was extraordinary. I enjoyed the celebration very much because this was the very first get together of all my friends and we spent the night together on the roof. By the grace of Almighty, we had immense fun that night."

    "Question": "Describe a subject you didn’t like before but have an interest in now.",
    "Question__1": "1. I did not like Geography in my school days. I was attached to the subject when I was in the eighth grade. I could not prefer the subject much in those days because it required much memorizing. And I was unable to remember the texts. But now this subject appears interesting to me. In fact, now I read it for gaining knowledge and I do not need to appear in exams. Hence, I have no tension to pass the exam barriers which provides a great pleasure to me.\n\n2. Participating in physical education was irritating to me. It was the part of our extracurricular activities in school from the very first day I got admitted there. I could not like this subject because it had no marks at all rather we had to participate in the training class in the early morning every day. But now I am fond of it because I know the value of physical exercise. In fact, my ideas have changed to a great extent about this subject. I wish I were a child again!\n\n3. I hated science more than any other subject in my school. My journey with the subject began from the very first day of my schooling here in Adelaide. I did not like it because I was unable to understand the complex terms and equations. When I grew older, I could not undergo the pressures created from some of its branches like physics, and chemistry. But with the passage of time, I have realized that science is better than any other subjects. And it helps to lead a happy and decent life with knowledge about the world. Thereby, I am now interested in science and read different types of texts and articles related to science.\n\n4. I did not have the idea that Health and Hygiene would be the most irritating subject to me in my earlier days. I got familiar with the subject when I was promoted to my ninth grade in a local school here in Oregon. I did not like it because of the many restrictions and bindings. In fact, it did not allow me to move after my will. But now the ideas have changed and I know how important it is to follow the rules and regulations. So, now this is a favourite subject of mine and I follow its directives in my life.\n\n5. Learning a foreign language (such as French) was highly difficult for me. I was introduced to this subject when I crossed my seventh grade in a reputed school here in Spain. I could not like the subject because it appeared difficult. The pronunciation, the spelling and the tones appeared irritating to me, and often I was punished for not writing the spellings correctly. But the necessity of a second language is highly important and I feel that I made a great mistake by ignoring the French language learning course in school. A second language helps to communicate better and raises the chances of success. So, I admire the subject now."

    "Question": "Describe a happy family event from your childhood that you remember well.",
    "Question__1": "1. The celebration of the marriage anniversary of my parents was a memorable experience for me. The celebration was held in our place, located in the southwest corner in Osaka, Japan. I was seven or eight years old and had lots of fun on that day, particularly while cutting the cake. Many of the relatives and friends of my family arrived at our home marking the event. And they brought various gifts to my parents but some of them brought presents for me too! For all those reasons, I can remember the event clearly even in my late teens.\n\n2. I have been born and brought up in an extended family here in Pakistan and amid thousands of events, I can remember the marriage ceremony of my eldest sister as the happiest one. The event took place in Islamabad in 2003 and was a small child of nine years old. I enjoyed with other children of my age and took the delicious meals. Every one of the family was happy. But the ending of the event was sad. My parents turned emotional while bidding farewell to my sister. I also cried on that day and so, it has become an unusual day for me engraved both with happiness and sadness.\n\n3. Traveling with family members is great fun and I went on such a family trip in Bali, Indonesia. It was 2007 and we moved there from China. It was entirely a family trip and so every one of my family was present. It was my very first experience with sea and sea beach. And I was highly glad to see the magical appearance of the sea. In fact, dad was in trouble to control me as I wanted to jump on the water. The sunset scenes, the campfires at night at the sea beach etc. everything was enjoyable. So, the memory is set in my brain even today.\n\n4. Getting a new family car was the most exciting event in my childhood. My dad bought a German-made car when we used to live in Kowloon in Hong Kong. I was too happy to see the car and wanted to ride on it. Later, dad invited all the members of the family to ride on it and he took us to a restaurant to celebrate the event. We had lots of fun on that day. And in fact, it was a dream of my dad to get a family car, and he had been trying hard to make the dream come true. He was so happy and we were happy as well. Thereby, it has become a memorable event for me.\n\n5. The celebration of the New Year was an interesting event for me and my family but the celebration in 2009 was the most memorable event for me. We all went to England to meet our relatives there. It was a nice get together. I met my cousins for a long time. In fact, this is tough to maintain the long-distance relationship (we lived in Australia then). And we passed around 15 days there amid great festivity. Based on all the amusing events, the memories are vivid in my heart."

    "Question": "Describe a long journey/short trips you would like to make again.",
    "Question__1": "1. I went to Rajasthan last year to attend an event and met some of my relatives and stayed for about a week there. In fact, it was the marriage ceremony of my maternal cousin and we all were invited to the ceremony. I enjoyed my time during the trip and as it was a family trip, all the members were present which made it more enjoyable. I would like to go on such trips again as it was filled with thrills. All the cousins were present and we did lots of exciting things together.\n\n2. I made a long drive to Idaho with some of my friends in 2015. We had a plan to spend three nights together. And it was the best journey of my life. I drove the car during the trip while the other friends sang. played the guitar and did other fun stuff. We listened to music, had campfire nights in the place, participated in dances, slept under the open sky and had more fun. I would like to go on such a trip another time with my friends to recall the memories. And I also have some other plans this time to implement during this trip.\n\n3. It was a 48-hour adventure trip with some of my college buddies. We travelled on foot across the streets of different places in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. In fact, we did not sleep during this time and took breaks in different restaurants for refreshments only. We sang, danced, drank and did many other things on the street. In fact, it was the best short trip of my life and I will remember it until my death. I want to have such a trip again to enjoy the night times in Vietnam.\n\n4. In October, last year, I went on a detoxification trip. It was a completely solo trip for seven days on an island in Indonesia. I went there for detoxification and now communicational devices were allowed there. I took foods prepared without fires, drank some herbal beverages and walked for a long. It was a nice trip indeed. And I would like to go back there again because I felt refreshed after my return from the island. The natural healing elements are present there that detoxifies the body and soul.\n\n5. The one-day river cruise that I took part in was outstanding. In fact, I did not have the idea that it would be so nice and wonderful. I went there as it was organized by my office last December. The entire trip was filled with excitement and fun. Besides, there were different sports competitions and cultural functions as well which made it more engaging. In a word, it was a refreshing trip for me. I had won a prize in chess competition. I would like to make the trip again as it was a highly refreshing one for me. I felt relaxed after I returned from the tour."

    "Question": "Describe a time when you stayed far away from your home.",
    "Question__1": "1. Staying away from home is hard indeed for a homesick girl like me. But I had to stay away from my home for about one month. I was sent to London to stay with my cousin last year. But the one month appeared the lengthiest one to me. My aunt went to meet her in-laws’ family in the USA for some emergency purposes and my cousin had to attend his exams. So, I was asked to stay with her for a month and I obliged to their request. But it was upsetting for me to stay out of the home. And this was the very first time that I spend nights out of my house.\n\n2. Last September, I went to a camping in a remote place in Vietnam. It was a place filled with jungles and we had to spend for about a week there as part of the annual camping from the scout groups of my college. I did lots of things there like cooking my own food, sleeping on the floor using leaves, making campfire nights and more. It was an interesting event for me to spend the days out of my home. And the entire event was adventurous as well.\n\n3. Sleeping by the side of mom is my favourite but recently I had to stay out of my home for some unwanted reasons. I was guilty of committing some crimes at home. I forged the sign of my dad while submitting the exam copies and when the matter was exposed, I left the home for 10 days. I took shelter to friend’s home here in Auckland and he did not inform it to anyone. I just ate, slept and played computer games. I also deactivated my Facebook profile. Later, I came back home and it was a sad event for me. My parents were almost mad and they forgave me about the misdeed too.\n\n4. Last year, I had the job of a trainer and had to stay away from home for the purpose. I went to Malaysia to train up some people on software development skills. I stayed for about two weeks there. During this time, I had to remain busy with the preparation of training materials and use them in the training sessions. It was an interesting experience for me. In fact, this was the very first out of the country trip for me and I felt excited. And I also gained huge experience from this trip too.\n\n5. Attending a study tour is enjoyable and when you are to stay away from home for a couple of weeks, the enjoyment doubles. I went to a study tour from my college last month at the National Park in Utah and spent two weeks at a stretch. It was a different sort of study tour and the university authority had to take special permission to arrange it. We had lots of fun, and real-life activities. And I will say, this was the greatest adventure of my life. I enjoyed every minute of the tour that led me away from my home."

    "Question": "Describe a handmade gift you gave to a friend or relative.",
    "Question__1": "1. On the last birthday of Elena, I gave her a set of playing cards. But the cards were different. I wrote a statement on each of the cards to make her amazed. She turned 21 last October, and she is my cousin. It was hard to make the gift and I had to spend a lot of time collecting the statements. I wanted to surprise her because such handmade gifts are unavailable at the present days. It looked nice with two rings holding the cards together and when you turn each of the cards, you will get a special comment about you.\n\n2. Making a handmade candle was tough for me but I did that to please my little brother. He scored the highest last semester and as I promised him, I gave him the handmade candle. I used a small mug and placed some liquid candles on the mug. It took time to manage the liquid candle and then coloured it as per his favourite colour. Since I wanted to do something exceptional, I got the idea from the internet and surprised him. He was startled indeed with the handmade candle.\n\n3. My uncle loves reading books and so I presented him with some handmade colourful bookmarks. He was happy with the pieces and blessed me from his heart. In fact, it was beyond his thoughts that he would get a handmade gift from me. I made some small flowers using papers, placed them on a large paper and then applied a lace. It took a bit of time for me to complete the job. I wanted to give the bookmarks to my uncle because he often loses track while reading. So, to trace the page back, I made the bookmarks for him.\n\n4. Planting trees is my hobby and I inspire people to plant trees as well. Last month, I gave a handmade small flower pot to Robin, a friend of mine from my college, and I planted a small cactus in the pot too. It was easy to make the pot. I used a small mud pot and placed some soil on that. And then I placed the cactus in the pot and used some small stones to enhance its beauty. Actually, I gave the pot to Robin for no particular reason. He expressed that he was happy to see such a thing at my home and I thought to give him one.\n\n5. Preparation of a recipe ring was a very big deal to me. But when Merry smiled at the ring, all my sufferings faded. I gave the gift to her when I went to visit her home here in Oakland. The preparation was not so easy. At first, I had to collect 50 recipes of different items and make them print in small size. Lamination of the recipes was another trouble – the laminator did not want to do that. And arranging a ring was simple. Since Merry loved cooking and was newly married off, I thought a recipe would be a nice gift for her."

    "Question": "Describe a time when you had to wait in a traffic jam.",
    "Question__1": "1. Oxford Street in London is always crowded with excessive cars and I got stuck in a serious traffic jam in this street last week. I had to wait for over 40 minutes at the same place. The moments were boring and I had nothing to do except chatting with my friends on Facebook. Honestly speaking, the traffic jam was an intolerable event for me. I felt highly irritated about the bad traffic and I have never experienced such a jam before.\n\n2. If someone gets stuck in the traffic congestion in La Rambla here in Spain, it will take a long time to get rid of that. Unluckily this happened to me last week. I got glued in a traffic jam for about one hour at the spot. And it was the dullest event of my life. I tried to listen to the radio news but that appeared less interesting to me. In fact, I was in a rush and my friends were waiting for me. So, I could not focus on anything until the traffic became normal.\n\n3. I have never found the Shibuya crossing in Tokyo free from the traffic jam. The entire area is congested with different types of vehicles and on last Wednesday, I got stuck in such bad traffic that wasted around two hours. In fact, it was unbearable for me to sit idly in the traffic jam. But I had no other options left except sitting motionlessly. I actually felt disgusted in the situation. Finally, when I got rid of the jam, I felt relieved.  \n\n4. My suggestion for the newcomers in Hong Kong to avoid the Causeway Bay. I was stuck in a traffic jam for over 50 minutes in the street here. In fact, this is a place with the thickets population. Not only cars ply on the street, but it is also packed with people of different ages. So, driving here is a nightmare and I kept praying when I was stuck in the jam. I blamed the entire system and the authority for the failure of the traffic system of the area.\n\n5. Undoubtedly, Time Square is the busiest place in New York. Last month, while returning home from work, I was stuck in a serious traffic jam. It took around 25 minutes for me to get rid of the traffic congestion. I listened to music during the entire period of waiting. But the experience was not a happy one. Actually, this is the place that always remains busy with people and vehicles. People around the world come to visit that area and thus an unwanted crowd is always there. So, this is tough for me to drive through the area."

    "Question__1": "1. Marry told me that she will be back in a few minutes and I waited for her for about one and a half hours. She borrowed my chemistry notes and asked me to wait inside the college compound here in New York City. Though I do not prefer to wait for someone, this time the scenario turned the opposite for me. I waited until she returns. It was a bothersome experience for me. In fact, I started playing games on my mobile but could not focus on that. And you know, time becomes longer in such cases.\n\n2. Waiting is unbearable for me, but recently I had to wait for my younger sister. She wanted that I should take her home from her school in the centre of Ho Chi Minh city. So, I waited for her. Though she told me that she would be at the school gate by the next 10 minutes, I waited there for around 30 minutes for her arrival. And the time was entirely boring for me. Besides, standing with a motorbike before a girls’ school is also indecent.\n\n3. Alex asked me to wait for him near his office. He was set to take the leave for that day within the next five minutes (as he told me over the phone). But he was late. I waited for him for nearly 45 minutes at the same place. And when I phoned him, he did not pick. The waiting hours were tiresome. And when he returned, he said that his boss assigned him a job suddenly and stood before him until the job was done. So, he made the unintentional delay.\n\n4. My dad is a lazy person and he makes delay often. Last Sunday, I had a plan to go shopping with him in the street market here in Singapore. And I told him to be prepared for the shopping day. But as usual, he was late to respond to my phone call. I waited for him in the garage and made phone calls on his mobile repeatedly. It was the 15th time when he picked and replied he was coming. I had to wait for over 30 minutes for him and finally, he arrived. It was a bitter experience for me.\n\n5. Indeed, this is a virtue to become patient and I am so. I waited for a person whom I was scheduled to meet last Monday at the national library here in Moscow. But the man was late to arrive on the spot at the right time. He was one hour late. So, I had to wait for him for the time being. I went to a coffee shop and had two cups of coffees. I was not irritated like the other people because I knew the late was not intentional. I, rather, tried to enjoy the moments."

    "Question__1": "1. Last  month, I attended a wedding ceremony here in Adelaide. I had to borrow a tie clip to hold my tie perfectly. I borrowed the clip before going to the ceremony. Actually, I lost my tie clip a few days ago and did remember to get another one. So, I borrowed it from Andrew. When I use my coat, I do not need the tie clip but when I am without a coat, I use the clip to hold the firm position of the tie. And since the coat was sent for a dry wash, I had to go without it. So, I needed to borrow that tiny thing.\n\n2. Attending a viva is a matter of luck here in Mumbai because the number of unemployed people is on the rise. So, I went to attend a viva and borrowed a leather bag to carry all my necessary documents. I borrowed it the night before the viva, 27th September this year, at a multinational company. I borrowed the bag from my cousin, Arvind. Actually, it was my very first viva for a job and I did not have any idea how to get prepared for it. Arvind told me to use a bag to carry the documents and lent me his one.\n\n3. My colleagues were all set to visit my home and so, I had to borrow some decorative artworks. I borrowed the artworks at noon while they were set to arrive in the evening. Mr Simpson is my neighbour and a nice person indeed. He lent me the large piece of artwork to hang in my living room. I borrowed the piece because my living room was almost empty. I have rented the apartment recently and could not manage time to decorate it perfectly.\n\n4. Celebrating the birthday of my younger sister was enjoyable but I had fallen into trouble with the cake stand. I forgot to bring it and so, had to borrow a cake stand from our neighbour Ms Julia. I borrowed the stand a few minutes before the arrival of the guests. In fact, if I had not borrowed the cake stand, it would be uncomfortable to cut the cake and distribute it among the guests. So, I needed to borrow the stand.\n\n5. On the last day of my college, I wore a diamond necklace and I borrowed it from my mom. I borrowed the necklace in the early morning of the day and also asked her to lend it to me a couple of days ago. So, mom did not object to letting me use the necklace on that special day. But she told me to be careful with the piece as it was an expensive one and a gift from my grandparents. Actually, I needed the necklace because I picked a dress which would only suit with diamond jewellery. Since I do not have my own, I borrowed it from mom."

The locality has lively galleries, hills, and obviously natural beauties. I came to know about the place from my uncle John. I want a simple home there with some essential and traditional facilities. I have a dream that someday I will have a life filled with happiness in a beautiful place. And this is the place I deem perfect for that.\n\n2. In Australia, a good number of places are available to live but I prefer Adelaide most for this purpose. The place is famous for the Mediterranean climate. Besides, there are lots of beautiful places to get settled. I came to know about the place from a friend of mine. He has shifted there and asked me to visit him. I was amazed at the natural beauty of the place. I want a simple home filled with happiness. It would be better if I get a single-storied home. The pleasant climatic condition is the best thing that allures me to live there.\n\n3. Beach towns always attract me and I have the plan to have a home in Nha Trang. This is a beach town in Vietnam and I came to know about it first when I visited there. I want a small house from where the beach would be a five to ten minutes’ walk. But the house should come with all the modern amenities. I would like to watch the sunrise from the doorstep and so, the house should be made accordingly to the direction of the sun. I want to live here for several reasons – the people there are friendly, I love to take seafood and I enjoy the sea a lot.\n\n4. Living in Sri Lanka is a matter of luck and I would like to have my home at Nuwara Eliya. This is an important city in the country but filled with natural resources. I went to visit a tea estate in the city and was in love with the place. I would like to have a duplex here and the house will come with ample space on the roof to enjoy the natural views. To be frank, I want to live in this place for the breathtaking mountain views. I want to pass my old ages by enjoying the nature of my land and this is the place to be.\n\n5. Frankfurt is a great place to live in Germany. This town comes with a wide range of facilities for the people. I came to know about the town on the internet. In fact, I am attracted to the low living cost of the city. I want a small home or it could be an apartment as well. I will decorate my home as I feel fit. I have chosen to live there because it is a modern town and it has numerous facilities that I need in my day to day life. The communication system, availability of job etc. are all at a satisfactory level."

    "Question__1": "1. Recently, I had a severe disagreement with a friend of mine and it was about buying a mobile phone. I had this battle with Jones! Resolving the disagreement was hard. In fact, I wanted to get an iPhone while Jones strongly opposed the matter. He suggested me to get one from the Samsung brand. He placed some logic to support his view. Finally, I lost the battle. In fact, I had to give up and get a Samsung S8.\n\n2. I often argue with my best friend Sara and last Sunday we had a big one. It was about continuing an affair through Facebook. Later, I gave up the affair. Sara told me that falling in love through Facebook is not the right way. Rather she suggested finding a nice guy from our university campus, here in New Zealand. I disagreed with her at the beginning and later when I realized the matters, I apologized to her for the disputes I had with her.\n\n3. Suddenly Julia attacked me with some unwanted issues. She said she came to know that I was calling her names on her back. I think she was influenced by someone else. And I was calm during the event though I was protesting the allegations. Finally, I resolved it by saying to bring strong evidence supporting her allegations. It was only then when she realized that I was not to be blamed. But already we had an argument for over half an hour.\n\n4. When someone argues about changing any universal truth, obviously the issue becomes irritating. And I had such a disagreement with a friend of mine named Julee. She was saying that she came to know that the planet March is not round rather it is in a different shape. I disagreed with the matter and asked her to place enough evidence against her claim. She was dissatisfied. Later, I came to know that she went through a science fiction where the aliens saw the planet earth in a different shape. I made the matter clear to her.\n\n5. Disagreement with the best friend is the worst event in life and I had to experience so in last month. The dispute was about making a derogatory remark about a teacher. But as far as I knew, the teacher was a wise man and never did so as he was alleged. So, I used some logic and arguments favouring the teacher while my friend Akira got angry. Finally, everything was brought under control. She eventually realized that the allegations were baseless. But I had to undergo some unwanted disagreements with her about the matter."

    "Question__1": "1. Travelling is my hobby and I also try learning new languages whenever I stay somewhere for a long. Recently I went to Vietnam and had to use the local languages. I went shopping at a street market and used the language with the local sellers. I felt excited because I was not proficient in the languages. I learned the language a few months ago and applied it for the first time here. And it was an important decision for me to know the language. I was happy that the sellers could not charge me more as a tourist.\n\n2. Meeting with Chinese people is easier if you know their language.  Last month I had to attend a Skype meeting with a Chinese client. Mr Shang Fu is my client in my office for the past five years but I did not have conversations with him before. So, I used the Mandarin Chinese (that I learned) to continue the meeting. It was an exciting experience for me. In fact, I did not think that I would use this foreign language and speak like a pro.\n\n3. I had to visit Russia last month and I used the local language of the country. I spoke with a good number of people and had set a detailed plan to establish a new outlet for my business there. I used the Russian language to communicate with them because I learned the language a few months ago and did not have chances to apply it before. In fact, I was too thrilled to use the language here. My three-month course became successful.\n\n4. Speaking Spanish was upsetting for me but I overcame the matter. I had to use the language with a businessman in Spain while I was there for some official purposes. I used the Spanish language to make him understand that he should take a lower rate for the products I purchased from him. I was worried if I could convey the message accurately or not. Finally, I was able to realize the matter and with the poor Spanish language skill, it was hard for me to do the work. In fact, this was the first time for me when I used the language with a native speaker.\n\n5. Speaking the Arabic language appeared the toughest task for me. Recently, I went to Saudi Arabia for some business needs and was in trouble as the business partners were unable to communicate in English. So, I had to use Arabic for conversation. I had some ideas about the language but I was not proficient in it. Hence, it was hard for me to meet both ends. Actually, I continued my conversation with a limited vocabulary and this was shocking for me to learn that they pronounce the words from deep of their throats. It was the very first real-life application of the language for me. So, I also felt thrilled when I finished my discussion."

    "Question__1": "1. Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin (often termed as Charlie Chaplin) was an iconic actor in the world. He looked stunning with his stick, hat, and coat. He had a distinctive walking style on the movies. And he was famous for his comical movies. In fact, most of his movies were based on comedy and he used to portray some social problems through the movies. I admire him for his special acting skills. He was able to get into the character instantly.\n\n2. Brad Pitt is a legendary actor to me for his natural acting skills. He looks very smart and has his own style. He is a versatile actor. So, he can take part in different types of movies but I liked the movies where he played some gentle roles. I admire Brad Pitt for his sincere acting skills. He is a bit different from the other contemporary actors. And he also loves to remain formal in all of his movies. He is also loveable for his special facial expression in times that really make me thrilled.\n\n3. Jennifer Shrader Lawrence is a great actress of the present time and she is also a highly paid actress. In fact, she gets the highest payment for her roles in movies – so far I came to know. She has a pretty look with a distinctive style of her own. She is comfortable with different types of character but she is perfect for characters with mystery. She can portray the character naturally. I admire her because of her intelligence and acting skills. She was the youngest actress to get nominated for two academy awards at a time. in fact, this is not possible for ordinary artists if you do not have some talents inside.\n\n4. People who love western movies will never forget Clint Eastwood. The tall-figured man suited the roles of gunslingers in the movies and won the hearts of millions of people. He mostly took part in action movies and particularly he played key roles in western movies filled with thrills and actions. I admire him for his natural acting. When I watch his movies, it appears that he is the real character. His way of talking, aiming guns and firing at a great speed – everything is my favourite."

    "Question__1": "1. The house belongs to Mr Samuel and this is located in the northeast corner of the main street of the locality I live in Thailand. The house has a grandeur look. The furniture and interior are decorated with modern design. In fact, I was greatly amazed at the inner look than the outer one. I like the house because it is beautiful and spacious. It has a very nice garden in front of the house and all the rooms are capacious. He is also planning to build a small swimming pool inside the house which would increase the attraction indeed.\n\n2. Richard took me to his apartment last month. In fact, I went there to get some music CDs. The apartment is located near the 7central station in Paris. It was a small apartment – around 700 square feet. And the inner environment was not so good. I felt suffocated after entering the apartment. And I also could not like the apartment because it not well organized. My friend Richard is a not an organized person at all. So, he keeps the place untidy which caused irritation to me.\n\n3. Living in a small apartment could be beneficial and Patrick has proved it. He lives in the opposite apartment of mine here in Japan. He is a foreign businessman struggling to settle in Japan. He has nicely decorated his apartment. In fact, he is all set to get married to his fiancé and so, decorated his apartment. The furniture and other necessaries are set in the right place. And I like the apartment for the outstanding colour combination. He has combined different shades together which makes it look wonderful.\n\n4. Marry lives with her parents in a large house here in Germany. The house is located in a prime location in Munich. This is an extraordinary house that is not available in the present days. The inner part of the house is divided into separate sections and the number of rooms is more than I imagined. The house was built a long ago by her forefathers and still bears the testimony of the past days. I like the house for several reasons and the large and spacious corridors are one of them. There are ample spaces too for recreation in large yards.\n\n5. Majority of the houses in India are smaller now and when I went to meet Mr Arvind at his house, I was disappointed to see the house condition. The house was located in a corner of the new street in Mumbai. It did not have a good look. In line with the outer part, the inner side was almost ruined. In fact, it needed a renovation. The inner part of the house was almost ruined and I was unable to stay there for longer times fearing the fall of the roof. Actually, I could not like the house from the beginning because of its too much shabby and almost broken outlook."

    "Question": "Describe a writer you would like to meet.",
    "Question__1": "1. Meeting an author is interesting and if his books are bestsellers, the enjoyment doubles. So, I would like to meet Haruki Murakami. He is a Japanese writer and famous for his outstanding thoughts and writing style. His books are sold beyond the country borders. He writes both fiction and non-fiction. I would like to know how he makes the story plots and adds new characters to the plot. I also would like to meet him because he is a living legend in different parts of the world for his novels. Meeting this great man would be a great pleasure for me indeed.\n\n2. I would never miss the chance to meet Sir Ahmed Salman Rushdie. He is a British Indian novelist. He is also famous for his exceptional essays. Many of his writings have been awarded prestigious prizes. I have some specific queries such as how he gets the ideas to make historical fictions. I also want to know about his personal life and how he handled all the problems that he experienced for his authorship. I have a fascination for this writer for his controversial writing. So, I would like to meet him.\n\n3. Meeting with Ian Russell McEwan would be a pleasure for me because I admire him the most. He is a living legend to me and this English writer has also influenced me in some aspects of my life. His first novel - “The Cement Garden” is still adored by all. Besides, he also has earned a nickname – Ian Macabre. I want to know about the way he thinks or considers things for a story. I want to meet him to talk about different issues about life and get to know his point of view.\n\n4. Many of the writers have started their writing at an early age and Michael Chabon is one of them. He was only 25 when he started writing. He is a Jewish writer and lives in the USA. He has several books under his authorship and all of them are highly commendable. And I also love his short stories. I want to know more about him like how he manages the splendid ideas and materializes the ideas through words. In fact, the way he writes is a mystery to me. I want to discover the riddle.\n\n5. Some of the writers have different professions other than writing and Rosa Montero is one such jewel. In line with her writing career, she is a successful journalist too. And she has won several prizes for her writing. I have some queries about her like how she manages time for her writing despite being highly busy with her journalism career. I would like to meet her because I also want to start writing. This is my hobby and some tips from her would be so useful to me."

    "Question": "Describe a day when you thought the weather was perfect.",
    "Question__1": "1. Having perfect weather in Russia is a matter of luck. Luckily, I got perfect weather on Sunday last. I was in my elder sister’s home in St. Petersburg. It was sunny weather and the day began with a rising sun. Since it was a holiday as well, I spent the entire day with my little nice and niece. The day was a perfect one for an outing and we played round the day in the garden in front of the house. It was perfect because the winter was gone almost.\n\n2. Rainy days are often termed as a blessing and it appeared so in the last week. It was perfect weather for me here in Paris. It rained all day long. And I listened to music on this beautiful day. I also cooked meals for myself and enjoyed two movies. Usually, I have fewer leisure hours for me due to my job nature, and so I took a break on that day. It was raining when I started for office and then changed my plan. In fact, if there were no rain, I could not have enjoyed the day.\n\n3. Walking in the morning is enjoyable when the day is moderate. It was a bright day when I went to walk in the morning last Wednesday. I did not think that the weather would be so nice. I followed my daily routine – went to my job, returned earlier and had fun with my family. The weather was perfect because the sun was not too hot that day here in Frankfurt in Germany. And I felt less stressed on this day.  Considering all the factors, it was perfect weather for me.\n\n4. Going for a long drive needs a sunny day and it was so. I went to a long drive in Victoria Drive with some of my friends. It was a nice trip and we all enjoyed this because of the weather. We went to distant places by car and enjoyed the bright weather. Perfect weather is needed to visit a distant place and luckily we had one. Besides, photos taken are also better in such weather. So, we did not miss the chance to click some photos as well. Based on everything, it was perfect weather.\n\n5. Snowfall is a common syndrome in winter in Canada, and I enjoyed the last weekend with a great snowfall. The entire area where I live in Montreal was covered with snowflakes. I played with my child on this day. We made a couple of snowmen an and it was highly interesting indeed. The weather was perfect because the snowfall started from late at night and the streets were covered with deep snow. Going office was ineffective on that day. So, I believe it was a perfect day for me."

    "Question": "Describe a TV documentary you watched that was particularly interesting.",
    "Question__1": "1. I am not addicted to television documentary but the Cold Case Files particularly appeared interesting to me. The documentary was about solving a murder case. I decided to watch it because of the suspense. I have learned how to unearth a murder case and to reach its resolution. The documentary showed how police follow a lead but fail to reach a resolution. They are in a dead-end and time passes by to figure out the right thing. So, it appeared interesting to me.\n\n2. Honestly, it would not be possible for me to do the dirty jobs that I watched a television documentary of the same name. Actually, I had no idea that so many dirty jobs are available in the world and people are doing them. I realized the fact that we should respect every job in the world. It helps to earn a living. The documentary appeared interesting because the person who features the documentary had to struggle a lot for cleaning poops of many species. And he did all the things with enjoyment.\n\n3. Usually, television documentaries appear interesting to me when they investigate issues about the wild kingdom. So, I am in a kind of love with the Mutual Of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. I selected to watch it because it was an informative documentary about wildlife. I came to know about a wide number of unknown matters from the documentary about wildlife and wilderness. The investigative video clips are highly entertaining because they are enriched with the deepest secret of the wildlife.\n\n4. People who love to believe in paranormal activities, 'Destination Truth' is the best television documentary for them. The series is about legendary creatures, paranormal activities, and ghosts. I have an interest in it and thus I decided to watch the show. I came to know various interesting information about the matter and finally was amazed. The documentary was compelling because it established the existence of some paranormal matters which are ignored in the usual sense.\n\n5. Almost all of the sports lover like me will agree that 30 For 30 is a great television documentary. The documentary is about sports and some inner events in the sports arena. Since I love to play and participate in a different form of sports, this a great documentary for me. The show exhibited a good number of matters that took place beyond the imagination of the audience. The documentary is intriguing because some of the greatest personalities took part here and shared their opinions and experiences regarding sports."

    "Question": "Describe a time when you got into trouble.",
    "Question__1": "1. Riding on public transport is troublesome in Mumbai and recently I got into difficulty. I was trying to reach my college through bus service. Amid the rush, I rode the bus but could not manage a seat. In fact, this is irritating to stand in a bus amid other male passengers. So, I had nothing else to do except waiting for a seat to be vacant. The feeling was not satisfactory. Standing in a bus is always uncomfortable and when there are men around, the situation turns worst.\n\n2. While travelling in Indonesia last month, I was in a trouble about language. After exiting the airport, I hired a taxi to reach the hotel. But the taxi driver could not understand my language and took me to a different hotel. And it was hard to manage the driver. He started arguing with me that he has brought me to the right place. Later, with the support of the local people and hotel staffs, I reached the destined hotel. I felt annoyed by the matter.\n\n3. My recent argument with my boss appeared as big trouble for me. He wanted me to do some of his personal works and I denied that. The situation appeared that I have to lose my job. Finding no other way, I informed the matter to my higher authority. Then they asked me to describe the matter in writing with evidence. So, I submitted everything and felt relaxed. Later, the higher authority discussed with my boss for his misconduct.\n\n4. Recently, I lost my mobile phone and it led me to big trouble. I went to Vietnam and lost the phone. The phone set was replaceable but the documents and contact numbers were most important than the phone set. Luckily, I had a backup of the documents and numbers on my cloud drive and I collected them from there. But I really felt sorry for my phone. It was a newly bought iPhone from Dubai.\n\n5. Street shopping in Singapore was a strange experience for me. I bought a shirt and found it torn inside. When I took it back to the shop, the seller denied to change it. So, I was in big trouble because the shirt costs a smart amount to me. So, I complained about it to other sellers and it was only then when the shirt seller agreed to change it. It was not a pleasant feeling at all. In fact, if I were a local citizen to that place, the seller could not have done this with me."

    "Question": "Describe a funny text message you have ever received.",
    "Question__1": "1. Receiving funny text messages is indeed fun if you can get the meaning. I got a funny text SMS from a friend of mine about making a remark to a teacher. John sent the SMS to me. I received it when I was in my class. It was a funny message because John was trying to make the man understand the consequences of making rude remarks but the man continued to make the remarks. At last, John had stopped by making another final remark which made the other people laugh out loud.\n\n2. A text message about losing mobile phone made me laugh. It was all about simple conversations between two persons. Samantha sent it to me when I was playing chess with my dad. The text message was funny because two people were discussing that one of them lost his mobile phone and so he was unable to reply to the message from the other part. And the man assured that he will reply soon after getting the phone back. Actually, this is not possible to send a text message if you do not have a phone and as you are sending texts, it refers that you have the phone in your hand. So, you are lying.\n\n3. I could not resist laughing from a text message I received from my wife yesterday. It was about sending the message to many other people. Maria, my wife, sent me the message. Undoubtedly, the message was funny because it read that if I do not send the message to 10 other people, I will get a Saturday after Friday. My failure will bring Saturday soon if I hesitate to send it. Actually, it was funny indeed.\n\n4. Making an apple juice needs an apple but the text message meant it in a different way. It was a hilarious joke in form of a text message. Leonardo had sent it to me last week and still, I remember that for the funny situation. The message reads that a drunken man put an iPod on the blender. He wanted to have apple juice and his wife rejects to talk with him for this reason. It was tough for me to stop my laugh after going through the message.\n\n5. Before reading the text message, I did not have the slightest idea that a joke can create a break up between couples. Huang had sent me the text on the last week and I received when I was on the bus to return home. It was a funny message for its nature and I do not think that a relationship should break for some silly matters. The SMS read that a lady wanted to have a poem from her counterpart and the man-made a bit fun of her. She replied back that she will stay no more with the man. But the tone of the text was funny indeed and I actually have no idea what happened finally."

    "Question": "Describe a rule you did not like in school.",
    "Question__1": "1. Doing all the homework by myself was the most irritating rule in school, in my opinion. But the rule was appreciated by many other people while the majority of them were against the idea of homework. I have violated the rule several times and been punished as well. I did not like (and still do not prefer) rule because doing homework was annoying. After reaching home, it becomes impossible to start tons of homework assigned by the teachers.\n\n2. Some may take is as strange and oppose my views but I do not like the rule of switching off phones during the class hours. Many of the people may back the rule for maintaining discipline but I have some other alternatives to the issue as well. I often had broken the rule and kept my mobile phone on during the class hours but in silent mode. I could not like the rule because a student might need to attend any emergencies. There might be an accident in the family. And the phone of the student is shut. So, it may result in negative consequences.\n\n3. Getting organized in all the matters is nearly impossible for anyone let alone the students. Some of the matters might be jeopardized and this is natural. But people take it as a syndrome of ill manners or a sign of insincerity. I have often violated the rule. An outsider might not get the thing they want from my desk, but I knew the right places to get the things I need. In fact, this is not always possible to remain alert and do the right thing in right the moment. So, becoming organized in all the manners, especially in school, is unfeasible.\n\n4. Bringing all the necessary instruments for the practical classes in school is highly dissatisfactory. There is a mixed reaction to the matter. I have violated the rule several times. It happened that I forgot to bring the scale or ruler for the practical class. I did not like the rule because this is not possible for each of the students to care about the things they need to bring to the lab. Rather, the labs should provide all the necessary instruments needed to complete the classes.\n\n5. Talking about personal issues is forbidden in the classroom and I am against the rule. A majority of the students are against the rule as well. And I have violated the rule several times. In fact, I have the most important friends whom I share each and everything in my life. And it is unfeasible for me to meet them after the class as we do not live in the same area. So, when talking about personal business is banned in the classroom, this is highly irritating for everyone, I think."

Anderson is a poet of this contemporary age. And I know him because he lives next door. He is a great poet indeed and his words are strong. I know him for the past five years. He rented the apartment before mine and rarely met him in person owing to my own occupational engagement. He is famous because his poems are published in newspapers and magazines. Often he is interviewed as well in mainstream media outlets.\n\n3. Sophia is a news presenter on the local television channel here in Russia. I know her because she is my cousin. She is junior to me by two years and I know her since her birth. She is a kind of celebrity in our town. She has an extraordinary style of news presenting and her pronunciation is lucid. She also can manage situations in the newsroom very well. Considering all the grounds, she is a successful news presenter and a famous personality by her own qualification.\n\n4. Usually, football players are famous in my country and Richard is one of them. He plays in under 20 leagues but has gained huge popularity indeed for his smooth performance. I know him for about a year ago, he came to me to meet some of his official needs. Richard is famous for his special style of scoring goals. He is also skilled in managing a team very well. Even he has been highlighted in some international sporting events held here in London.\n\n5. \"Hature\" is a famous YouTube celebrity and he is my relative. I know him from a long ago and have subscribed his official channel on YouTube. He is basically famous for pointing out the contemporary issues and finding potential solutions to them. Some of his videos went viral because of the contents. He is also skilled in shaping up public opinions on critical issues so that they could be used to make a peaceful society."

    "Question": "Describe a letter you have written to someone.",
    "Question__1": "1. Honestly, I am not enthusiastic at writing letters but had to write one for one of the colleagues. He left the job from our company and joined another one. So, I had to write a recommendation letter for Jones. The letter described his qualities and how he performed during his tenure while his stay with me. In the beginning, I felt confused about what to write. But later, I adapted to the matter and praised him heavily in the letter.\n\n2. My visit to China was a fruitful one and I bought an electronic device from a local manufacturer there. So, I wrote a letter to the seller of the product and asked him to describe the functionality and how the device works. In fact, I was having trouble in operating the device. I was worried whether the supplier would respond me or not. Later, I made a long-distance call and informed that I have sent a letter. I was assured that I will get a reply within a short time.\n\n3. The letter I wrote last week was about following up about the order that I placed to a software firm. I wrote the letter to the CEO of that Japanese company. In fact, my bank had ordered a customized software for its smooth operation and we had an agreement to be provided with the software in a month. Since there were no responses from the other side, I wrote the letter. I felt a bit discomfort to use some harsh words in the letter and also suggested not to grant those as personal.\n\n4. Placing an order and through issuing a letter is really irritating. But I had to follow my official rules and wrote a letter to a local supplier to provide with necessary stationery items for my office here in Mexico. I had to write the letter because there was an acute shortage of stationery items in the office. So, I wrote in detail about our needs and also asked to deliver the products as soon as possible for him. I did not have any special feelings about it as I have to write such letters often to meet my official needs.\n\n5. Writing love letter is a big deal. It requires a lot of attention and also an expression of love. I wrote a love letter to my girlfriend to propose her to be with me for the rest of her life. Marry agreed happily. I had to write this because I could not bear the emotions inside my mind anymore. Writing the letter was tough for me because I was not sure if she would accept it or not. Besides, my inexperience in the matter also weakened me.\n\n6. I was responsible to invite my relatives to my elder sister’s marriage ceremony and I wrote a letter to my pen friend in England. The letter was about inviting him to the ceremony. I wrote the letter to Julia and invited her to be present at the ceremony that was supposed to be held in the last part of September. I was filled with thrill while writing the letter. In fact, I had seen her only in virtual media and her arrival in my land would be a great event for me. So, I was delighted."

He is a professional guitar player and has his own underground band. I borrowed the guitar to play at the birthday party of my niece. In fact, it was not a big deal for me to borrow the guitar because we have a very good relationship between us. Even he borrows some of his necessities from me. So, he did not mind lending me the guitar.\n\n2. On the early morning of last Sunday, I had to go to the airport to receive my uncle at home. But unluckily my car was not working properly. It was malfunctioning for some mysterious reasons. So, I borrowed the car of my neighbour Mr David. He was a gentleman and lend me the car without asking any further questions when I described everything. Initially, I felt ashamed to ask for the car but later, all the shyness vanished when I came to know that my uncle was waiting for me at the airport.\n\n3. Recently, I needed two extra chairs and I borrowed them from Ms Natasha who lives the opposite door of mine here in Kazan, in Russia. I had to borrow them because I was unable to accommodate all the guests in my living room. I only have five chairs and I had nine guests on that day. I did not feel uncomfortable about borrowing something from Natasha because she is my friend as well. And the case is the same for her.\n\n4. Camping in remote areas is a good idea but when there is no flashlight, you may feel trouble. So, I borrowed a flashlight from my neighbour - Julia. She also loves to spend time camping at night and she has all the necessary camping equipment. As I forgot to buy a flashlight of my own, I borrowed it from her. In the beginning, I felt awkward and Julia discarded my shyness. She took the matter normally and inspired me to plan in a better fashion.\n\n5. Mr Jones is a good reader and has many books in his house. So, I borrowed a book from him. I borrowed it because I did not find the book in the local bookstalls.

    "Question__1": "1. I frequently visit the Hell's Kitchen Flea Market for various reasons. The market is famous for selling products like books, antiques and electronic items. The market is not so big and contains not more than 50 shops altogether. I enjoy visiting the market because I can get things at a cheaper rate. Prices are negotiable and you do not need to bargain sternly with the merchants. Hence, I am a regular visitor to the market.\n\n2. I consider myself lucky to be born in China and by the side of the Wangfujing Snack Street. In fact, this is the market that sells different types of local snacks and many other types of food. This is a moderate market and roughly 40 shops sell various types of food and beverages. I love to visit the market because it comes with a wide variety of food and at a reasonable price. This is the single marketplace that sells almost all types of local snacks and food items. The food is tasty indeed.\n\n3. The China Town market in Singapore sells almost all types of products. It mostly sells clothing, antiques, Chinese herbs, jewellery, handicrafts and more. This is a large market covering a huge area. I enjoyed visiting the market mostly for the variety of the products.

I was looking for a pair of shoes in New Delhi last week during my official visit. Someone from the team suggested to visit the Dilli Haat and it was a great experience. The market sells various types of products and services. The food items were very special to me. The market is not so big and contains around 100 small stores altogether.

The Oedo Antique Market is one of the largest open-air street markets in Japan. It is available on certain days only. And it sells a wide number of antiques. In fact, if someone needs an antique piece, the market is the perfect place to get the right product. I enjoyed visiting the market as I bought a large antique clock from the market. I also bought some potteries from the market a couple of years ago and they are still in operation. But as a consumer, you will need to bargain about the price.         \n\n6. Finding no other way, I visited the Austin Renaissance Market on 23rd Street. It was a nice place for getting different types of products.

    "Question__1": "1. Learning to ride a bicycle was an interesting adventure for me as I did not have the experience before. So, learned to ride a bicycle. I did this here in Vietnam a few months ago. I learned it with support of some of my cousins. They actually helped me a lot to learn to ride a bicycle. It was a new activity for me. And as a girl, I did not think that I would be able to ride a bicycle in my life. But my thoughts changed after learning it.\n\n2. Passing night out of the home was an interesting event for me. And this was a new thing as well because I have never spent a single day out of my home. So, I felt a thrill inside my mind. I was accompanied by some of my friends. In fact, we all had planned for a party at night on the rooftop of a friend’s home. Accordingly, we arranged everything and spent the night very well. I enjoyed the barbeque party too much and it was a fresh experience for me indeed.\n\n3. Going for a long drive in the daytime, and amid a busy day was interesting. All the elements to get irritated was present there but I ignored them. I took a long drive from Ohio to Dallas. It was a long way and also crowded. My buddy Robert and Sam accompanied me on the trip. It was an exciting trip for me because all of us knew that we would not complete the trip in the day for many reasons. But we took to attempt to make it happen and in fact, this was the very first trip for all of us together. So, it was exciting.\n\n4.

    "Question__1": "1. Raising consciousness is a great job but it needs special efforts. Benjamin Franklin is one of those leading personalities who had devoted his entire life to helping people in terms of raising their awareness through writing. He was born in the USA in a large but poor family. He was a prolific writer than any other of his professions. His writing helped to raise a sense of awareness and the humour also attracted attention from a large part of the society. Recently, I have read an article authored by him and realized that he was a great man with a modern thought even in his days.\n\n2. South Africa is indebted to Nelson Mandela for his outstanding role to emancipate people from the mental and physical domination of different issues. He was born in South Africa and had to lead a struggling life. He struggled against racism. He wanted to bring a balance in society. He never desired that the blacks or the whites would be dominated by each other. Rather he dreamt of a society that will bring harmony and peace. I had no idea that he was such a great man until I read an article in a newspaper in my school days. Earlier, I thought that he might be a local leader but his biography changed my idea about him completely.\n\n3. The theory of relativity is probably the greatest achievement in physics and has helped greatly to improve this branch of science. Albert Einstein is the founder of this theory. He was born in Germany and later received US citizenship. He helped to expand some of the branches of science. In fact, the Quantum Theory and theoretical physics are the greatest contributions of this scientist. I came to know about him during my physics class at my school. The teacher was describing him and asked us all to collect a few more insight into this great personality to present in the next class.\n\n4. Disability is a great issue of concern in the present perspective and Helen Keller is a pioneer in this case. She was born in Alabama but her childhood illness caused the greatest damage to her life – she became deaf and blind. She initiated movements to raise social awareness among the mass people. And she is most famous for her charity works for the blind people. I came to know about her from a friend of mine who works at an international organization named after Helen Keller. It was a great event for me to know about this philanthropist woman despite her handicaps.\n\n5. Among the Greek philosophers, Socrates is most celebrated for his outstanding way of expressing the truth. He was born in Greece and mostly known for his ethics. He wanted to share his knowledge with his students and fellow people. But he had to sacrifice his life as the rulers of that time did not want him to express the truths. Being a student of history at a local university in Indonesia, I came to know about him. In fact, I had to prepare an assignment on him which made me aware of his contributions to the Greek society and the consequences of his life."

    "Question": "Talk about a historical building in your country or city that you know.",
    "Question__1": "1. The Hawa Mahal is located in Jaipur in Rajasthan, India. The building was built in the 18th century for the women of the royal family. It was built for them to observe the street life of Jaipur. In fact, they were not allowed to go out of the home. The edifice is mostly known for its structural beauty and has become a key attraction for tourists in the region. The structure is made of sandstone. The sandstone is pink in colour. The front wall looks wonderful with its extraordinary design. This is a five-story building that comes with a pyramidal shape and 50 feet in height.\n\n2. Ho Chi Minh City is filled with different types of historical buildings but I like the Mariamman Temple the most among them for its architecture. The temple is located in a prominent space of the city and has been named after a Hindu goddess. It was built in the 19th century to serve the religious purposes of Chettiar community living in Vietnam. The temple is most famous for the statues it contains. The outer wall of the building comes with some statue of Hindu gods and goddess. There is a mandapam (main hall) inside the temple that serves the key role for the devotees there.\n\n3. Amid numerous historical places in Spain, the church of the Holy Family is my preferred one. The church is also referred to some other names. The construction of the church began in 1882 to serve the local Christians. The structure is minly famous for its architectural design. It has square towers with three fronts. Four columns are dedicated to four saints of different age. The facades depict some stories before the birth of Christ. The six large inclined columns have added the beauty of the structure. Some of the sculptures also depict some important events of Christ’s life.\n\n4. The city hall subway is located around the City Hall in New York City. It was opened in 1904 but no longer in use these days. In fact, it has become a secret subway station in the city. It was built for better communication across the city. The subway looks beautiful with a nice design and the lighting system was improved lately. The station was also used to take trains from north to south for mass communication. But for some unknown reasons, the train communication stopped here and the building is not for commoners’ use. It is used only by the Transportation Museum members.\n\n5. I am proud to be a Brazilian because of the heritage I have in my country. And I love the Cathedral of Brasilia more than the other structures in the country. It is located in Brazil. Though this is a cathedral, it has a different look than the usual cathedrals. In fact, it has a unique look. It was built in 1970 as the seat of the Archdiocese of Brasilia and to serve the Roman Catholics in the locality. And the structure is mostly known for its architectural beauty. The cathedral has 16 concrete columns and gives a shape of Indian teepee rather than a church."

The role of Jackson as a family friend is still memorable to me. He was my dad’s colleague and lived in the next door here in Spain.

This is a highly useful piece of electronic equipment because it entertains us. in fact, television is the source of entertainment and information for many of the people in the world. They use television for numerous reasons.\n\n2. Life would have been harder if there were no mobile phones, and to be more specific, it is iPhone. I have learned to use an iPhone all by myself. I bought the phone using my own bucks. And I have been using the phone for over the last five years. I think an iPhone is an interesting and highly useful electronic device as it helps to meet all the necessary needs of the present days. The photos taken using the phone are wonderful.

    "Question": "Describe a trip which was not up to your expectations.",
    "Question__1": "1. Visiting the tourists' spots in Greece was always attractive to me but this time I could not enjoy the trip out there. I went to visit the most remarkable places in Greece but I was not lucky enough to have spaces for me. The entire places were crowded and people from home and abroad appeared there to see the wonders. I actually expected that I should get some calm and peaceful place but I was wrong.\n\n2. The last trip to Indonesia could not give me a complete sense of joy. I went there to enjoy the natural views and particularly the sunset scenes. But I failed to enjoy my planned activities due to foul weather. In fact, I could not observe the sunrise for a single day. The entire sky was filled with dark clouds. So, the sun rays could not land on the planet and it was my bad luck. I had plans to take some exclusive pictures of the sunrise and sunset scene for my personal exhibition but I could not do that.\n\n3. Expected that the trip in India would be interesting but in reality, it was not up to the mark. I heard lots of amazing stories but the real scenario is different. I went to check some of the noted tourist spots but could not find the charm. Besides, the excessive crowds on the spots were highly irritating to me. So, I returned on the halfway. In fact, I had a plan to take 10-day tour in India and I completed that within four days. Therefore, I cannot consider it a great trip for me.\n\n4. An exciting issue indeed to talk about but the memories of the last trip are making me sad. I had several negative experiences when I went to Singapore. I went for some business purposes but something bad happened to me. I lost my wallet, my cell phone and other necessary documents together. It became tough for me to get back home. Somehow, I managed the situations but will never forget the events that I experienced in the country. It might be my luck that did not suit the trip this time.\n\n5. Rarely I make a trip because of lack of time. But this time it was in Vietnam and I was forced to make it for my wife. She went for some research works and I had to accompany her. I thought she would take me with her in the research fields but I had to pass boring moments near the hotel swimming pool. She had spent round the day in collecting data and information with the local associates and I just passed some dull moments inside the hotel boundary where we stayed in Vietnam. So, it was not a good one this time."

So, I check the news and get the latest updates. The app is important because I have less time to check the newspaper and I remain busy round the day. So this is unfeasible for me to collect the newspaper and know everything. Hence, the app is important to me.\n\n3.

It was done on an experimental basis. And I was happy with the outcomes.\n\n2. I did not have any idea that it would be so difficult to make a snowman using the cotton buds. In fact, I had to make it for my little daughter. She wanted to have a snowman of her own and thus I made it to her. I used different ordinary items like cotton buds, paper and glue to make it. When I presented the snowman to my daughter, she was amazed. And I also felt proud. I took the idea from the internet to make such a snowman but felt a bit difficulty in its making process. Finally, it was a nice handicraft.\n\n3. The celebration of the birthday of my baby boy was interesting. And I made some paper caps for the other kids who attended the party.

I felt glad when all the children wore the caps and everyone present at the ceremony praised my initiative. Though it was an experimental matter, I was happy with the result.\n\n4. Making of the elephant cards was not that much hard but it took time for me. I made the cards using paper, balloons. At first, I attached a balloon on a piece of small paper that I attached to the card front part. Initially, it was troublesome to complete the task but I became an expert when I started making several other cards. I did not have an idea that I would do so great and it helped me to restore confidence in me. Besides, the card receivers also adore the card-making process.\n\n5. I wanted to make a special gift for my niece and so I made a tic tac toe for her.

    "Question__1": "1. Proper housing is a great problem for the inhabitants of England. The number of residents has increased to an unbearable extent. So, this is becoming hard to accommodate all the people together. In fact, many of the people from around the globe and the country flock to this city to get a good living and lifestyle. To reduce the problem, I think the government should take some decentralizing steps. Then people would not need to crowd in London alone.\n\n2. The issue of public safety is a great concern in New York City. This is, in fact, a highly serious matter. The problem is caused by multifarious issues. Overpopulation, unemployment, racism etc. all are responsible for public safety issue. Though there are some rules and customs to follow, the majority of the people are unaware of them. So, public awareness should be raised in the first position. Moreover, the law enforcers should also be careful about the public safety issues. They need paying more attention to the matter.\n\n3. India is troubled with some serious types of problems and air pollution is one of them. Most of the large cities are polluted by air and the issue is so serious that people need to use masks to prevent them from dust while moving on the streets. The air is polluted basically from the burning of fuels and oils. A good number of mills and factories also contribute to this case. Solving the problem overnight is nearly impossible. Mass awareness is required about the air pollution issue. Besides, the mills and factories should be replaced in out of city areas.\n\n4. Health care is a problem for Vietnam and particularly in the Ho Chi Minh city. This is a serious problem and often the hospitals have less or in some cases no arrangements to deal with the critical patients. Moreover, the old buildings that hold the hospitals cannot accommodate all the patients together. The root cause of the problem is poverty. In fact, the eradication of poverty is the key way to reduce this problem. When people will have enough money with them, they can have better treatment.\n\n5. In Islamabad, transportation is a great concern for everyone. The issue becomes serious in the early parts of a day when people move to their offices or other destinations. The lack of public transportation is the key reason to cause the problem. Besides, often the roads are congested with a good number of vehicles and movement becomes impossible for people. Proper urban planning is required to solve the problem. The streets should be expanded too."

I know the language, I know the customs and also I have the idea of where to visit to observe Japan closely. Based on the fact, it would be a special trip for me."

    "Question": "Describe a story that was particularly interesting to you.",
    "Question__1": "1. The story centred a seller and a buyer and I heard it from a friend while having a group chat in my place in Dammam in Saudi Arabia. We all planned to get together in the evening and my friend told the narrative. This was an interesting story because I could not think that it will end in a funny way. The beginning was troublesome but the end was interesting indeed. And in fact, the ending was beyond my expectation.\n\n2. I heard the fable about a clever farmer and a fox. My grandmother told the story long ago but still, it has the same appeal to me. On a moonlit night, the world was flooded with a silvery brightness and I heard the story with some of my cousins. The moments were outstanding. And might be the story was simple but had a long-term impact on me for the environment. The story also had some twists that were particularly interesting. considering everything, it was interesting to me.\n\n3. A saying goes that excessive clever people often get cheated for their overconfidence. And I heard a story of similar issues recently. A colleague of mine was telling the story that he had experienced before him. After lunch, we were gossiping about petty issues and suddenly he told the short story. It was amusing because the clever man got his punishment. In fact, it was natural and people who try to prove themselves extra smart are always naturally punished.\n\n4. The story of three runners appeared interesting to me and I did not believe that stories might end this way. All of them won finally for their internal bond. Maria told me the story during the evening break from the college class. The story was interesting as it contained many real-life lessons. Winning a match is not everything in life rather winning a heart is the best success. So, I was inspired by the story and since then tried to win the heart of people. Hence, it was exciting to me.\n\n5. I was not interested in mythological stories but my ideas changed after listening to one of those. Hanson told me the story during a conversation. It was on the evening of Monday last and we met at a café in Vietnam. Both of us were international students in the country and often spent time together. He described the story of the gift of fire. It was interesting because I came to know how the fire came to the earth. Though there are no scientific explanations available backing the story, it was fascinating indeed."

    "Question": "Describe a product you bought and felt happy about.",
    "Question__1": "1. The chopping board was an essential product for me and I bought it last month. I actually needed the chopping board for the cooking purpose. I was having trouble cutting the kitchen vegetables. I have been using the board for past one month and I am happy with the board as it has made cooking easier for me. Actually, cooking foods take less time but its preparation is lengthier. With the chopping board, I can cut and prepare the vegetables and other food ingredients easily, thus cooking has become easier for me.\n\n2. Recently, I have bought a Samsung smartphone. I needed the phone for some reasons and have been using it for a month. I am happy with the phone because it comes with the latest features. I can now use the phone for browsing the internet, making phone calls, chatting with friends, playing high-resolution video games and for numerous other purposes. Honestly, I am happy with the phone because it has fulfilled my desire for the latest smartphone. Earlier, I had a Symbian phone set that I used to meet my ordinary purposes and started feeling the necessity of a smartphone. The phone that I have now has met all my needs. I am quite happy with that.\n\n3. I love to wear perfumes and recently I have bought the perfume of a special brand. I have been using the perfume for the last two weeks. When I was in Italy, I used this brand and it was satisfactory. Later, when I returned to my native land, Indonesia, I had been seeking the same brand but could not find that. Luckily, I got a bottle from a brand shop who imported European perfumes. So, I bought it and felt happy to wear it again.\n\n4. I had been looking for a quality baby oil for my child of two years old. I needed that because he had a little bit of dry skin. So, I bought it from an online shop and have been using it since Monday last. I was happy with the baby oil as it was helpful to keep the skin moisture at the desired level. The dryness of the skin was reduced and my baby was comfortable with the oil. Considering all the matters, I was happy with the baby oil.\n\n5. My wallet had torn for overuse and I bought a new one. In fact, I was in dire need to have a wallet but could not get the right one I required. After lots of search and exploration, I got this special piece. So, I was happy. Besides, the wallet was made of complete leather. The seller also ensured its quality and gave a warranty for two years. Moreover, the wallet price was reasonable too. So, based on all the aspects, I was happy with the wallet and using it with deep satisfaction."

    "Question": "Describe a piece of local news that was interesting to you.",
    "Question__1": "1. The news was about the survival of a lady with a banana in a week.  And I was amazed at the news. I came to know about the news in a local newspaper here in Uttar Pradesh in India. The story described a woman who eats a banana in a week. She eats nothing else and has been living in this way for the past few years. The news was interesting to me because I cannot even think of adopting such a living style. And she is fit and well with a single banana in her old age.\n\n2. I could not stop thrilling when I came to know that a teenager can turn his head to a 180 degree to look directly backside of him. I read the news on an online web portal while browsing it. The story was about a teenage boy in Pakistan. The boy was able to turn his head a 180 degree. By this turning, he could look his backward. The news was interesting because I have not seen such a thing in my entire life. And I tried to do so. All my attempts turned into a failure.\n\n3. To get fame, people do bizarre things and a similar event took place recently. I came to know about an internet prankster who cemented his head in a microwave oven. I read the news on the internet and was astonished. The news read that a prankster wanted to amaze his audience and thus he cemented his head inside a microwave oven. But the prank went serious and it took about one hour for firefighters to rescue him from the situation. It was interesting as I came to know about the foolishness of people.\n\n4. The matter of showing off is prevalent everywhere and the rising stars often do the same. I came to know about such an issue in Russia that some of the rising stars hire an aeroplane and take some photos. Later, they post the photos on different platforms to create an illusion of their wealthy living. But in reality, they are not so much wealthy at all. The news appeared interesting because it exposed the reality behind the show off of the stars.\n\n5. A recent news in Italy arrested m attention. A couple of Italian bank robbers used a mask resembling Donald Trump, the USA President. I heard the news a couple of days ago. The news presenter described that a couple of bank robbers have used the mask during the heist. The police have recovered the masks and I laughed out loud. In fact, it appeared a kind hatred towards the USA President that even the bank robbers are also disliking him. So, the news was interesting to me."

    "Question": "Describe a photo of yourself you have taken.",
    "Question__1": "1. Last month, I took a photo of mine using a small digital camera. It was a kind of experiment because for many reasons. At present, the availability of selfie is everywhere and people mostly prefer taking selfies for many reasons. But I do not prefer to take selfies and make some duck faces. I took the photo to post on my social platform. Though it was not an interesting photo and I am not a professional, I liked the photo. It was testimony that I can take photos without using selfies.\n\n2. The selfie that I took last weekend was extraordinary. I took the photo using my iPhone 7plus. It was a very special photo to me. I went to meet my local friends and to make the event memorable, I took the photo. Usually, selfies are captured through mobile phones and I did the same. It was a nice photo indeed. Every one of us was smiling and when I posted in on my social profile, many of the people had loved the photo.\n\n3. Mirror photography is a kind of exceptional practice and I can do that very well. On Friday last, I had a day off from works and so I wanted to spend the time effectively. I used my mobile phone to take some mirror photos of mine by hiding the camera on the photo. I took the photo to master the art of hiding the camera from the mirror. After several attempts, I captured the perfect one. It was perfect. Just I was reflected in the photo and my mobile phone was absent. It was a smart photo indeed.\n\n4. Currently, the use of selfie sticks is random among people because they want to take their own pictures in selfie mode. I also did so. Yesterday afternoon, I went to a rooftop restaurant in Paris and took such a photo using a selfie stick. Actually, I wanted to see how a selfie stick is effective. Thereby, I clicked the photo. The surrounding environment was excellent. The sun appeared with low brightness and the other elements were calm and peaceful. The environment reflection on the photo made it look wonderful.\n\n5. Capturing a picture using the self-timer of a small digital camera is hard indeed. But my experiment went successfully. I went to visit the Red Fort in India last month and took such a picture. I took the picture to know how actually it works. And I was amazed at the result. But I had to make some prior arrangements like placing the camera in the right position, setting up the timer and other tasks. I posted the photo on my Facebook profile and everyone said it was a great photo."

    "Question__1": "1. Meeting with Mr Robert and his family was a new experience for me. He has a small family of three members – Mr Robert, his wife Isabella and their daughter Maria. Each of the members is a good fellow. And I like the family for their hospitality. I went to Britain for some academic tasks and stayed their home for a few days. They were highly cordial to me and honestly, they took great care of mine that I did never receive before at anywhere. So, they are on my favourite list.\n\n2. I was impressed with the family of Richardo and its traditions. Richardo has a large family consisting of nine members. In fact, he has to care for a few relatives who live with him in his residence in a remote part of Spain. They appeared very good humans in all terms. I like this family because of the extensive number of family members. I have spent a very good time with all of them. In fact, they all loved to have fun with me. The family environment is cordial indeed.\n\n3. My friend Salma has a nice family consisting of four members. She lives with her husband and two children here in Mexico City. The family environment and all the members are pleasant. I got to know them during an official occasion. I am in love with the family for their warm and friendly behaviour. All the persons were helpful even the youngest member as well. So, whenever I can manage time, I move to meet them. And they also love me much. In fact, invisible bondage has been created with the family.\n\n4. I heard about the cordiality of Iranian people and had experienced in last month when I visited the country. I met with the family of Mr Adel Bin Ahmed. He has a moderate family with six members including his maidservant. All of them were nice people indeed. They supported me all the time during my stay at their home. I like the family for its abidance to religion and hospitality. I stayed with the family for three weeks and did not felt for a single moment that I was an outsider.\n\n5. Rosy is my colleague and she has a nice family. She is single and lives with her parents here in New Jersey. She has two more family members. She lost her brother in a car accident back in 2010. That was sad indeed. Her parents are well-mannered and love to meet and greet people. When I first went to meet her at the home, I met with her parents and it was an interesting experience for me. They all greeted me warmly and were nice all the time I was there. So, I like the family."

    "Question": "Describe a place you visited that has been affected by pollution.",
    "Question__1": "1. My recent visit to Zabol in Iran has given a different experience to me. The entire region is filled with air pollution. I went there for some business purpose and found that the air is heavily mixed with dirt. It is hard to breathe in the air. Besides, the localities are also polluted with some other types of pollutants that cause habitation troublesome. The lack of awareness of the locals is the key cause of pollution, I believe.\n\n2. Tangshan in China is a highly polluted area in the country. I had to visit the area for some commercial purposes and set some strategy to expand my business in the region. The locality is affected by air pollution. Smokes emitted from the mills and factories are the key pollutants. The indiscriminate establishments of mills and factories in the region basically are responsible for the environmental pollution here. Some other causes of overpopulation also contribute to degrading the environment.\n\n3. Water pollution is a great concern for Dammam in Saudi Arabia. My office sent me there to make some background works for establishing a branch and I was unhappy with the environmental concern. The entire city is suffering from water pollution and even the drinking water is also polluted to some extent. Unplanned urbanization, the indifference of the municipality to check the matters are behind the pollution. The rise of shallow water may also be a potential concern in the coming days.      \n\n4. Lahore is a crowded city in Pakistan and I went in the city last week on a trip with my friend. The trip was intended to shop for the marriage ceremony of my friend’s elder sister. But I found the city filled with pollution. Almost all types of pollutions were there including noise and air. The cars and other vehicles on the streets were largely responsible for noise pollution while the factories polluted the air. I think unplanned urbanization is largely responsible for the pollutions.\n\n5. I gained a weird experience in Greater Cairo in Egypt. I went to visit the pyramids of the country and experienced noise pollution there. The city appeared overcrowded to me and thus the level of noise is out of tolerable limit. A good number of noise sources are active there including the vehicle horns, use of loudspeakers, shouts of street sellers among others. People are not careful about the matter and they behave insanely while creating the noise."

    "Question": "Describe a person whose job is important to society.",
    "Question__1": "1. Everyone should admit that the role of a teacher is undeniable to form a civil society. So, Mr Hans is playing the role from a long ago. He is a university teacher here in California. He is also a social scientist as well. He helps to build a nation. Dissemination of knowledge is the foremost task to form the backbone of civil society and he is playing the most important role in sharing knowledge and ideas among his students. This is in fact, a highly important job for the social betterment. Students will learn and in future, they will form a nation based on their learning.\n\n2. The doctors have much contribution to society and my uncle Abdullah is a doctor. He is a doctor, specialized in medicine and has his own chamber in the centre of Kuala Lumpur. He helps people by advising about their illness and how to improve the situations. His job is important because if there are no doctors in society, it would be difficult to lead a happy and healthy life. Doctors are always there to serve the people in their needs regardless of time and financial abilities.\n\n3. Have you ever thought of food production? In fact, they are farmers who directly are involved in food production and keep everything on. My relative Le Huang is a farmer and he grows food crops in Vietnam. By producing food crops, he supplies them to the local market and people get the crops to meet their hunger and live on. This is a great contribution to society. In fact, his job is important because if farmers like him stop food production, there would be a disaster in society.\n\n4. Honestly, we never consider the job of a firefighter important for society. But in reality, that profession is highly important. I know a man named Markus who is involved in the profession of a firefighter. He is responsible to control the fire-related incidents and he does that perfectly. A sudden fire may damage properties and lives, while the firefighters try to defeat the fire. Thus they serve society to live in peace.\n\n5. Majority of the people have no idea what happens with the garbage that we dispose of. In fact, the garbage collectors help to clean the garbage and keeps the environment clean. Samuel is a garbage collector and cleans my domestic garbage everyday morning. He helps to keep the locality clean and nice. Without his help, it would have been difficult for us to live a decent life. Think a day when there is garbage everywhere. Hope this would be clear to describe his importance in society."

    "Question__1": "1. Reading is my hobby and often I borrow books from people. So, last week, I borrowed a book from Peter about space science. I borrowed the book because I did not get it on the local bookstall here in California and it was Peter who owned the book on my network. Actually, I cannot stop my curiosity once it begins and after reading the blurb, it appeared that I need the book. Since I cannot manage that, I borrowed it.\n\n2. I borrowed a video game CD from a friend of mine. I borrowed it from Anderson. I wanted to play the GTA V. This is the latest version of the series but did not get that on the internet. By the same time, I could not find it in the local stores here in Brussels. So, I needed to borrow that. I love to play video games and the GTA series is my favourite. I have played the former versions of the game and wanted to play the latest one. But being unable to collect the CD, I borrowed it and installed on my computer.\n\n3. My carpet became too dirty last week due to the weekend party. So, I needed to clean it and thus borrowed the carpet cleaner from my neighbour Mr Moriarty. He is a professor of mathematics at a local university here in England. As I do not own any carpet cleaner, I needed to borrow that. All my relatives gathered at my place marking the birthday of my younger daughter and I allowed everyone with their shoes. So, the carpet got too much dirty with various types of unwanted objects. It needed a proper cleaning.\n\n4. Attending an interview requires formal outfits that I do not have. In fact, as a student of graduate level, I am unable to bear the cost of a suit. So, I borrowed a suit from my friend, Robin. He is also a foreign student like me at the University of Tokyo. I borrowed the suit to attend an interview for a job. In fact, this was the very first interview for me and a local corporation asked to appear with all necessary documents and a formal look at the interview date.\n\n5. I wanted to spend a week at the Utah National Park but I did not have a portable stove to cook for me and my fiancé.  So, I borrowed the stove from a friend of mine named Julia. Actually, I decided to camp for the first time and did not have the knowledge what might need to pass a night in out. When I completed the list, I found that the stove to cook is missing and so, I needed to borrow that. If I failed to manage the stove, I had to take some canned foods. Do you think this is wise to have canned foods in camping at such a nice place? So, I borrowed the stove and it was highly important."

    "Question__1": "1. Recently I attended a recruitment test in Berlin and the exam was a difficult one for me. I took the exam last January. It was a special test for me because it was the very first recruitment test in my life. The exam was difficult as I did not have any clue that the questions would be so unpredictable! Besides, I was not prepared for such a competitive exam.\n\n2. The multiple-choice test in history that I took a few months ago was very tough for me. I attended the exam at my college and it was an academic test for me. The questions were extremely hard. I could not answer them properly. As a result, the exam was unsatisfactory and carried a poor grade for me!\n\n3. My participation in the essay writing exam in my literature class was quite hard. The exam took place a few weeks ago at my college. It was a compulsory exam for all the students in the class. So, I had to take it. The exam was hard because I did not have the necessary preparation for the essay topic. And the teacher randomly gave the essay topic to students. Therefore, I could not answer well in the exam.\n\n4. Attending an academic viva is easy if someone has precise preparation. But during last semester, it was so hard for me as the questions were very difficult to answer. The viva took place at 10.00 am at the college campus in Toronto, Canada. I had to take the test because without participating in the viva, I would not be allowed to get a promotion to the next session. The viva was hard. The teachers asked questions which were unfamiliar to me.\n\n5. I attended an improvement test in my office as I applied for a promotion. The exam was held three months ago. I took the test to prove my capacity for a senior position in line with some other participants. But the exam was really hard for me. In fact, the authority wanted to bring out the essence from the candidates applying for a higher position. Besides, the majority of the questions were strategic and required real-life skills or experience to answer. So, it was tough for me to answer all of the questions."

    "Question__1": "1. I went to enjoy the annual sports event last year that was held at my college in Barcelona. I requested a fellow student to book a seat for me as it was rush inside the auditorium. But it was a mistake and I forgot that Nicholas was a stubborn boy. Actually, he opposed me always in the class. So, when he denied my request, I felt irritated and blamed myself for requesting him to book a seat for me.\n\n2. My last visit to (...say the name of a place...) was not satisfactory for many reasons and I particularly noticed some events. I asked for a change to a shop owner after purchasing some stuff from his shop. The middle-aged shop owner turned down my request. He simply refused to change a note. It was a sad event for me. And in fact, I am not habituated with such refusals. Changing a note is not a big deal and people get the change placidly. But alas! I was refused.\n\n3. Usually, cricket match ticket sellers do not deny to sell tickets. But when I asked a salesman a few months ago to sell two tickets, he surprisingly denied it! I requested him to sell two tickets to me, but he did not pay heed. The young seller in his blue eyes looked nice. But he did not pay attention to my request for selling an extra ticket. I was even ready to pay a higher price than usual. Initially, I did not know why he did this and later came to know that selling two tickets together was disallowed on that match day.\n\n4. I was flying to Indonesia from Thailand last month on a flight and during the travel, I wanted an extra glass of juice but I was denied! The beautiful looking air hostess politely denied my appeal. And I felt a bit insulted. The airliner was charging more than usual but they do not have an extra glass of juice! So, I pledged that I will never fly with this airline. When I informed it to the cockpit, they apologized.\n\n5. Travelling is my hobby and I prefer bus journey. Last month, I went to Singapore on a bus. I asked the man beside me to leave me the window seat as I needed some fresh air. The man denied my request. It was a troublesome situation for me. I was feeling uncomfortable and wanted to sit beside the window. But the man did not allow me. And I also could not manage another window seat. It was an uncomfortable journey indeed."

    "Question": "Describe your idea of making a good first impression in a job interview.",
    "Question__1": "1. Making a good first impression is important because it helps you being selected for the job. Besides, I think making the last impression is equally important like the first impression. I would do it by knowing the job description properly. I believe the best way to make a good impression is to get proper ideas about the job. The employers want to know how much the candidate knows about the job and company and if they are satisfied, the impression lasts longer.\n\n2. Having a good first impression in a job interview is important as the impression lasts till the last working day of the employee. I would do it by following the right dress code for the interview. When the employers see a nice-looking man, they start assuming something good about him and the impression becomes pleasant. So, I think that if a candidate can go with the nice attires to attend an interview, surely s/ he will have a positive result in the end.\n\n3. A good first impression is important because it helps create a permanent impression on the mind of the employer. Similarly, this is also important to have a good last impression. I would like to do it with punctuality. I would like to be at the interview spot on time. It will help the employers understand my punctuality and also raises the chances of getting the job. I will follow the method during an interview.\n\n4. A first impression is important as it will remain the same as long as someone works at any organization. So, to get something good, you need to have a good first impression but the story is not the same as the last impression. I have a plan to take only the necessary essentials during an interview. In fact, I do not want them to know about my entire profile unless they demand so. I will take the academic credentials and other necessary documents in a small file. It will help create a good impression on me.\n\n5. Since the good first impression lasts longer, it is highly important. I would plan to create a good first impression in a job interview. At first, I will explain myself and reasons for applying for the job. Then I will explain gradually every detail they want to know from me. By this way, I believe it would be a good first impression on my employers."

    "Question__1": "1. Missing a bus is not an unusual event for me. In fact, I am habituated with the experience. But the consequences were horrible last week when I missed a bus to reach my office. I was set to go to my office located in the downtown of Hanoi. I was in a rush and reached the bus stop late for several reasons that day. So, I missed the bus and planned for alternative transportation. However, I reached office late on that day and could not attend the board meeting to set the strategic planning. My boss was not happy about it.\n\n2. While my stay in Germany last year, I missed a bus. I was set to go to Munich to meet a friend. But I missed the bus as I reached late to the bus bay. After missing the bus, I had to wait for the next bus. But the next bus arrived after an hour. I waited until the bus arrived. And it was a lesson for me.\n\n3. Last month I was set to travel to Italy from France but unfortunately, I missed the flight. Actually, I forgot about the flight schedule. The aeroplane flew in the morning for Italy and I reached the airport in the evening. It was the mistake of checking the time. I did not notice the time correctly. Later, I had to take another flight in the early morning the next day.\n\n4. During the last summer in Atlanta, Georgia, I missed a bus. The bus was set to return to my own city and unfortunately, I missed that. It was entirely my fault to miss the bus. I actually had no idea that the bus stop was far away and I started walking to the bus stop instead of taking a ride. So, I missed the bus and I had to wait for about two hours for another bus. Actually, there were two buses available in a day to take passengers to my city and I missed the first one.\n\n5. I went to Nepal last year for a pleasure trip and had the experience of missing a train. I was supposed to visit a tourist spot which was accessible by train only. As I could not understand the train schedule due to the language barrier, I missed the train and went to the station after around one and a half hours later. I had nothing else to do other than waiting. The moments were wasted."

So, I had to rely on a complete stranger. I asked him to hold my backpack when the bus started to move. Later, I came to know that he was Mr Alex and works a few blocks away from my office. I had to trust him because it was difficult for me to ride on the bus with the backpack.\n\n2. I love to travel and often need to trust outsiders in different places. But meeting with a stranger in Mumbai was completely different. I could not get the name of this young boy. I had to trust him because I wanted to get a picture of me and my wife at a tourist spot in India. After clicking a few shots, the boys asked for money. It was surprising to me though I paid a five-dollar bill to that boy. In fact, I had no idea that someone could demand money for only clicking some pictures.\n\n3. Honestly, I do not trust unknown people and my experiences are bitter. But this time, I had to trust a man named Joseph. Actually, I wanted to get a ticket for a football match in Barcelona and failed to get in the queue of the ticket booth. So, I sought help from this person. And this gentle and kind man got tickets for me as he was in the front row. If I went to the queue, I could not have managed tickets for that match. Thanks to that good fellow.\n\n4. Recently, I went to Berlin and took supports from a stranger. I lost my purse accidentally. So, a woman named Alberta came to my help. I had to trust her because I had no other options left. I stood alone at the station and tried to get help from someone to get back home. Finally, Alberta approached me. I shared a ride with her and trusted her from the very beginning.\n\n5. A few days ago, I had to trust a stranger. The man helped me to avoid some unwanted troubles. I could not identify the man but he was cooperative. Without any reason, some youths were teasing me on the road. I was returning home from my university and then this man came to my help. I trusted him and he saved me from a bad situation. He shouted at the boys and escorted me to my home. I thanked him for his courage and support for me at a crucial moment."

I knew him through Twitter. I really liked one of his Tweets and could not refrain from commenting on it. And the friendship grew since then. I met Robert in person last March and our friendship is around 10 months old. Since we are in the same city, we try to meet once in a while. But most of the time we are engaged in our social platforms. It is nice indeed to have a friend like him.\n\n3. I feel lucky to have Nubia on my Facebook friend list. She is from Egypt and a really good person. I met her on Facebook last year. Since then, we are friends. Actually, I went to visit her social profile sensing it a fake one when she commented on a post I shared. And gradually, I found that I was wrong. She appeared to be introvert but possesses a good heart and compassion for others. I often chat with her online and also make voice calls. She loves commenting on my posts too and often posts hilarious comments.\n\n4. The use of Twitter is not so much prevalent these days in our country but I met with Fukumi at this very platform. She is a Japanese young lady and is active in social events like me. I knew her from Twitter and we are using this social platform for a couple of years. We often chat using our Twitter accounts and share our updates. When we talked, she discussed her dreams to contribute to her nation’s development. I appreciated all of her initiatives when I learned about them.\n\n5. My LinkedIn profile attracted attention from many quarters and I met with Harry there. He is a business professional in Malaysia and a good soul too. He asked me to join his company last year but I had to decline the offer for my current job. Since then, a sense of fellow-feeling has grown between us. To maintain online friendship, I often send him a message on his success. He also congratulates me when he read that I have done something good. And this has become a trend for us. Hope, someday I would meet him in person."

    "Question": "Describe a time when you had to wait in a long queue.",
    "Question__1": "1. Right before the cricket match between India and Australia, I had to wait in a long queue. It was a very long line that I could not see the end. In fact, everyone was about getting their entry tickets to the stadium here in Australia. It was a high voltage match between the top two teams in the world. But waiting in the queue was not such a bad experience for me as I started feeling the vibe. It was a nice experience for me indeed.\n\n2. Collecting the college admission form for my younger sister took me more than two hours due to a very long queue. Around two hundred people were standing in front of me and I failed to estimate the number of people standing behind me. It was almost a year ago and the bitter experience still lingers. In fact, admission to a reputed college requires a good result from the students’ end, and the guardians need to wait in the queue to collect and submit the admission form. I had to collect the admission form for my sister as my father was busy in his office. At a time I felt quite bored.\n\n3. A local theatre hall in Paris was filled with an audience. But I had to stand in a long queue before entering the hall. The gate was supposed to open at 6.00 pm sharp but the authority opened it 30 minutes later. People who arrived at the theatre hall formed a queue before the entrance. But none could enter until the gate was opened. I was one of them. So, I had to wait in the queue for over half an hour. But the moments passed by talking with the other people and I heard many interesting remarks about the show from them.\n\n4. I went to Mumbai from Kolkata before the Diwali and had waited in a long queue to collect the train ticket. It was my first visit to Mumbai by train and so I was thrilled. But the long queue made me frustrated. Over hundreds of people were in the line to get their tickets for the train. Besides, the sellers inside the booth appeared working too slowly. So, it was taking more time than usual. I was irritated with the matter but waited patiently till my turn came to collect the ticket.\n\n5. Meeting with the Prime Minister is a matter of luck but I was invited to meet the Prime Minister of my country, Pakistan. But I had to wait in a long queue to meet the Premier. It was a courtesy call with the Prime Minister with all the journalists. And as a reporter, I was lucky enough to meet the head of the state. Hundreds of people were in the queue and I was behind almost fifty people. I did not feel any monotony to wait in the long queue because it was a special day in my life."

    "Question": "Describe a night when you could not sleep at all.",
    "Question__1": "1.  Usually, I do not like to watch horror movies but last weekend, I watched a really scary one and had to pass a sleepless night. I went to visit my maternal uncle in Seattle and met my cousins. They were fond of horror movies and compelled me to watch one. The name of the movie was 'Annabelle' and the impact of watching this movie was disastrous. I could not sleep the whole night. Whenever I closed my eyes, I felt like someone was near me. The experience was not entertaining at all. Literally, I slept when the night was over.\n\n2.  I had to pass a sleepless night a couple of weeks ago when I went to my village in Uttar Pradesh. I went there to meet my parents and other family members. But I did not know that a musical event was arranged in our village on that very night. Some of the local musicians performed in the event, so I had to sacrifice my rest for that night and enjoy the concert to the last minute.\n\n3.  I am unable to stay awake late at night but recently I had to remain awake for the whole night. It was the annual sports competition at my university here in Greece and I was assigned to complete some tasks before the event. But owing to sickness, I could not complete them in due time and had to work hard to complete them before the event day. So, I could not sleep that night. It was an irritating experience for me.\n\n4.  Last September, I passed a sleepless night. In fact, I was at my friend’s place to celebrate a bachelor party. We had a plan that will not sleep at that night and enjoy our time to the fullest. Everything went well and we had tons of fun. The barbeque party was outstanding. But there was no liquor for us and we just drank soft beverages during the party. I felt glad indeed. Actually, it was a great gathering for us and we felt like as if we went back to our childhood days.\n\n5.  I never prefer to pass sleepless night but this time I had to change my decision. I was in the middle of a cabin on a train. It was an official journey to the northwest part of Germany. I had another partner with whom I played cards for the rest of the night. In fact, I do not sleep well at an unknown place and it was out of the question that I would sleep in a fast pacing train. It was an interesting journey and thanks to the friend who did not sleep to play cards with me."

    "Question__1": "1.  I had no idea that such an unpleasant event would take place in the early morning of an important day. Dad got angry with me but I could not sort out the reason! Actually, I deleted some files from his laptop and when he sat with the device, he found the files missing. He asked me to make a copy-paste and I did the opposite. I was nervous with the behaviours of my dad. He later apologized for his rudeness and told me that I made a grave mistake. I expressed my regrets to dad also.\n\n2.  It was almost a few months ago when Samantha and I started enjoying a movie at my home. Samantha got angry with me for several reasons, I guess. First of all, I love to enjoy a good action scene a couple of times. So, I started repeating the scenes, and it annoyed her. She started shouting at me and when I stopped the movie she got angry.  Later, I said that I will not repeat any scene again though I could not keep the promise!!!\n\n3.  I scarcely cook at home but last month when I tried to, it was a devastating event. My mother got angry with me. In fact, I could not cook well and it was a complete wastage of food ingredients. Almost all of the items were overcooked. The taste was weird and none could eat the food. So, my mother turned angry at me and ordered me never to move to the kitchen. So, I felt a bit disheartened with her statements.\n\n4.  Breaking down a precious and antique showpiece is really horrible and I did that a couple of weeks ago. So, my mom got angry with me about the matter. Though I tried to make her realize that it was not intentional, rather a pure accident, she did not pay heed to me. She was angry at her level best and kept shouting. Later, feeling sad and frustrated, I promised her that I would bring a showpiece for her which would be much better than the one I broke! When she calmed down, she apologised to me and I said that I was sorry for the event.\n\n5.  I recently made a mistake and it was purely unintentional. But it made a pedestrian angry. I threw a used tissue from my car, which I completely regret now, and it hit a stranger. In fact, it was a stupid act and I promised never to do that again. I stopped my car and apologized to the man for the act and he told that he was okay as I stopped to beg for an apology."

The plot of the novel is based on the French invasion of Russia and its impacts on the social and political climate of the country. Stories of five Russian families have been portrayed here very lucidly. So, I want to read this book.\n\n3.

I cannot imagine that a monster-like creature can be so popular in the history of world literature. But I might be able to imagine it if I complete the book named the Frankenstein. The book is authored by Mary Shelley, one of the most talented female writers of all time. I came to know about the book from a teacher at my college. He was describing his experiences of finishing the book and I was thrilled to learn about the writer and the plot. The story appeared interesting to me and I wondered how a man could create a monster like Frankenstein and how his feelings can touch the heart of millions.\n\n5.

He loved me very much and I always wanted to be with him whenever he was at the house.\n\n3. Mr Robert was a paying guest at my residence in Athens. He had lived with me for around one year. He came to Greece for some research works and it took him a long time to complete the work. He moved to live with me because my place was located near the archaeological site he was working on. It was a nice experience for me. In fact, I did not have the idea that a research work could run for over a year, and he was an active participant in the research. Overall, it was a pleasant experience for me.\n\n4. Uncle Richard is my dad’s friend and he moved to Munich to live with our family in early 2016.

    "Question__1": "1. I could not believe that my supervisor will come with an apology and it was an unexpected event indeed. He apologised to me because of his harsh behaviour with me that morning. I was at my desk when he came to apologise to me. I was not ready for such an event. In fact, I felt highly embarrassed then and could not find any word to say. When he came to seek an apology, I was not actually ready to respond!\n\n2. A few months ago, a waiter who behaved a bit rudely apologized to me. I was at the restaurant here in Paris and went there to have my breakfast and morning coffee. But the waiter made a mistake and when I told him politely, his behaviour turned rude. Later, he was forced to apologize. Though I forgave him, I decided not to visit the restaurant again but later discarded the idea. It was not the restaurant's fault.\n\n3. An apology from a bookseller a few weeks ago was totally unexpected to me. In fact, it was my mistake that I broke a nice-looking showpiece in his store. But he apologized because he thought he did not place the showpiece at the right place. I was in his shop when he was sought for an apology.

He was very cordial and understanding.\n\n4. A biker sought an apology to me a year ago for obstructing my way. In fact, it was not intentional at all.

The revolution involved a wide number of people and is notable for overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic system in the country. This is an important historical event because it has changed the course of modern history, particularly in France.\n\n2. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln is an important event in the history of the USA. On April 14 in 1865, the 16th President of the country was assassinated during attending a play at a theatre in Washington.

The partition of India and Pakistan was an important event in the history of this region. The event took place in 1947. In fact, the year is also known as the ‘Partition Year’. Due to the separation, two different states were born, namely India and Pakistan. India is also known as the Hindustan because of the majority of the people believe in Hinduism. On the other hand, Pakistan was formed by the Muslim majority population who used to live in the 'greater India' at that time. The separation of East and West Pakistan in 1971 was also a result of this event.\n\n4. The event of the gold rush was a historical event for my country, Australia. The event took place in 1851. Before the discovery of gold in Australia, there were some rumours around about gold. But not every one of those was true. The event had brought different changes in the lineup of the then colonial government in the areas. The economy of the country was destabilized too with the discovery of gold in the surrounding areas.  \n\n5. The end of the Second World War was an important event for Thailand. The War ended in November 1945. The global war came to an end after huge destruction and damages across the countries and many nations were involved in the war. It was an important historical event for Thailand because the country had to return the territories it obtained during the war. If the territories had been in its possession, the total areas of Thailand could have been far wider than it has now."

He was an inventor and industrial designer. I came to know about him while using an iPhone. I did not have an idea that the smartphone is the brainchild of this person. He is admirable to me for his contribution to technology. He played an important role in the improvement of the microcomputer and mobile phones.  \n\n2. In the film industry of Bollywood, the name of Aamir Khan is on the list of most creative persons. He is a film actor, host, activist and producer. He knows how to win the heart of people with an emotional touch. He applies some unconventional methods to express his creativity and finally he wins everything he desired. I knew him from my childhood for his special performances in the movies and got amazed at his capacity to portray the characters. I admire Aamir Khan as he has established himself as one of the most popular figures of the country although his beginning was not that much prominent.\n\n3. Leonardo da Vinci was a famous painter and mostly known for his portrait – Mona Lisa. He had a deep sense about everything and he used the sense in his paintings. Almost all the paintings from this great painter are thought-provoking. A man without creativity is unable to arouse the curiosity of the world. In fact, he is a subject to study for many. I first read the name in my history book and it described him as the greatest painters of all the time in the world. I admire him for his multifarious talents.\n\n4. At present, life without a social platform like Facebook is unimaginable. And the man behind the platform is Mark Zuckerberg. He had a great vision even before anyone else thought it.

I admire him because he realized the needs of communication and took initiatives to invent the most necessary thing of the present day. He was also the founder of AT&T that people in the USA are accustomed to as a telephone subscriber."

He presents the programme in an outstanding way. He directly takes part in the dangerous and adventurous activities that amaze the audience. I like this TV presenter because he has overcome all of his physical hindrances towards adventure.\n\n2. In the entertainment world, I adore Oprah Winfrey more than anyone else in the USA. She hosts a talk show and the show has become famous around the world. She hosts the show in a lively manner. She wants to know about various things through the show and digs out some interesting facts about the people she interviews. I like Oprah Winfrey for her outstanding talent. In her early life, she underwent a good number of misfortunes and have overcome them. She is the most powerful living woman in the world at present.\n\n3. The media industry in China is filled with different types of people and among them, Elena Kong is my favourite one. She is a multitalented personality and famous as a TV presenter.

I like Elena because she performs her role as a presenter exceptionally and her lucid voice attracts everyone’s attention.\n\n4. Among the other television presenters, Carol Nakamura appears different to me. She was a regular presenter of a popular Brazilian television show named Domingão do Faustão. It was a great show.

    "Question__1": "1. In Thailand, it takes a person to reach at least 18 years to get the drivers’ license. I came to know about the fact when I went to learn driving at a local driving school. I have crossed 18 in last year and now I am eligible to have my own driving license. People below 18 are immature and usually causes accidents. So, they are not allowed to get the license. Considering the ground, the rule is important for Thailand.\n\n2. Within the urban areas of Germany, the speed limit is set to 50 km per hour. This is a great rule to follow and I came to know about it a few years ago when I started driving in Dortmund. I follow the rule exactly. First of all, the rule is made for the security of drivers, vehicles, and properties. Usually, the urban areas are crowded and driving at a high speed may bring devastation. So, the rule is important to follow.\n\n3. Unnecessary beeping horns are prohibited in Australia. I came to know about the matter during my first ride in the country after migrating from New Zealand. I always try to follow the rule. Maintaining silence is a must to prevent sound pollution in the country. So, the drivers are trained to drive silently and they only beep the horn when there are chances of collisions. So, I think the rule is highly important.   \n\n4. Using seatbelts has been made compulsory for the passenger in the front seat of a car across Qatar. I went in a short visit in the country and sat on the front seat of a car. The car driver informed me about the matter. And since then, I started following the rule. In fact, using the seatbelts in the front seat helps to prevent an accident. The riders in the front seats are at risks of serious damages if there is an accident. But the seatbelts help to prevent them from falling out of the car while the airbag also helps to stop them falling. No seatbelt means a higher risk of life.\n\n5. Drinking alcohol while driving is not allowed in Malaysia. It increases the chances of an accident. I came to know from a newspaper about the matter. I obviously follow the rule. In fact, I am not an alcoholic and so, I do not have chances to drink while driving. This rule helps to save lives. Earlier, many of the accidents had happened as the drivers were drunk. Even some of them lost their lives. So, the rule is important to save lives while driving."

The celebration of the All Saints Day is an important day for the people of Great Britain. The day is celebrated on the first day of November annually. It is the time to pay tribute to saints across the country and the world. This is a type of religious festival. So, it usually does not have a universal appeal. And I ensure my participation in the events of the day. Despite the fact, the day is important because the people pray for the saints and their souls. In return, they expect the same from the saints to have a happy and prosperous life.\n\n3. National Freedom Day is an important day for the USA people. This is a special day but not a public holiday. It is celebrated on February 1 each year. The other days are observed amid festivities but there are some exceptions in observing this day. People mostly take part in academic and discussions.

Observance of \"May Day\" in China is a wonderful activity. The day is celebrated across the country with different types of events and shows. The celebration is different because people of all spheres get on the streets to enjoy the shows and parades. All the cities are filled with people – either participating in the parades or enjoying them. The day is celebrated with great importance because it was the protest to change the working hours. People had to work longer hours in past and the day has changed the system. So, it is important to celebrate it.\n\n5. The Valentine’s Day is celebrated across the globe on February 14th and Thailand is not an exception to embrace the celebration. I celebrate the day by wishing to my family members. Since I do not have any boyfriend, I do not need to wait for their wish or to wait to wish them. The celebration of the day is interesting. The day is more popular with young people than elders. They celebrate the day and share their feelings and emotions. Often they propose each other and thus the day is important for them and other people."

Luckily, I reached the office and returned home safely at the end of the day without any legal trouble.\n\n3. I forgot to take my mobile phone with me when I started college in Tokyo.

Last weekend, I forgot to get the bus ticket for me that I bought the previous day to make a trip. It was important because, without the ticket, I would not be able to ride the bus and make the trip happen. I thought that I have taken the ticket with me and I did not crosscheck the matter. Later, I went back to home when I found no ticket with me. Luckily, I did not miss the bus as it was a bit late.\n\n5. I went to my office without feeding my fishes at the small aquarium. It was highly important because the fishes will remain starved for a long time. I had to prepare some presentations and some other complicated calculations for the office. So, I might have forgotten about feeding fish. When I remembered that I did not feed the fishes, I rushed back to my home – located in the eastern corner of the Paris city- and fed them. By the time, I informed the office about my late appearance."

    "Question__1": "1. Joseph was my roommate at my university here in Paris. In fact, both of us were international students here. I lived with him for around three years. I had to live with him because the university authority assigned a double bedroom for us and he was my partner in the room. After completing graduation, both of us went back to our respective country and got split. But I have a cordial relationship with him even today.\n\n2. I lived with Mr Henry when I was in the USA. I lived with him for over eight and a half years. We were colleagues and rented an apartment near the office here in Chicago. But as he got married suddenly with his fiancé, he left the apartment. So, we are not separate but we have good bondage between us. I often go to meet him and his wife. And recall the days when we used to live in the same apartment.\n\n3. Samantha, my elder sister used to live with me here in Melbourne. I have been living with her since my childhood. My parents allotted the same room for me and her. So, we shared the room at the house and now the entire room is mine. She has been married off recently and got her own family in another city. So, I miss her often. But this is good that she has got a family of her own. And often I go to visit her and recall the olden days together.\n\n4. My grandpa was the oldest person in my family and used to live with him. I lived with him for over five years together. He used to share my room with me because of the room shortage in the house. It was an extended family in India and all my relatives used to live together in the same house. After his death, I owned the room entirely. But I often feel lonely and remember all the memories a gathered with this old wise man.\n\n5. Living with my younger brother was an interesting experience for me. We used to fight all the time. I have lived with him for a long time – approximately 11 years. I loved him so much and so my parents made an arrangement for our living together in the house. He is now a matured man like me and has gone abroad for pursuing a foreign degree. So, I have become alone and living in the same place without his presence. But when he returns occasionally, he still loves to share my bed"

    "Question": "Describe something you have that you no longer use.",
    "Question__1": "1. It is an old phone book that I do not use any more. I have used the phonebook for a couple of years when I was a student. And I have been preserving the book for over the past nine years. I used the phonebook to get the phone numbers and make phone calls to others. I do not use the phone book anymore because of technological advancement. Now I can save all the numbers and other contact details on my smartphone memory. So, I do not need that to use.\n\n2. The wristwatch that I used before is no longer with me. I had used the watch for around five years. I used the watch to know the time of the day. Even, I used the wristwatch to set alarm to wake in the early morning. But now, I do not need to take support from the wristwatch. I can do everything on my electronic gadgets like phone and computer. Moreover, wearing a wristwatch appears troublesome to me because the glasses break often and I do not notice that. So, I gave that up.\n\n3. With the advancement of time, digital photo albums have replaced the old-fashioned photo albums. I had a photo album in my childhood that I used to preserve all the photos. I used the album for about six years and still, that is in my possession. But I no longer use it as all the photos are captured in digital mode and I save them on either my computer or on my google drive. Besides, preserving photos on digital formats help to protect them from getting damaged.\n\n4. I inherited a typewriter from my grandpa. And I used the typewriter for over two to three years. I used the typewriter to learn to type and improved my typing speed indeed. But the typewriter is not in use now though I have saved it in my private store. Instead, I use my computer to type anything. Besides, there are fewer hassles in typing on a computer than a typical typewriter. I do not need to worry about the paper or making any mistakes while typing. So, gradually the typewriter has lost its appeal to me.\n\n5. My Encyclopedia that was given as a birthday present is of no use to me now. I have been possessing the book for over the past eight years. In my teenage, I used the Encyclopedia to seek any references. But I do not need it right now. Seeking a reference is a few clicks away from me. Besides, the book appears old with the passage of time. Considering all the reasons, I have given up using the book as a reference for anything I need."

    "Question": "Describe your favourite park in your city.",
    "Question__1": "1. Hyde Park is located in West Central London. I can even walk there from my living place. In fact, the park is a few minutes’ walks from my residence. I go there almost every day for my morning walk. There are ample spaces inside the park for walking. This is my favourite park because it comes with some outstanding natural views. The spaces are larger than the other parks in the city of London. It also provides fresh air in the morning hours.   \n\n2. The Weston Bend State Park is located near Kansas City. I need to ride on my vehicle to reach the park. I visit the park at least once a week because this is a bit far away from my place. This is my favourite park because it comes with some special facilities like camping at night. Often I arrange for a camping night at the park with my friends or family members. We spend some quality times there. Sometimes, we arrange for a campfire and take our meals there too. So, for all the grounds, I prefer the park.\n\n3. The Port Campbell National Park is located near the Victoria State’s Shipwreck Coast. I need to take a ride to visit the park. I visit the park once a month and spend the day there. This is my favourite park because of the nice views it offers. The walk route on the Great Ocean Road makes me feel thrilled. I love the orchids lying beside the streets and the wildlife is also adorable there. So, I love the park much.\n\n4. In China, Lushan is a great place to hang around. This is located in a distant place and so I need to use my car to reach there. So, I cannot visit the park every day or in a week. Rather, I visit the place in a regular interval of around two months. The park is on my favourite list for its natural beauties. There are ample spaces filled with gardens, mountains, and lakes. Spending time by the side of the lakes and enjoying the silence is my best-preferred activity. So, I love the park.\n\n5. Kerama Shotō National Park is located in Okinawa Prefecture in Japan. The park is far away from my residence and so I need to take several trips to reach there. I visit the park occasionally after every three or four months later. Despite being a park, it provides swimming facilities for visitors. Snorkelling is another entertaining activity there. Based on the grounds, this park is on my top favourite list."

    "Question": "Describe a good law in your country.",
    "Question__1": "1. The hike in the minimum wage for workers is a very good law in the UK. I came to know about the law from a local newspaper here in Yorkshire. People are happy with the decisions, particularly the law has changed the lives of the working class people. This is a good constitution because it helps to elevate the lives of working-class people across the country. They are having access to a decent life. So, I think, this is a good law for the country indeed.\n\n2. The child abuse prevention act of the USA government is a great law. I came to know about the law during a research work about child molestation in the country. People also have welcomed the law warm-heartedly. The law prohibits all forms of child abuse and the violators will be punished severely after the law provisions. The law also has ordered to reduce juvenile harassment and all sorts of negligence to the children in the country.\n\n3. Escorting females to the police station by female police officers is a great law in India. I came to know about the law through a television advertisement. The common people have admitted that this is a good law for the country. Earlier, to control situations or violence, the police force used to take control of everything and the male police members used to arrest everyone including females. But such arrests created unwanted situations. Hence the law orders to use female police officials to arrest females or deal with them. So, I think this a good law in reality.\n\n4. Law in Japan orders all the foreigners to keep their passports all the time with them. This is a very good law to prevent unwanted crimes and situations. I came to know about the law from a newspaper article. People of the country have also praised the regulation to an extreme extent. This is the law that will help make all the foreigners in the country aware and they would not dare to get involved in criminal activities. Considering the ground, this is an effective law, I believe.\n\n5. Drinking alcoholic beverages is usual in Thailand but if someone takes a photo with the beverage, that is a punishable offence. While reading an article on the Internet, I came to know about the law. There is a mixed reaction among the Thai people about the law. Some of them have praised it while some others oppose it. But I think this is a good law because it will refrain people from posting photos with alcohol. It will help to reduce moral degradation as well because often such photos go viral that may have detrimental impacts on society."

    "Question": "Describe a method that helps you to save money.",
    "Question__1": "1. Saving money is one of the obstinate jobs in the world. However, to achieve it, I have opened a bank account. I opened the account around one and a half year ago. This is a common method in my country, Thailand, to open a bank account to save money. After the end of a year, I have found that I have saved a smart amount of money and also needed not to cut any of my budgets. I had to deposit a certain amount at the bank for saving purposes. So, it was effective for me to save money.\n\n2. I have given up watching television to save money. In fact, I use the internet instead of television viewing. I have been following the method for the last six months. This is not a common method in a state like Illinois. When I gave up television, I started saving the subscription bill. So, after six months, I have found that a notable amount of money has been saved. I used the savings to open a scheme with a local bank here. And if I continued watching television, I think I could not have saved the amount.\n\n3. Preparing gifts for an occasion is a great way to save money. In fact, I often need to attend different social events. And I have been following the method for the last two years. It may sound weird to many to prepare gifts at home and deliver those on occasions. It is an effective method as it helps to cut the unnecessary costs. When someone makes a gift at home, the cost is reduced than buying it from a gift shop. All my expenses were half in the past year for the home-made gifts.\n\n4. I prefer to swap books instead of buying them from a library. I love to read books and have a huge collection of different types of books. I have started exchanging books form other people or from the local library to meet my needs. This is not practised widely. In fact, people are not aware of the fact that a new book costs them more than swapping it with others. It is effective for me and saved a notable amount of money in the past two years.\n\n5. Credit cards are traps. They allure people unnecessarily. So, I have given up using the credit card that I had from an international bank operating here in Malaysia from a few months ago. This might not be a conventional method for everyone as they cannot give up the allurement. It helped me greatly to cut my costs into halves. This way I saved a notable portion of my income that I used to pay to the bank to recharge the credit card."

    "Question": "Describe your favourite bird.",
    "Question__1": "1. The house sparrow is my favourite bird. This is a tiny creature with a lightweight body. The bird is available across the UK. I love the house sparrow because it helps me to get up from sleep every day. This is the only bird that does not make any unnecessary noise. Besides, a house sparrow also looks very nice with its coloured feathers. Its beaks are smaller and it has an overall attractive look. Considering all the matters, this is my favourite bird.\n\n2. I love to hear the noise of woodpeckers. In fact, the hairy woodpeckers are my favourite birds in this state, Ohio. The bird has a smart look with a large beak. The colour may vary often but most of them are available in black and white. They are very common in the USA. The sound created by the bird is awesome. Moreover, I adore the labour it invests to dig a tree. So, this is my favourite bird.\n\n3. Though three separate species of this bird is found, I like the black and white magpie. The birds are available in separate colour combinations and the average size is around 43 centimetres. The back markings of the bird are different than the other types of this species. The Australian Magpies is available across Australia. The bird prefers to stay on the ground than flying. And they look wonderful when they jump with the small thin legs. So, this is my favourite bird.\n\n4. Slaty Bunting is my preferred bird here in China. The bird is distinctive than the other birds because of its unusual tail. It is available in brown colour and comes in a smaller size. This is a common bird across the country and comes with a few varieties. I love the bird because it helps to keep the environment cleaner. It takes insects and other unwanted invertebrates as diet. So, the environment remains clean. Considering the environmental issue, I love the bird.\n\n5. Asian Koel is the only bird that I love most in my city in India. The bird belongs to the cuckoo family. This is a singing bird and comes with a light black and brown colour. But the male birds are a bit greenish-black. Sometimes the colour appears light brown as well. This is a very common bird in the country and even it has become the symbol of the local poetry. The bird can sing very well and often I wake up with the sweet whistles of the bird near my window. Therefore, Asian Koel has become my favourite bird."

    "Question": "Describe your favourite part of the day (i.e. morning, evening, night etc).",
    "Question__1": "1. I love the early morning hours of the day. After waking up, I practice some yoga this time. The time is completely different from other parts of the day. In fact, this is the beginning of a day and everything seems fresh. I love this part of the day because there are fewer noises around me. I can focus on my yoga without being disturbed.\n\n2. The afternoon is my favourite part of the day. This is the time for my sleep. I take a nap for about half an hour every day. But this is not possible in the college days. The time is different because the sun starts falling. The heat is reduced. I love the part not only for sleep, rather this is the only time when I enjoy movies as well at my home. But the moments become boring when I have to attend college classes.\n\n3. The night is the best time for me. I love the night. In fact, the night is the time when I start working on my projects. By the way, I am a graphic designer and love to work at night times. The night is different from the other parts of the day in all manners. It brings the darkness that has another beauty. The night is my favourite part of a day as it allows me to focus on my work deeply when everyone else is in sleep.\n\n4. Morning hours best suit me for some reasons. I love to read a newspaper with a cup of hot coffee. A morning hour appears fast to me than the other parts of the day. Everyone gets up from the bed and start for their respective duties. This is my favourite part of the day as I feel amazed at how people move to their destinations in the morning hours. Everyone also becomes engaged with their respective tasks in offices or other places. Everything is in harmony during the morning hours.\n\n5. Enjoying a sunset scene is impossible in the other parts of a day. So, I love evening. Usually, I spent my time at the sea beachside here in Sairee Beach in Thailand. Evening attracts me because this is the end of the day. Night falls. And the entire world is covered with darkness. I enjoy the sunset scene and become nostalgic. It reminds me of my past memories. Considering everything, this is the favourite part of the day to me."

    "Question__1": "1. The red squirrel is a small animal which is found in the UK. The squirrel has a distinctive feature – it changes the coat colour in different seasons. This is a common animal across the country and they are found in parks mostly. This is an interesting animal to me because it looks very charming when it changes the colour. Besides, I feel glad when I can catch one of them and feed them fruits.\n\n2. The brown bear is an interesting animal in North America. This is a strong animal and one of the largest carnivorous. The bear has special types of claws that it uses for digging. This is a common animal in this region. To me, it appears as an interesting animal for its brown coat. The brown fur often looks different. And I am amazed at the muscles it owns inside the fur coat.\n\n3. Camel is a wonderful animal. It has several features like it can live without water for a long time, it can run fast than other types of animals. Camel is common in Australia and mostly found in the desert regions. Camels are interesting because they can suit in the desert areas. They can live in a wild environment and do not worry about their habitations.\n\n4. In China, the prevalence of monkey is notable. They are available across the country. Monkeys are popular in negative terms, and many would say they are notorious. They mostly steal foods and other necessaries. They steal foods with a twinkle of an eye. Monkeys appear interesting to me because they can take part in different types of activities. They can imitate humans, take foods like human and even quarrels with each other. All the matters have made monkeys interesting to me.\n\n5. No other animal in Thailand is as popular as the elephant is. They are the largest mammals and has become a part of our culture in the country. An elephant looks great with its giant-like figure. But the eyes are smaller than it was supposed to be with the great physique. Elephants are available across the country and even there are parks for elephants too. Elephants are interesting as they love peace. They do not harm people rather they be like the family members."

It was interesting because I could not think that the ending would be so funny. I laughed for the next few minutes. The joke goes like:\n\nPatient: Doctor, doctor, You've got to help me - I just can't stop my hands shaking!\"\nDoctor: \"Do you drink a lot?\"\nPatient: \"Not really - I spill most of it!\"\n\n2. It was a joke about the president of a country. Samuel told me the joke. It was amusing indeed. The joke made me laugh because it pointed out the silly matters of the president and he was unaware of that. The joke was:\n\nTalented people become Scientists, strong people become Athletes,\nKind people become Philanthropist, brave people become Soldiers, and to both entertain and piss them all, some become presidents.\n\n3.

    "Question__1": "1. I would like to go to the Columbia River Scenic Highway. I would like to have a motorbike drive there. This would be a solo drive. Earlier, I had the experience to visit the area and I went there with my dad. But this time, I would like to have a solo visit there. I also have plans to spend some time near the river bank and enjoy the natural views. But if someone accompanies me, I will lose the flexibilities.\n\n2. The Great Ocean Road in Australia is very beautiful and I want to have a ride there. I would like to make the ride in my car. And I want my girlfriend to be with me there.

A friend showed his interest in the trip and I will ask him. I would like to ride in my car there to enjoy the speed. It is tough to travel inside the city. The traffic congestions have made it nearly impossible to cross the 40s limit. So, I have planned to drive on the expressway and get some different experience.\n\n5. Yaxi Expressway is a wonderful highway in China and I would like to make a trip here. I will prefer my bike during the trip. The highway is excellent to look at so; it is imperative to be with someone during the trip. I would like to be with my younger sister during the trip. The highway comes with ample spaces to get the taste of speed. And since I do not have any car, I will ride on that to make the trip complete."

    "Question": "Describe something important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.",
    "Question__1": "1. I think a healthy lifestyle means to take the right foods to get protein and other necessary food ingredients. I believe by following a balanced diet, one can have a healthy lifestyle. This is important because we cannot live without food. But it should be taken in a limited and balanced way. We need nutrients to get the energy to complete our tasks.\n\n2. A healthy lifestyle is a way of living according to a routine. It appears to me that without following a routine, none can get the proper way of living. This is very important as everything should be balanced. This is important to me because, without a routine, someone cannot get the desired things. There will be a lack of coherence among all the other thing that will make life complex. So, I firmly believe that a routine is necessary to get a healthy lifestyle.\n\n3. Living without stress and tension is the best way to a healthy lifestyle, I think. This is an important aspect to consider to get a healthy lifestyle. Relieving stress is important as it destroys the inner peace of a soul. Unless some are relieved from stress, they are unable to lead a peaceful life. And life with stress is not considered at all as a healthy lifestyle. So, this is highly important to get a healthy lifestyle that someone should try relieving stress from life.\n\n4. It may sound weird to many but I think having the right amount of sleep is the definition of a healthy lifestyle. I believe that without proper sleep, someone is unable to focus on their daily activities. It is important because having a perfect sleep helps people get the necessary energy, complete their tasks efficiently and life becomes easier. Sleeping is also important because it helps to get relaxed and get new energy which people can invest to solve their workplace troubles.\n\n5. A healthy lifestyle means to get the right amount of exercise every day. In fact, every person needs to get exercise in different forms to make them active and remove the laziness. It is important because when someone takes part in the exercise, they need to move their limbs and other organs. Following this way, they become and remain active. Exercise is important for a healthy lifestyle as it keeps people energetic. They can complete the tasks on time and consequently can enjoy their life."

In fact, his thoughts are different from the other sellers of the market. He also knows how to treat people nicely.\n\n5.

But I have plenty of skills and the necessary funding to start it now. This small business owns potentials and guitar servicing will make me closer to the band groups.\n\n5. Search Engine Optimization, also known as SEO is a great job in the present context. I have gathered a pile of experience on the issue. And I am planning to start an SEO service providing business shortly. I have a plan to open it within the next two months. As I was busy with learning and serving at an organization, I could not open it so far. I want to start the business because it would be a leading profession within next few years and the demand for SEO service will increase to a great height due to technological advancement."

    "Question": "Describe a time when the weather condition forced you to change your plan.",
    "Question__1": "1. I changed my plan in the mid of July due to detrimental weather condition. It was a rainy day and it rained heavily the whole day. I had a plan to meet some of my colleagues to discuss an upcoming event. The meeting was set in a local café in Hamburg. After changing the plan, I made phone calls to them. Then we started a virtual meeting. In fact, mt other colleagues had the similar experience like me.\n\n2. Going out in stormy weather is daunting indeed and I never claim myself an adventurous person. So, I had changed my plan. Last month, the weather turned worst and there was a strong storm. It began in the evening and I had the plan to meet some of my friends. The plan was set that we should meet at Jim’s garages, located on the ground floor of his residence in Rush Street in Chicago. Later, the plan was cancelled and I spent time by playing video games.\n\n3. Last Monday, the day was too sunny. In fact, it was a bright day with a clear blue sky. But I had to alter my plans. I wanted to go for capturing some photographs near the Victoria in Australia, but I cancelled the plan eventually. Due to the excessive brightness of the sun, my photos will burn. I actually use my mobile phone for photography and it was not possible to get the right pictures on my device. So, I stayed at home and spent times with my friends on the social networking platform Facebook.\n\n4. Moving for a weekend break in cloudy weather is not wise at all. The weather last weekend was too cloudy and I had to change my plan. I planned to move to a quiet place in Manchester with a couple of my friends. But later, I changed the plan for the weather. In fact, none of my friends wanted to get wet in the sudden rain. So, they came to my place and passed the day by watching movies and playing indoor games.\n\n5. I am afraid of cold weather since my childhood. Last month, I had to change my plan to hang out with my college buddies due to excessive cold outside here in Indonesia. Suddenly the weather changed and ruined my plan to move out. Later, I informed the matter to my friends and they also had similar opinions. So, I spent the rest of the day at home and read books, played video games and enjoyed two movies."

    "Question__1": "1. Visiting a quiet and peaceful pace is my passion and often I visit Lundy Island. This is a nice place to make some solo visits. I prefer to spend the evening hours there. The island is adorned with natural beauties and the sunset scene from the Island is wonderful. So, I like the place. Last time, I took some photographs of the setting sun. I have shared the photos on my social networking profile. Everyone liked the photos.\n\n2. Peaceful places attract me more than any other thing. So, I often visit the Goolwa in South Australia. This is a small town beside the longest river. I usually pass an entire day in the area and take part in various activities. The historic port is an attractive place there while the architecture made of sandstone are adorable indeed. For all the reasons, I like the place so much. Fishing in the river was a great activity last time I visited the place.\n\n3. Finding a quiet place in a busy city like Singapore is really challenging. But the HortPark is a contrast to the hefty and noisy city. Usually, I pass my evening hours in the park. After getting out of my office, I pay a visit there and spend around one or more hours by sitting inside the park. Loneliness inspires me to visit the park. I had completed reading a short novel last time when I went there.\n\n4. Amid hundreds of quiet places in Russia, I prefer the Vyatskoe village. The village is located in the Yaroslavl region and one of the old merchant villages in the country. I pay visits to the village during the weekends and spend the entire day amid festivities. This is a cultural heritage now and the number of museums is notable. I am in love with the place for the modern features in a rural setting. The cinema that I enjoyed last time was appealing.\n\n5. The Nile River is termed as the blood of Egypt. It offers an outstanding view. So, often I pay visits to the river bank. Generally, the best time to visit the river is either in the early morning or in the evening hours. So, there is no exact schedule for me to visit the place. Sometimes, I go there in the moonlit to enjoy the natural beauties. The charming views are the key attraction for me. I took a boat ride the last time when I went there. It was a moonlit night then."

    "Question__1": "1. I will always remember the boat journey I made on the Ganges in India. The journey took us to another ghat (port) which is a few kilometres away from where we started.

The memories are still bright and I can see the bright moon after closing my eyes.\n\n2. The last train journey to Moscow from Saint Petersburg was a wonderful one. I travelled by train and the journey was highly comfortable one. I had to visit Moscow for some official purposes. I attended a couple of meetings on the same day.

Moreover, I had some talks with co-passengers and has spent a good time with them.\n\n3. I could not believe that a business class journey was so comfortable. I made it last month on a local bus. I went to Edinburg from London. It was a solo trip and solely intended to enjoy a bus ride. In fact, I had made a plan long ago to make the journey and completed last weekend. The entire journey was thrilling and filled with joy. I rode on the bus in time and reached at the exact time. I also met some people during the ride who sat beside me on the bus. Overall, it was a memorable journey.\n\n4. I went on a trip with my family in Singapore. It was not a long journey. And we landed in Singapore earlier than we e4xpected. All the family members were present during the journey. We all wanted to have a vacation in Singapore and also meet some relatives there. The journey was memorable as we all had great fun. The entire vacation was filled with joy and delight. I felt sad while returning back to Hong Kong.\n\n5. Group journeys are not always interesting as people of different classes and mentality get together. But I am lucky in that sense. We went to visit Mount Fuji and it was a mixed journey. The group has used different types of vehicles and even walked on feet. I wanted to see the mountain from a close distance and so, I became a part of the group. It was an interesting journey and an advantageous experience for me."

Playing chess is difficult and the complexity level rises when the player is a newbie. A similar thing happened to me. I took part in an inter-class chess competition at my college in Melbourne.

They actually instigated me and however, it was a tough experience.\n\n4. If you have skills, you can be a winner in table tennis. But if you are a newbie, chances are little to win the game. And it was a failure for me. I was the later one. I lost in the game that took place in my college in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. The winners were awarded different types of prizes like certificates and small gifts. Just to check my skills and how my physical fitness is, I enrolled in the competition.\n\n5. I was never fond of basketball and got an altering view about the game after I took part in. In fact, I did not have the slightest idea how to play it and I just enjoyed the matches. But last month, I had to take part in a basketball match as part of my college team. Luckily, my team became the best one in Hokkaido, Japan, for outstanding performance. Just to meet the curiosity and with direct inspiration from my surrounding students and teachers, I took part in the competition."

Besides, it was made of a nice design and I also loved the olive colour. Therefore, it was an important present for me.\n\n5. It was a memorable event for me when I received a T-shirt from a friend on the last day of my college. Danny gave me the T-shirt in November last year. It was the rag day of the college and we were having the last party in our college. I know that the T-shirt was not too much pricy but it was filled with emotion. I realized that the T-shirt is the representation of the love and caring Danny had for me in his heart. So, it was an important gift for me."

Many of them were injured and taken to the hospital. It was really depressing.\n\n4. The disorder between two groups of workers in Sri Lanka was a concerning issue. I came to know about the issue immediately it took place in the manufacturing plant I work in. Suddenly, I heard some louder noise from the ground floor of the manufacturing plant. I was concerned about the matter. Some of the workers were injured in the clash and I had to inform the local police station about the issue. The situation was normalized after roughly four hours.\n\n5. A riot took place between two groups of tourists at a spot here in Greece. This was a completely unwanted event. I witnessed the event on the evening of the last Monday. The trouble began with a minor issue. A tourist wanted to get the ticket and broke the queue. It sparked the matter and some other people protested it. The violence began. The supporters of the violators got involved in a scuffle and it was a sad event and one of them was seriously injured."

Watson, my college friend, informed me of the issues that I achieved the first position in the last semester's exam. Watson came to my home to inform me about it.

    "Question__1": "1. The invention of the airplane is one of the greatest ones in world history. It was the invention of the Wright Brothers. Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright first generated the idea of the airplane and had some experiments that made them later successful to make the very first airplane in the world. This is a very useful mode of faster travel in the present age. It has removed the distance. This is also beneficial for me. I fly to different countries from Singapore for my business purposes.\n\n2. Facebook is a social networking site and now is used by billions of people across the world. This is in fact hard to find someone without a Facebook account at the present age. Mark Zuckerberg invented the platform and it was officially launched in 2004.

I cannot pass a single day without browsing this website.\n\n3. The virtual keyboard is one of the greatest inventions of this present age. This is used for different purposes.

The users can type using the keyboard and also can deliver commands to devices and computers. I used a virtual keyboard recently and liked that for its portability. It is also secured as data entered through a virtual keyboard could not be easily tracked via tracking software.\n\n4. Google Glass is an important technological invention that helps to get things before an eye. The tech giant Google Inc. invented this in 2013 and now this is available in different versions. This is a very useful device for many professionals including doctors. In a word, a digital device is made in the shape of a glass. The users do not need to hold the display in their hands. The can see the things they want right before the eyes. I had the chance to get in touch with a Google glass and I found it very useful for me.\n\n5. Hybrid cars are kind of the latest invention in the world. They run on both system – fuel and solar. I actually cannot remember who invented this technology but seen one in a car exhibition held in the USA. The hybrid cars are of great use to people. At present, people need to spend a good amount of money on fuel and if the massive production of hybrid cars begins, they will save energy and money. Moreover, it would save the environment too. I would love to use such a car. Usually, I feel worried about fuel and there would be no such troubles at all."

It helps me to express my sudden feelings. In fact, I am not a skilled blogger and use this just to share what I think.\n\n6. Linkedin is a wonderful social networking site. I mostly use the site to know about jobs and other purposes. The website is mostly used by professionals of different working sectors. They post jobs and offers for others. Honestly, I have got my current job using this website. I had been seeking a job for me near Sydney and got this one after knowing about it from the website."

    "Question": "Describe a common dress that females in your country wear.",
    "Question__1": "1. The short coat is a common dress for females in the UK. It comes with a single piece of coat that covers through the hip. It looks special when a woman wears it and also makes her look attractive. This is not common in other countries. I like the dress so much for some reasons. The fabric used in the dress is comfortable and it is easily washable.\n\n2. The leather jacket is the usual dress for women in the USA. They mostly use it during working hours. The jacket looks great and could be used either with pants or any formal wears. The jacket is also available in other parts of the world. Obviously, I like jackets. They come in different styles and size, and the prices are reasonable too. One can easily get them.\n\n3. In Russia, traditionally women wear sarafan. This is a kind of jumper costume for women and girls. The dress is available in different colour and shape. But this is not available out of the country. I do not like the dress for some reasons. After wearing it, I feel my movements are blocked. In fact, I do not have enough space inside the dress to move my limbs.\n\n4. Long sleeve shirts are common for women in Malaysia. They wear a shirt for various purposes. The shirt often comes with no pockets and are tucked in with formal pants. Sometimes, women wear it in a casual environment too. Such types of shirts are common in other countries too. I love the shirts because they are comfortable to wear. Besides, cleaning is not trouble here.\n\n5. Majority of the women in India wear saree. This is long unstitched clothing and needs special skills to wear on. Saree is common in some other Asian countries. But I cannot prefer saree for some reasons. In fact, I am unable to maintain the heavy length of saree and wearing it appears troublesome to me. Moreover, I always need to be cautious after wearing saree. So, I do not prefer it.\n\n6. Kimono is a traditional and formal wear for women in Japan. This is a long robe-like dress with several layers. It looks beautiful when a woman wears it. Usually, kimono is not available in other countries because of its complex wearing styles. Honestly speaking, I cannot prefer this dress for some reasons. I do not feel comfortable with it and my movement becomes limited.\n\n7. Women in Saudi Arabia use Abaya and Shayla as their traditional dress, and obviously, they come in black colour. Abaya is an outer cloak while Shayla plays the role of a scarf. The dress is common in some other UAE countries too. I love to wear this dress for some particular reasons. It helps to protect us from the sun heat and also helps to cover my head and hair."

    "Question": "Describe a TV series which you enjoy watching.",
    "Question__1": "1. The walking dead is my favourite television show. It is aired based on series. And this is all about zombies and apocalyptic events. A notable number of people have starred in the series. It began on a local USA TV channel in 2010 and a new session is yet to come. I love the show for some reasons. The show reminds me of such a situation when humans will struggle to live on and protect themselves from zombies. All the moments are thrilling and so I enjoy it.\n\n2. CID is the longest-running television series in India and I like it most. The TV series is about investigating different types of crime by Mumbai police. The series is starred by Shivaji Satam, Dayanand Shetty, Aditya Srivastav, Dinesh Phadnis and Narendra Gupta among others in different roles. The series is aired on Sony Television on a weekly basis. I enjoy the show because of its plot, scripts, and performance of the artists.\n\n3. Eternal Love is a Chinese television show. It is also known by other names like – Three Lives Three Worlds. The show is based on the novel of the same name. The plot is a combination of several aspects of the love of human and goddess, fighting ghosts and their powers etc. It is starred by Yang Mi and Mark Chao while there are many other supporting roles. The series is broadcast on a daily basis in some local and international channels. I love the suspense of the events and wait to know the consequences.\n\n4. In Japan, Trigun was a popular anime television series and I used to watch it. The series was about bounty hunters who had been seeking a person to kill but the person had no idea what he did. There are several characters that lead the series to a conclusion. It was aired on a regular basis on a local television channel in Tokyo (I actually forgot the tv station name). I enjoyed the series because it had the flavour of western movies made in Hollywood.\n\n5. Babylon Berlin is newly aired television drama series in Germany. The series is about the transfer of a police inspector into the capital in the setting of 1920. The series is starred by Volker Bruch, Liv Lisa Fries, Leonie Benesch, Peter Kurth among others in different roles. The series has been premiered in October of 2017.

    "Question": "Describe something you did that made you feel proud of yourself.",
    "Question__1": "1. Drinking alcohol was a very bad habit of mine and I recently have given it up. I quit drinking alcohol from the last summer. I feel proud of cutting the habit from my life for some reasons. I got drunk and behaved unnaturally sometimes. Now, I can lead a healthier life after getting rid of the attitude. I felt a sense of happiness inside my mind. It was a wonderful perception.\n\n2. I got a job that I love. And I had to undergo different situations before getting the job. I started working for this travelling company headquartered in Moscow from October of last year. It was a dream job for me. I wanted a job that will allow me to travel in different national and international places. So, I felt very excited when I got the job. In fact, I trusted the skills that make me feel proud.\n\n3. Though this is not an important matter to my parents, I made an anniversary cake for them marking their 23rd anniversary. I presented the cake at the beginning of their anniversary and they were surprised indeed. I felt proud of myself because not every child is like me. Many of them do not care for their parents at all. So, I felt extreme happiness. I felt satisfied and when they smiled at me, it was my biggest gift I got ever.\n\n4. Often teachers become troublemakers. So, once I raised my voice against one of such troublemaking teachers. I did it just before the beginning of the final semester at my university (University of Tokyo). I protested against the unnecessary workloads given by the teacher. He used to provide lots of assignments and tasks for home. I felt proud when some other students also rose their voice against the teacher’s decision.\n\n5. Helping others selflessly is great quality and I help people in this way. Recently, I helped an old woman to get down using the staircase. I live in an apartment block in Paris and due to some technical problems, the elevator was closed. I felt proud of helping the woman because no other people came to her help. I felt glad. I am different from other people. It made a special sense inside me.\n\n6. I am proud of my real-life skills. I can survive in almost any situations. In last summer, I got unemployed and had no money with me. But using my real-life skills and communication capacities, I have got a new job – better than the former one. So, I feel proud of myself. It was a risky period for me. The struggle involved some other family members of mine. Honestly, I was afraid. But once the period was over, I felt relieved."

    "Question__1": "1. Buckingham Palace is a great one to visit in England. This is the residence of the monarch of the country and also the administrative headquarters. The palace is located in Westminster. I came to know about it from the general knowledge book. To visit the place, I have to collect my passport and visa for England. Besides, I also may need permissions to enter the palace. This is a nice place and related to numerous history. So, I would love visiting there.  \n\n2. Darwin is a wonderful place in Australia. The coastline of the city looks wonderful. The sandy sea beach is always filled with the crowd. I was browsing a website to know about beautiful places in Australia and it appeared before me. Australia is far away from my own land. I live in South Africa. So, I will need to arrange for many things to make it come true. I want to visit the place to enjoy the beauties of the country.\n\n3. The Red Fort is located in Delhi and a historical place as well. The fort has been used as the residence of Mughal emperors in their regime. An Indian friend of mine told me about the establishment. Visiting the fort is not easy. At first, I have to go to Delhi from New York City. Then I will need my friend’s help to reach the fort. So far, I heard that it was a historical place and different attractive relics are there. So, I would love to go there.\n\n4. South Korea has some special things to explore and the N Seoul Tower is one of them. Officially the tower is known as the YTN Seoul Tower. The Seoul Tower is the second-highest point in the country. A recent article about the tower informed me of all the information. Visiting the country is a bit troublesome for me from Britain. But I have a plan to go there somehow. This is a very attractive place and a perfect position for observation. So, I want to go there.\n\n5. Neelum Valley in Pakistan is a wonderful place to visit around the year. The place is under the Azad Kashmir area – on the opposite of India occupied Kashmir. The valley is around 240 kilometres in length. This is beautiful land indeed and the entire locality is a blue gem in a practical sense. After reading an article on Kashmir, I came to know about the area. Managing visa for Pakistan would be hard for me. I have seen some photos and they were magnificent. So, I would like to go there."

    "Question__1": "1. I would like to be a renowned chef. In fact, I love to cook and have a small restaurant in Madrid. This is a lengthy process and will involve different things. First of all, I need to take some academic degrees about nutrition and cuisine of other countries. I am planning to get admitted at the end of this year. I also have talked with a chef of an international restaurant. It would help me to cook nutritious and delicious food and I would remain healthy.\n\n2. Since my childhood, I have been dreaming to become an aeroplane pilot. But this requires some specific rules and regulations to follow. I have to take academic degrees in aeronautics. Besides, I also will need to get trained in piloting an aeroplane. I will start the training soon and already been trying to get admitted to a university in Germany where aeronautics is taught. It would be good for me for many reasons, and importantly my mental health would boost up.\n\n3. Travelling is my hobby and I have a plan to complete visiting my own land, Russia. This is a large country with lots of places to visit. It would require ample leisure hours to complete the travel. Moreover, I will also need money to bear all the expenses. I have a plan to take a break from all my activities next year and will begin the trip in the first week of February. Of course, it would be beneficial for me. I will learn numerous real-life issues from the trip. Besides, travelling will help me to get fresh air and foods that would keep me healthy.\n\n4. Population in India is enough but most of them are not literate or lack civic sense. So, I am planning to become a social worker in future. Becoming a social worker needs some specific skills. Firstly, I have to grow my inter-personal communication skills so that I could make people aware of any issues. I am planning to do it after completing my academic studies. Definitely, it would be a great task for me. When I will inform people about health, I will also follow them to maintain good health. \n\n5. A library is the storehouse of knowledge. So, I would like to make a library of my own. This is a hefty task and requires lots of stages to complete. As the first step, I have to collect a remarkable number of books for the library. I have already started collecting books. Sometimes, I buy books while some of my friends also donate me. I want it to complete by next year. If the library is completed, it would be beneficial for my mental faculty. In fact, reading books help me alleviate my mood. And when I am in a good mood, I can take care of my health."

    "Question": "Describe a story about space (real or fictitious) that you have read about or seen in a film or on TV.",
    "Question__1": "1. Recently I have enjoyed a movie made about space. In the afternoon of last weekend, I enjoyed the movie. The plot was about the communication of an alien with a human and they gradually fell in love. I think the story is not significant today but it may happen so after a few more years if the existence of aliens could be proved. But I felt interesting after watching the movie. The ending made me emotional.\n\n2. I read a book about the existence of aliens. It was a fiction and the plot aimed to entertain the readers. Some aliens came into the earth and took the shape of humans. But they had some extraordinary skills. And they saved some lives from a disaster. I think the story might be significant in the present context. In fact, we need support from external sources to remain alive amid unstable situations across the world. I enjoyed the story on the last page.\n\n3. I read the story in a newspaper on Monday last. It was a nice story that dealt with an outer space matter. The story was about hearing some weird noise in the moon during a lunar orbit. In 1969, Apollo 10 was sent to the moon and the astronauts heard some whistling types of music. Even the sound is recorded too. The story is significant today. It will help to discover the existence of life in the outer space. The story amazed me greatly.\n\n4. The book – Two Sides of the Moon was interesting. I had read the book in the last summer vacation in Paris. Landing on earth from space often becomes difficult for technical reasons. The author experienced such an issue and landed in a deserted place. Survival was troublesome for him and his crewmate. The story bears great significance. Repairing the potential technical errors is the best way to deal with it. I was thrilled reading the experiences of the author.\n\n5. I read a story about the troubles of space travelling. I read it during a journey by bus inside a German city. The story was science fiction. A small boy went to a spacewalk and met with some space giants. They chased the boy and he survived using his ready wits and smartness. I think such stories do not have any significance today but the days are not so far when a majority of the people will travel in space. I enjoyed the story and liked the smartness of the boy to get rid of troubles.\n\n6. The storyline of the movie amazed me. I enjoyed the movie at a theatre complex in Japan on Last Saturday. The movie was about the love of two aliens and they descended on the planet for survival from their own species.  But I believe such stories are worth to enjoy they will not take place in real life. However, the emotional movie plot entertained me to the fullest."

    "Question__1": "1. Before having a positive mindset, I could not get success in anything. So, I changed my point of view. I tried to look everything in a general perspective. I changed my mindset a few days ago after attending a counselling session. But I had to face numerous difficulties. In the beginning, I could not accept the changes. Everything is fine with me now and I am happy by changing my outlook.\n\n2. I was physically less fit and got admitted to a health club here in Barcelona to regain my health. I got included on the health club list around six months ago. It was hard for me to maintain the hard and fast rules of health. I had to give up smoking, take nutritious foods and obviously had to exercise. Now I am feeling better and enjoying good health indeed.\n\n3. Intervening in family issues was not my cup of tea but I had to interfere with some matters. The issues appeared at the beginning of this year and I entered my nose to get the right solution. I had to experience enmity form my siblings and even my parents were against me in some aspects. But finally, I was able to hold everyone’s attention and everyone followed my suggestions. The problem was solved. I was too happy.\n\n4. Getting on the right track for me was difficult in a populous city like Shanghai. But I was determined and established my own business here. I established the café following my native style about one year ago. In the beginning, I had many competitors. Beating them with the quality of foods and price was a challenge for me. But I am successful now and my perseverance brought me success. I am really glad.\n\n5. Climbing was hard for me unless I reached the top of a hill here in Greece. I climbed on the top last month. It was a real adventure. I had serious troubles in the first phase. I broke my leg and also got injured by falling down several times. Luckily, I did not fall from a great height. But all the sufferings were gone when I reached the top of the large hill. It appeared that I won the world.\n\n6. Saving money is difficult if you have uncountable sources to spend. So, I made a plan to save some money every month. I made the plan about one year ago. And now I am amazed at the result. But I had to experience some issues. Cutting down costs is highly difficult and I also compromised with numerous matters. But all of my compromises resulted in success. I have a smart amount of money in my bank account and I am planning to invest in any suitable sector."

    "Question__1": "1. Two months ago I went to watch a tennis championship match. The match was held at Wimbledon in London. And the match started in the afternoon.

So, I took my seat near the ground and enjoyed the match to the last minute.\n\n2. Golf appears a slow type of sport but I went to watch a golf match recently. The game was held at Sand Hills Golf Club in Nebraska. The game began at around 10.30 am. It was a memorable experience for me for a few reasons. It was quite an exciting game. In fact, I started supporting a player subconsciously and he won at last. I enjoyed the game completely but standing aside from the ground, I felt a bit uncomfortable.\n\n3. My recent participation in an inter-class cricket match was exciting. The cricket match took place on my college ground (Lahore college in Pakistan). I performed better in this match and won it. But it was extremely difficult to beat the opponent team. The event is memorable for many reasons. I took two wickets. Actually, I was the best performer who took wickets almost giving no runs to the batsmen.\n\n4. Recently I have got a yellow belt and won a martial art competition. The event was held in Budokan in Tokyo. It began in the evening. The event is memorable for me because of my awards. I had to beat three opponents against me. I had to apply all the skills I gained so far. Besides, I also fought without rules that I have seen in action movies. Overall, it was a nice experience for me.\n\n5. Volleyball is a popular sport for women in China, and I took part in it last month. The competition took place at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing. The entire event is memorable to me on some grounds. My team lost the match and it was a sad event for us all. I tried to make some scores by defeating the opponents. But they were too much skilled than us and we had to lose.\n\n6. Germans love to play football and often there are football matches between various national and international teams. Recently I went to enjoy a live match between two domestic teams at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. The event was memorable. The team I supported scored three goals while the opponent had only a single goal. I shouted throughout the entire game. I also wore a jersey resembling my supporting team."

    "Question__1": "1. The Black Death that occurred in the Mid-14th century was a historical event for London. Due to the outbreak of this disease, a good number of people died.

People turned back to religion with some new inspirations.\n\n2. The event of September 11 in 2001 was one of the most historically important events in the USA. On this day, some so-called Islamic extremists destroyed the World Trade Center – an American landmark. Some people were brainwashed by Osama Bin Laden and conducted a deliberate attack to cause damage to the USA. It was the beginning of a new history in the USA and the War on Terror begin from that day.\n\n3. The Battle of Plassey took place in 1757. It was the beginning of colonialization in India and surrounding areas. By bribing Mir Jafar Ali Khan, an associate of Siraj Ud-Daulah, the British East Indian company won the battle. Siraj Ud-Daulah was the last independent Nawab of the country and after his fall, the British regime began in this subcontinent. The event was important in some aspects. Settlements from different other places were done based on trade and other purposes.\n\n4. The year 1964 is an important year for Canada. On this year, the country received its own flag. Before this year, Canada had to use the Union Jack. The legislative body of the country is largely commendable for this purpose. In fact, a flag helps to represent sovereignty and the country did not have that. So, it was an important event on December 15 in 1964 when the Canadian flag was hoisted. The maple leaf was picked after different options.\n\n5. Independence of Japan was one of the important events in the country’s history. Before independence, Japan was under the USA authority. The USA emancipated Japan on January 1 in 1952 and declared it as an independent country. The inner movements for independence played an important role in this case. Now, we are an independent nation and have ample options for development.\n\n6. The revolution of China in 1911 was an important event in the country’s history. It was termed as the Chinese Bourgeois Democratic Revolution and played a great role in the fall of the Qing Dynasty. The revolution also ended the feudalist society in China which was around 2000-year-old. The revolution was led by Dr Sun Yat-sen. This was an important event because it helped to create a new society in China."

She helped me in bathing, getting prepared for school etc. But I enjoyed playing in the school ground most. We played various types of outdoor sports there.    \n\n5. Admission at a boarding school is tough but spending the entire childhood there is extremely undesirable. I spent my childhood with my teachers and friends. I had to take regular meals provided by the school authority. The school was located in the southwest corner of Jakarta – far away from my residence. So, the attendants from the school took care of mine. But bunking the classes was highly thrilling to me.\n\n6. My parents were with me in my childhood. In fact, I was their only daughter and they loved me much. I loved taking foods made from vegetables and still, the habit is on. In day times, mom used to take care of me and even accompanied me to school. I enjoyed different things in my childhood and reading comic books was the most notable one.
