    "Answer": "I am never really a kind of person who likes to admire other persons (well, for a girl, I am a rather “free-spirited” person) even when they should be. But, when it comes to my elder sister, I can’t help admiring her even on her worst days.\n\nMy sister is about 5 years older than me, and since my childhood, she is the person who looked after me in the absence of my parents (they were both working parents). I can still vividly remember those days when I was allowed to play outside with my friends, and I didn’t want to return home, but it was my elder sister who had pulled me up with her two hands and pretty much “snatched” me from the playground. I can also remember those special times when my elder sister kept playing cartoon movies one after another until I actually chose the one which I decided to watch in the end. My elder sister and I loved baking chocolate cake together, and this memory goes back to those days when I had just probably learned to write a full sentence and draw an elephant without any help. Anyway, I don’t really see my elder sister now because we both have different work and school schedules these days.\n\nI really admire my sister mainly because she is a truly loving and patient person for her age. In fact, in my 25 years of life, I have never seen my elder sister get mad at me even though I have done plenty of things to annoy her. As an elder sister, she knew her role perfectly well in the absence of our parents as I remember her cooking for me and feeding me even during the days when she fell sick. Finally, I admire my elder sister because of her sheer determination which made her study for a PhD degree at night after having a full-time job during the day time."

    "Answer": "I have got a nuclear family that has only five members. All of us love each other very much and we share a strong bond and affection. It's quite hard to pick someone among them I admire the most. Well, if I have to choose someone, it would be my mother. I would like to thank you for this nice topic and for the time you have allowed me to talk about the person in my family I admire deeply.\n\nI love my mother from the deepest core of my heart. I revere my mother for her adorable behaviour on top of her smartness and loving nature. She is the person I can share everything with and that's the reason I worship her so much. She is perky, charismatic, optimistic and the ray of sunshine in my life.\n\nPossibly she is the first person I saw when I opened my eyes to this world. Someone's relationship with his or her mother is divine. I can still remember a childhood day when I was late to return home due to a programme at the school I did not know about. After an hour or so, I noticed my mother at my school. I was horrified that my mother would be angry with me and she would punish me. But, when my mother saw me, she had a warm smile on her face. Then she hugged me passionately. At that very moment, I realised how much she loves me and cares for my safety and wellbeing.\n\nTo describe her more, I would say she is kind to all in a unique way and yet proactive and in control. She loves cooking, decorating homes with innovative ideas, helping others and reading. O. Henry is her favourite writer. She hates speed driving and liars, you know what I mean!\n\nI spent my 19 years or so with my parents but I now stay in a metropolitan city for my higher education. Whenever I get a vacation, I visit my family. On an average, I spend 2/3 months in a year with my family, hence with my mother as well. But I talk to her over the phone almost every day.\n\nThe reason I admire her, well - she is caring, compassionate, and possesses kindness and love for everyone. She is an ideal mother who raised three children and ensured their quality education and moral values. She has sacrificed a lot and had never complained about anything to us. She is the person who reminds me of the power of love and affection. How could not I admire her unconditionally?"

    "Answer": "A person I admire is my “mother” because she is a fighter. You may ask why? To start, my mom got pregnant with me at the age of 18 and she did not have the support of my grandparents. Her own parents wanted to kick her out of the house when they found out. She convinced them to let her stay, but she could not ask them for any help when raising the baby. Knowing all this my mom still decided to have the baby - and that's baby is me. How could I not adore her with my every breath!\n\nBesides not having the support of her parents, she did not receive any help from my father either. Although my father cared about me, he never gave my mom money or clothes to help her maintain me as a baby. She had to provide for me on her own. Going to school and working was killing her, but she wanted me to have a good life, so she did anything that she could. My mom got pregnant again two years later, with the same man. The only difference was this time - it was worse! He abandoned her completely and her dad was sick. Now, not only did she have to provide for her two babies, but also for her parents. She was overwhelmed by everything happening; she didn't know what to do.\n\nFinally, she decided to attend a college and become a teacher to support the family. It was not an easy thing to do. After she finished college, it took her a while to find a job. It is not easy to find a job in Nicaragua. However, my mom never quits, no matter how hard things get for her she fought through it. To provide for her offsprings and parents. I see her every single day and I wish to be with her for the rest of my life. I have never seen anyone so determined and caring and she deserved to be admired and loved."

    "Answer": "I have got six family members and all of them are very dear and close to me. If I have to pick a family member I genuinely admire that would be my father. My father’s name is Alfred Brooke and he is approximately 50 years old. He is the kind of person I would want my offspring to be. Thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about my father.\n\nHe did his graduation at a time when formal education was not people’s first choice. They would rather start working rather than going to school. My father fought for his right to education with people who thought working or doing some sort of business has more advantages than going to schools. But my father believed that education shapes a man’s life and is a power that would guide him throughout life.\n\nI have numerous memories of my father and I see him every day now. We share a strong bond and have mutual respect for each other. I still remember my childhood days when I used to wait in the evening for my father to return from his office. He would then play with me and help me complete my homework. I vividly remember the times when he took me to the market and bought me gifts. When I was an infant he moved to a city from our village to ensure better schooling for me. That was a decision that has changed my life path. He helped me finish my lessons and often surprised me with gifts if I could complete my study on time and I cherish these days very much.\n\nHe used to work in a Government organisation and for his devotion to work and kindness, he is revered by all of his relatives, friends and neighbours. He is humble yet dynamic, charismatic, and very social.\n\nHe believes in humanity, in God and the afterlife, good behaviour, and leads a life that can be exemplary for many. He still does most of his works himself and helps my mom with her household tasks. After retirement, he has picked up two new hobbies- gardening and teaching young children. He is a quiet and intelligent man who has a benevolent heart and that's something that makes him so admirable to me. He is still the pillar of our family and all of our family members love and respect him very much."

    "Answer": "Moving to New Delhi from a small town because of the job, of course, has its disadvantages. But, it has some benefits as well, and one such benefit is that you have many, literally countless number of great restaurants to try your favourite food. Today, I would like to talk about one such restaurant which has been my favourite since the day I moved to the capital of my country.\n\nThe name of the restaurant is “Bukhara” which is located in the diplomatic enclave of New Delhi. This high-end fine dining restaurant has an extravagant ambience and stylish aura which reflects the modernity and glamorous style of “Indian Royalty”. The interior wall of this famous, all-Indian restaurant is made of expensive tiles with perfect lighting scheme to illuminate them. The tables are not placed too close to each other either in order to ensure the privacy of the customers. The plates and cutleries look exceptionally good and elegant which perfectly blends in with the royal interior of the restaurant. And, as for the foods, the celebrated restaurant serves authentic Mughlai foods such as Murgh Tandoori, Tandoori Guchchi, sumptuous Mutton Biryani, Chaamp Taajdar (mutton chops braised and grilled), authentic Butter Chicken and Daal along with Malai tikka and Raarhya Meat which are served with crisp Rotis and Ulta Tawa parathas. It also serves \"Sarson da saag\" and \"Makki di roti”. Finally, Dal Bukhara, served with the Tandoori Naan, Kastoori kebab, Reshmi kebab would also satisfy your taste-buds anytime.  \n\nIt is my favourite restaurant mainly because they always serve fresh food with the best ingredients available in the market. Besides, whenever I come to this restaurant, the staffs always treat me like a “royal” with a very friendly attitude. I love this restaurant also because it always serves the foods at the right time, after ordering for them, without keeping me waiting and hungry. Finally, this is my favourite restaurant also because it perfectly blends the taste of different kinds of Indian cuisines from different parts of India."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to talk about my favourite restaurant. The name of my favourite restaurant is Diner's Paradise and it is located in the downtown of the city I live in. I like it because it offers a nice environment and delicious food. Moreover, I have many pleasant memories related to this establishment. My parents celebrated some of my birthday parties there, our college friends arranged get-together parties twice, and in one occasion, one of my cousins’ marriage ceremony was celebrated at that very place; and all these events make it special to me.\n\nThe restaurant has three floors and the sitting arrangement is extraordinary which does not compromise privacy, unlike many other restaurants. Paintings of famous artists hang on the wall and the place is clean. The interior decoration is simply gorgeous. Besides, the ground floor can park more than 50 cars. It also has a large playground for children. Finally, the front view of the restaurant is unique as it gives the aura of a green and lavish garden.\n\nThe restaurant offers several dishes including continental menus, Italian, Thai, Indian, Pakistani and local menus along with the delightful exotic desserts. Not to mention, the prices are reasonable and the food is served reasonably quickly, contrary to some other eateries where you have to wait for a long for your food to be served. Besides, the attendants and other staff members are friendly and they treat the guests cordially. The restaurant offers a wide range of dishes to pick from and no additional service charge is imposed on the final bill. The soft background music and instrumentals make the environment more enjoyable and soothing. As I have said, tables are not congested and people can enjoy their personal conversations and enjoy sports on large TVs. The large glass-made windows offer the city view which makes the place worth visiting. The place is famous for dining and I have often noticed many foreign tourists visiting the restaurant. It's a good thing that the authority invites customer feedback and comments on food, service and dining experience and they take prompt actions against customer complaints.\n\nI would say, this is a really nice restaurant to go to and enjoy the tasty food and I like it very much."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this nice topic. I would like to talk about my favourite restaurant and mention where it is, what it looks like, the kinds of food it serves and why it is so special to me.\n\nMy favourite restaurant is in England! It is actually in the suburbs of the city of Sheffield where I live in. The restaurant is on a busy street very near to a large park. It is quite a small and hectic place called Jonty’s because Jonty is the name of the person who set up the business.\n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant doesn’t look very impressive. It has large glass windows at the front and some benches outside for people to sit on if they are waiting to go in. There used to be a large sign with the name of the restaurant written on it in big letters, but recently they have taken down the sign and not yet replaced it! Inside there are lots of square wooden tables, each with about four chairs around them. The restaurant is on two levels, I prefer to go upstairs to the first floor because there you can sometimes get a window seat and enjoy watching people as they go past in the street outside.\n\nThe restaurant serves mainly breakfast and lunch meals. It does really good coffee – I like their latte’s best – and lots of sandwiches, salads and special soups. The restaurant also has a selection of delicious, gooey homemade cakes. However, when I go, I always have the same thing – scrambled egg on wholemeal toast with mushrooms, because that is what I like best!\n\nThe restaurant is very special to me and my friends because we meet there every Saturday. On Saturday’s about 500 people go to the local park for 9.00 in the morning to take part in a 5 km run. Afterwards, I like to go to breakfast at Jonty’s with three of my best friends. We feel we deserve a big breakfast after our run, and we enjoy catching up with each other’s news over a leisurely meal together.\n\nSo if ever you are in Sheffield, I hope you will find Jonty’s and enjoy it as much as I do."

    "Answer": "Dine Excellence' is the largest restaurant in our city and this is my favourite eatery in my area. This place offers a great dining experience and the view, both inside and outside, is spectacular. This is a beautiful restaurant with a great price and a clean environment. I often go there to enjoy my meal with my wife and on some occasions, with my friends.\n\nIt is a four-storied restaurant and the 2nd floor is reserved for parties and special events. The playground for children is large enough and a good number of toys are placed there for children to have fun. The roof-top is my personal favourite as it gives a very clear view of the surrounding nature and the clear blue sky. If it is not raining, I like to enjoy my dinner at the roof-top. The interior decoration of the restaurant is something that makes it stand out from the crowd. The soft music, delicious dishes and well-mannered and prompt staffs make it a worth visiting place for food lovers.\n\nThe variety of dishes this restaurant offers is another great thing about it. Someone will find almost any local or famous foreign menu there and the master cooks make the food tasty and worth enjoying. Interestingly, the price of the food in this restaurant is comparatively cheaper and that's the main reason I love this restaurant so much - it is indeed pocket-friendly.  Many other restaurants in my city offer delightful dishes and good services, but most of them are expensive.\n\nThe weekly music concert and discount for regular customers are two other reasons I prefer it more than other restaurants. I was very surprised to get as high as 30-35% discount on a few occasions and they told me that this was their way of rewarding loyal customers. I would recommend anyone in this city to enjoy the delicious menu this restaurant offers and I am sure most of them would love the experience."

    "Answer": "People say that if we read books, it will make us smart, and if we read too much of it, we will become “bookworm”. Not sure, if I am smart or a bookworm, but I do love to read books once in a while if they are a good read. Today, I would like to talk about one such book called “The Alchemist”, a novel, written by a Brazilian writer named “Paulo Coelho”. \"The Alchemist\", is said by many, continues to change the lives of its readers forever. This book has established itself as a modern classic, universally admired and loved by people.\n\nI heard about the book for the first time during my university years when one of my university friends was doing some research on the Islamic heritage of Andalusia, which was ruled by my the Muslim rulers from 8th century to 14th century, in order to write an essay on it. The book aroused a huge interest in me as I couldn’t possibly find a reason as to why a Brazilian Author would care to write an allegory of someone, who was “supposedly” living in an area called “Andalusia” in Spain which was/is about 8000 kilometres away from Brazil.\n\nAnyway, the book is essentially a third-person narration which tells about the story of a young shepherd boy (Santiago) from Andalusia who dreams to travel around the whole world. However, his greatest incident in life was to meet a Melchizedek, King of Salem, who directs him towards his journey from the Andalusian plains to the exotic markets of Tangier and through the mighty deserts Sahara to the Al-Fayoum oasis where he encounters the “Alchemist” as well as meets a girl called “Fatima” and falls in love with her. \n\nThe book is full of lessons which are bound to influence you one way or another. I learnt that life gives us choices, and chances if we are willing to take them and there is nothing called an impossible dream. Anyway, after reading this book, I understood that fear seems to be the biggest obstacle in achieving our dreams than the “obstacle” itself if any. After reading this book, my belief was re-affirmed once again that truth prevails always no matter how hard we try to hide it. I also realized that we should always try to live in our present if we really want to be happy in life."

    "Answer": "Whenever I get time, I try to read books and this is a hobby I immensely enjoy. The types of books I read greatly vary from skill development books to technical one, sometimes religious, other time fictions, classic and contemporary books. The book I would like to describe for this topic is a novel titled ‘Kane and Abel’ by the famous British writer Jeffrey Archer.\n\nSometimes I read book reviews on the Internet before I start reading a book. I found that most of the Jeffrey Archer fans have recommended the book ‘Kane & Abel’. Some even commented that this is the best book ever by the same author. I made my mind at this very moment to read this book soon. After a week or so, I purchased the book from a bookstore and started reading it.\n\nThe book was first published in 1979 in the United Kingdom and in the USA in 1980. The book was the international success and reached number 1 position on the New York Times best-selling book list. The storyline started with the birth of two infants named Kane and Abel in the year 1906. On different sides of the planet, they grew up: one shaped by a luxurious upbringing, fine schooling and history he read, the other one who lost his mother at the time of his birth and did not know who his father was, well-tempered by war, slavery and history he was part of. The storytelling of Jeffrey Archer was enchanting. Every page I turned tempted me to read further. Not for a single moment, I could have stopped thinking about the events and characters of the books and that had a major influence on me. The characters have their own charismatic powers and followed their own paths. One is gold, meritorious while the other one is steel and have forfeited the Dead himself. On their journey in life, they confront each other and became the ultimate adversary of each other. In their relentless battle, both men knew that there could be only one victor- and one vanquished.\n\nAcross three generations and around a rapidly changing world, their war rages unchecked, for the love of a dream, the loss of an empire, and the lure of a fortune. Kane became the owner of the largest bank in the USA while Abel came to the USA as a penniless emigrant after the World War I. With intelligence Kane started flourishing the banking business, while Abel made his fortune at last in Hotel business. The first time they confronted each other as a bank owner and a debtor. Though Kane wanted to help Abel regain his business by financing further, but could not do so because of the bank’s board members’ decision. After that, Abel considered Kane as his greatest enemy and sought to destroy Kane. As time passed both had to fight their own fates but the vendetta remained in their hearts. When both men finally grew older, their son and daughter fell in love and got married. They never agreed on the marriage because of their personal hatred of each other. Abel succeeded to buy the bank stocks of Kane’s Bank to hold the power to veto Kane. At the end of the story, both confronted each other for the second and last time. After that Kane died and after his death, Abel learned that it was Kane who backed him financially to start his hotel business. The story was told like a magician and is a powerful portrait of a world that readers would never forget."

    "Answer": "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about a book that had a major influence on me. I am going to tell you the name of the book and the author, what I remember of it and why it is so significant to me.\n\nFunnily enough, I was thinking about this book only the other day.  It is called ‘The Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse’, I don’t know why I remembered it suddenly, but I had to google to look up the author. It is by Ursula Moray Williams, but I didn’t know that when I first read it.\n\nAs to how I first heard of the book, I can’t really say! It is actually a children’s book, and I think it must have been chosen for me by my parents as I don’t remember actually buying it with anyone, and I don’t think it was a birthday gift or it would have had an inscription in its front cover. The copy I had was a rather tatty paperback with an orange cover and published by a then famous book company called Puffin Books. It had a picture of crudely fashioned toy wooden horse on the front. The horse had a cylindrical body and straight legs fastened onto a board with four wheels on it. The horse had a flowing mane and tail, and in my copy was facing away from the reader, heading off on its’ adventures.\n\nThe story was so very sad! The horse in the title was a toy horse originally supposed to be sold by his maker. The little wooden horse is very loyal and wants only to stay with his Uncle Peder who crafted him. However, sadly the toymaker is forced out of business as mass-produced toys become available, and the little wooden horse sets out to try and make his fortune so the two of them can stay together. Terrible things happen to the horse, he is sometimes lonely and unhappy. Eventually, though, he does make his fortune (I can’t remember how) and returns home only to find the toymaker has vanished! It is heart-breaking. In the end, the little wooden horse and the toymaker are reunited by chance and there is, at last, a happy ending after a harrowing set of adventures.\n\nThe reason this book is important to me is that it is the first book I remember really wanting to read for myself. My mum and dad would take turns to read me just one chapter at night, but there were lots and lots of chapters – about twenty I think, and I was so upset not knowing how the story would end if one chapter was finished and the poor little wooden horse was left in distress! I could read a bit, but not that well, and not well enough to read silently in my head. Anyway, one night, after my parents had closed the book and left me alone, I carried on reading all by myself. I had to read out loud, and the story was so sad I was sobbing as I read, which made it even harder for me to get the words out and finish the story. Even so, I carried on reading right to the end and fortunately, the story did end happily! I can still remember this, even though I must have only been about four years old at the time.  My parents remember the episode too. They could hear me in my room reading aloud and crying, and they said it was heart-rending to listen to, but also quite impressive, as I was so stubbornly determined to do this, and on my own.\n\nI have never re-read the book as an adult. I’m afraid if I did and found it wasn’t really very good or very well written it might spoil the memory for me. I prefer to imagine it as the most brilliant story ever written even if that isn’t true at all! So the book is special because it is probably the book that encouraged me to read, as well as being probably my earliest memory."

    "Answer": "The book that tremendously influenced me in my college level is titled \"Pather Panchali\" by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay. This book was published in 1929 and later a movie was made with the same title by Satyajit Ray. The book is a tragedy and family drama which is considered to be one of the finest literary works in Bengali literature.\n\nThis book deals with the life, happiness, sadness and inner-picture of Roy family in a rural area. Later they moved to a different place in search of a better life but they had to face a great deal of anguish and losses during their travel to a new transition.\n\nThe book describes the rural life, the people of this rural place, their sufferings, their joys, the beautiful countryside, green fields, paddy fields, flowers and many more things that become alive in the story. The storyline, the mastery of story-telling ability, the scenic beauty of the rural area, the tragic death of a touchy character all were so profoundly expressed that I was deeply touched. Moreover, this book was written by one of the superb and talented writers who had a natural talent in describing rural beauty in a style that no other writer can do.\n\nThe book reminded me of the rural area I had once been to. It was like travelling to the past in a time machine. Bibhutibhushan is a gifted writer and probably the best of his type. He had the ability to depict rural life and scenic beauty profoundly and perfectly. The characters of his books come from ordinary places and lead ordinary lives, but the impression they create in readers' mind is extraordinary."

    "Answer": "For a person like me, who has lived all his life in a small place like Hong Kong, visiting any other country is always very “liberating” in a sense that I am not afraid to “get lost” in a bigger world. But, visiting Germany was like a fairy tale come true for me.\n\nI started to become curious about Germany after meeting a German co-worker of mine who was working with me in the same company. But when he left Hong Kong after his job contract was over, and when he invited me to visit his country during the summer, I started to plan for my visit. Of course, I went there alone because I have always felt rather comfortable visiting other places alone.\n\nThere were just so many things to see and do in Germany. But, after arriving there in the city of “Cologne” (hometown of my German friend), the first thing, I did, was to take a river cruise on the Rhine river which allowed me to enjoy the mesmerizing beauty of the German countryside, with its captivating landscapes, elegant old castles, perched on the nearby hilltops, and vineyards which stretched as far as the eye can see. Then I also went to see the Cologne Cathedral which is over 700 years old and a UNESCO world heritage site because of its masterpiece gothic architecture. I also enjoyed the pastries, apart from other delicious German food, from the pastry shops of literally each and every corner of Cologne so much so that I felt like I was going to spend all my holiday funds on buying pastries!\n\nAnyway, I truly enjoyed visiting Germany mainly because it has such rich traditions and histories. Besides, I think that German arguably is the most beautiful and diversified country in Europe with so many unique things to see and do. Besides, seeing people, who are very disciplined, efficient and organized, not only in their daily lives but also in their rare inventions, from up close is a truly unique experience."

    "Answer": "I like to visit famous places and whenever I get a vacation, I try to visit new cities or places that my friends recommend me. One such trip that I took with one of my friends was in Holland. I would like to talk about this tour that we took 2 years ago.\n\nBoth of us wanted to visit Holland and specifically Amsterdam, Hague and Rotterdam very much because we heard stories from our friends about this beautiful and wonderful country. So finally we applied for the visa, bought plane tickets, booked a hotel, packed our bags and our trip began.\n\nWe spent a significant amount of time before our holiday, researching all the interesting places to be. According to our plan, we went to Rijks museum, Van Gogh museum, Amstel Beer museum, took a sunset cruise on the water channels, drove to Volendam - a small and beautiful fisherman village, and visited a cheese farm. We went to Rotterdam, which is the architecture city of Holland that stimulates innovation. We enjoyed the architectures and building there as much as we did walking on the beaches. Visiting the famous Anne Frank house was an exciting moment for me. I've read Anne Frank's Diary in my early childhood and witnessing the place was very much exciting.\n\nEvery evening we took long walks along the channels, which Amsterdam has a lot of. Street artists were performing everywhere and many people came to watch their show.\n\nWe enjoyed everything we did and especially in such a beautiful country. Having my friend by my side on this trip made it even more fun. Since we have never been to Holland, everything we saw and did seemed exciting and completely new to us. People, their way of interpreting their culture attracted us very much. Before leaving the place, both of us agreed that the place is worth visiting and someday we would come back to re-explore it."

    "Answer": "Once I was reading an article and came across the lines of the famous poet Rabindranath Tagore highlighting the beauty of Taj Mahal. It stated, “The Taj Mahal rises above the banks of the river like a solitary tear suspended on the cheek of time”. The lines encouraged me to visit the monument of love - The Taj Mahal. I would like to thank you for letting me talk about this trip that I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nTaj Mahal is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. So, before I thought of visiting any other sight in India, it becomes more of a responsibility to give a visit to this monument of love. It was the prime reason I visited Taj Mahal.\n\nIt was a short trip with my family. My parents and my brother accompanied me on my trip. It was a fun-filled trip as after a long time I got an opportunity to spend time with my family. Moreover, we opted for a road trip so that we had the flexibility to visit other famous places in Agra. It is rightly said, that journey matters, and not the destination, and this is what I experienced during my short trip. I would like to take such a trip with my family again.\n\nThe Taj Mahal meaning 'Crown of the Palace' is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in Agra and once we reached there, the beautiful architect and surrounding place took our heart away! We stayed there for more than three hours and completely enjoyed our time. It was like witnessing a dream in real life."

    "Answer": "I have just a few minutes to tell you about a website I often browse. I will tell you what the website is, how long I’ve been using it, a bit about what is on it and why I visit it so often.\n\nThe website is the BBC news website. You can find it at www.bbc.co.uk/news but I just have it as a favourite on my toolbar. I am a complete BBC junkie! I visit the website several times a day if I can, and have been using it for as long as I can remember. Possibly for as long as the website has been in existence but definitely for the past ten years or more.\n\nThe BBC news website is massive. It contains rolling headlines of breaking news, and from the landing page, you can jump to sections on different types of news categories. For example, there are tabs for world news; health issues; environmental reports; education; sport; education and science as well as entertainment and arts stories. You can read text-based articles illustrated with a few pictures – which is my preferred way of accessing news and information – or you can opt to see news film or audio clips. I think the website is really comprehensive and easy to use too.\n\nThe BBC News website, for me, is a one-stop location for all current affairs and news items. I really like that I can see headlines of breaking news almost instantaneously, but it also includes more thoughtful reporting. Detailed online articles with considered analysis of global or local events. I can also find out what the weather forecast is – always handy in the UK where it can change so quickly, plus I like to be able to keep an eye on what is happening locally to me in Sheffield where I live. I also trust the BBC website to give balanced reporting, I think it has journalistic integrity, so I feel if I read it every day, I will have a good perspective on what is going on in the world, and enough information to come to my own conclusions on current affairs across the globe. The only downside of the website is that I find it can be a bit addictive! Because it is updated frequently it is tempting to keep going back and having another look if there is some running news item that I am following. It can lead me to procrastinate when I am supposed to be working, but I tell myself it is important to keep up to date with what is going on in the world, even though I know that really, it wouldn’t hurt to limit myself to news ‘fix’ just a couple of times a day!\n\nI wonder if others use the website too and if they do, whether they might as avid followers as I am!"

    "Answer": "Sometimes, in these days, I really wonder as to what we really would do if we didn’t have any internet and if it didn’t allow us the opportunity to search for answers on a daily basis. More importantly, would the internet be considered effective and important enough if we didn’t have websites like “quora.com”, which I often browse, by the way. The simple answer is “no”.\n\nSo, why “quora.com”?  Before we get into that discussion, please allow me first to tell what it really is. Well, quora.com, started its journey in 2009, is an American ‘question-and-answer’ where questions are asked, answered and edited by the “learned and expert” internet users. The answers could either be based on “facts” or “expert opinions”. Since then, “Quora” has worked to improve its navigational features and usability, as well as by adding and extending the features to mobile devices, mobile application, that is, which I have on my smartphone as well.\n\nQuora has also introduced a “blogging” platform in order to allow users to post ‘non-answer’ contents. Today, with more than 300 million monthly users, Quora, which I have been using for more than last 5 years or so, has established itself to be one of the leading “reliable” online resources for different kinds of knowledge and information. This website also allows to display “ads” on a limited scale, and is published in at least 15 different languages to help the users from all over the world as best as it can.\n\nAnyway, back to answering the question as to why I exactly use or browse the website. Well, I browse it mainly because it allows me to learn about many things and information by actually comparing the answers of different users without spending too much time. Besides, it also allows me to improve my “linguistic” abilities, as far as my English language is concerned, as I also contribute to this great website from time to time. Finally, this website gives me a “confidence” boost at an “intellectual” level when I get “upvote” or “encouraging” comments for my “2-cent” worth of opinions."

    "Answer": "I've been using the internet for more than 10 years and from the very beginning until now, there are some websites that I use almost every day. www.yahoo.com is one of those websites and possibly I'll use this site forever or maybe as long as it exists!\n\nYahoo is basically an e-mail service provider and a popular search engine. I can still remember my first day at a cyber cafe where I browsed the first website of my life and that was yahoo.com and the cafe owner helped me to open an e-mail address and I still use it to send and receive emails.\n\nYahoo! is a popular search engine, possibly next to Google but as an email service provider, it is quite popular. This website has many other useful features. For instance, the homepage contains up-to-date news. Recently the www.answers.yahoo.com has become one of the most popular questions and answers website which is used by millions around the globe. Yahoo! was initially owned by an American multinational technology company named Yahoo Inc. and the headquartered of this company was in Sunnyvale, California. Now it is owned by Verizon Communications. It was founded around 24 years ago and it is still one of the most visited websites in the world.\n\nI go to this website more than twice a day on an average. The email service it offers is quite excellent. I also participate in the answers.yahoo.com website to post my questions or to answer questions posted by others. The pointing system of this answer-question based sub-domain of the yahoo website makes it quite remarkable and popular."

    "Answer": "I use the internet daily and there are many websites that I often browse for different reasons. But probably www.facebook.com is the one I most often browse. It is a social networking website and probably is one of the top 5 most visited websites in the world. The website mainly facilitates me to stay connected with my friends and helps me update and broadcast my news as well.\n\nThough the primary purpose of this website is to let people communicate with friends and make new friends, it has many other features. It offers online games, eCommerce facility, email exchange option, chatting features, social marketing tools, different campaign creation options, fan page management feature and so on. I have been using this website since 2004 and it is important to me because all of my friends and relatives are connected there. If a friend has a birthday, the website notifies me and I can wish him/ her a birthday, if someone has a new photo or news to share, I can see it from my account. I can share my photo, video, updates, and thoughts as well. If someone opines on an issue, others can comment on it.\n\nFor me, the website is important because my childhood friends, adolescence friends, college & university friends are connected there. I get their updates regularly and can let them know what's happening over here. In no other way, I could have been connected to the people I am now connected via Facebook. I use this website from my computer and from my cell phone as well. For me, this is a social networking website where I remain close to my friends and relatives. But with its own right, it has become a powerful eCommerce platform, gaming place, marketing channel, and advertisement tool.\n\nNowadays everybody owns a Facebook ID. Making new friends is easy on Facebook and that helps people grow their friends beyond the boundary. Millions of people use Facebook and it is almost impossible to connect with people you care and know without this website."

    "Answer": "Nobody really likes “accidents”, but still, they take place and affect our lives significantly when it is least expected. Today, I would like to talk about one such accident which took place at one of the major and busiest intersections of my hometown.\n\nIf I remember correctly, I was coming back from my office on a public bus on a Friday late afternoon a couple of months ago, the road was a bit more busy and congested than usual perhaps because of the rush to return home quickly from work. The traffics of both small and big vehicles were flowing from all directions through 6 major roads with at least 2 roads curving down slightly while approaching the intersection. On a regular day with regular traffic flow and regular traffic speed, of course, this slight road “anomaly” wouldn’t exactly pose much of a problem or risk unless a significant number of new drivers/people out of the town, who are unfamiliar with this road “anomaly”, was driving in those roads and trying to take over each other in hurry.\n\nBut, unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened on that “fateful” Friday afternoon, and the result was a sudden and unavoidable “accident” between a 12-wheel truck and a private car as the big truck was trying to overtake the car at a dangerous speed in order to avoid the “red” traffic signal while hitting the car, leaving at least one car passenger seriously injured. The accident happened so fast that I just stared at the accident site in “shock and fear” with a “numb” feeling on my whole body for a while.   \n\nAnyway, after witnessing the accident, I initially felt very shocked and scared. Then, after recollecting myself, I felt a sense of real anger and rage in me as if I was going to “hurt” the truck driver because of his senseless and totally irresponsible acts. I also felt that I needed to take up the issue to the road authority so that they could immediate steps to “fix” the roads as soon as possible in the greater interest of public safety."

    "Answer": "The most mortifying accident that I have ever witnessed is the one that I saw near (...say the name of the place...) while a train smashed a passenger bus near an intersection. I saw the accident almost 4 years ago and I can remember the event vividly even today, and the experience still traumatises me.\n\nI was on my way to my hometown on a vacation from the capital city where I’m currently residing in. There is a train pass/cross on the road and our bus stopped at the signal. I was busy reading a magazine and all of a sudden, I heard a loud crashing sound and I looked through the window. What I saw was unimaginable - the fast passing train had hit a bus that was trying to pass the intersection. The bus flew away like a toy and we could hear the unbearable screaming of victims. Lots of people had gathered there and the train was passing slowly. People became speechless on the effect of the devastating accident. I could see people trying to help the wounded sufferers and 2-3 ambulances reached there after 15 minutes or so. The bus driver was blamed for the incident and I heard that he was dead too. Our bus could not move forward as traffic broke down. The wounded people were taken to nearby hospitals and the dead bodies were placed in a nearby field. The entire place became a dismal area and people mourned on the event. I started feeling sick and tried to help the wounded people.\n\nI have witnessed more than 30 people lying dead and their relatives were crying and mourning ruefully. I left the place after 4/5 hours and could not think of anything else. The whole event occurred in a few minutes and the effect was devastating. I had spent nearly 2 weeks in a hallucination and thought a lot about the people who died there and about their grieving relatives. It came to my mind that, our life is hanging on the cliffs and we are sometimes so helpless."

    "Answer": "The idea of an accident sounds like it should be bad. But sometimes accidents are quite comical to watch and if nobody is hurt then I think it is OK to laugh.\n\nI’m going to tell you a story about an accident I saw a very, very long time ago, but I can remember it really well, you’ll find out why in a bit… I’ll explain where the accident took place, where I was, a bit of detail about the incident and how it affected me.\n\nThe accident took place in a large old house that was in very poor repair. I was unemployed at the time and was sharing the house with a few friends who were also job-seeking as we had all just finished at university. It was in the 1980s and it was very difficult to get work in the UK at that time. We had chosen the house because it was really cheap. The way it was set out wasn’t very safe, there was a tiny kitchen on a stairwell that we all had to share, and this meant that many of our communal chats took place sitting on the stairs gathered around the landing.\n\nOn this particular day, it was the first thing in the morning. We were all half asleep and stumbling around just in our dressing gowns or nightwear. I was sat at the top of the stairs (near to the kitchen) waiting to use the kitchen as one of my friends, Gill, had got in their first and there wasn’t room for both of us. Another of our housemates appeared at the bottom of the stairs and sat there looking tearful and crestfallen. She had had a terrible argument with her boyfriend and was very upset. Gill, who was already in the kitchen, kindly offered to make her a cup of tea – but as she was putting the kettle on she was distracted by the tears of our upset mutual friend. Gill turned to talk to her just as she was lighting the gas – catastrophe! The flame caught her dressing gown and the next moment the whole garment seemed on fire. I gasped, my tea-making friend thought quickly, she ripped off her clothes, and rolled on the floor, tumbling down the stairs ending up in a naked heap at the feet of our crying companion. The shock of this sight caused the sobs to stop. ‘Why are you at the bottom of the stairs and why have you got no clothes on?’ queried our now no-longer crying friend. I and my friend Gill just laughed uproariously, partly with relief (it could have been a lot worse) and partly with disbelief.  Our upset friend had been so preoccupied with her own worries she’d missed the entire thing. We couldn’t believe it when it was all so dramatic.\n\nHow did the accident affect me? It just made me laugh a lot at the time, and even now when I remember it I do so with a smile. It was such a ridiculous thing to happen, and it certainly broke the rather serious mood the morning had started with. I also think we were very lucky, it might not have ended that way. There is a saying that ‘all’s well that ends well’ – that was certainly the case here.\n\nPerhaps it isn’t true to say that no-one was hurt in this story, I think that maybe pride was hurt quite a bit, but it was a long time ago and the main ‘victim’ of this story, Gill, still laughs about it with me now!"

    "Answer": "Wow, talking about an accident I saw is quite challenging! I can think an example, but it wasn’t nice to witness. I’ll tell you where the accident occurred and where I was at the time, a bit of extra detail about what happened, and then finally I’ll tell you what happened. That seems a logical way to explain it.\n\nThe accident took place in the outdoor arena of a large horse riding school, where I was sharing a jumping lesson with a friend. The backdrop to where it took place is really beautiful, as the equestrian centre is set in a rural location in the picturesque countryside of Glossop, which is within an area known as the High Peaks in the county of Derbyshire, England.\n\nMy friend and I both wanted to improve our technique of jumping. I’m quite an experienced rider, but not very confident jumping – I prefer flat work, my friend is a great athlete, but new to horse riding, she was very confident, but not very experienced. We had warmed up already, riding our horses around under the guidance of an instructor at walk, trot and canter. We’d taken the horses over some low cross-poles, which are small jumps you commonly use when you are teaching either a horse or rider to jump so they can gain confidence. About 15 minutes into the lesson, we started to take it in turns to try slightly bigger fences, but nothing too challenging. I’d already taken my horse over, and it was my friend’s turn to try. So I was sat on my horse watching her as she rode towards the fence. The instructor and I were both very calm, as was my friend, it was a small cross pole, and nothing she and the horse hadn’t done before.\n\nShe trotted her pony to the jump, but then at the last minute, her mount just stumbled, literally tripping over the poles. Perhaps because my friend was a bit inexperienced, it caused her to lose her balance, the teacher and I both gasped, and then laughed as she seemed to recover herself and ended up back in the saddle…\n\nUnfortunately, we relaxed too soon, the horse seemed to still have her feet in a knot and so tripped again, this time the forward momentum catapulted my friend into the air. We watched in slow motion as she went up in a huge arc, and then fell towards the ground. Unfortunately, her instinct was to put her hand out to break her fall, this meant her arm was completely extended and she took the full weight of her body onto just one hand. We heard a sickening split as the bones in her lower arm broke, and it was very obvious that she had a serious injury. She was still conscious but in an awful lot of pain.\n\nYou never quite know how you will behave in an accident. I went into a very calm mode, I quickly dismounted and caught the loose horse, who was a bit confused about what had happened. The instructor called an ambulance, and I took the horses back to the yard, explained what had happened, and arranged for people to stand at various points on the property to help direct the ambulance to where it was needed before going back to the school. Unfortunately, the instructor was rather squeamish, she couldn’t bear the sight of blood and so although she was handling the situation well, she couldn’t really look at my friend. So I sat near her and tried to keep her talking while we all waited for the ambulance. We knew it was very important she didn’t move in case she had broken her back as well, and we were trying to keep her conscious so it would be possible for the paramedics to assess her more easily when they came.\n\nThe ambulance took a very, very long time to arrive because of our remote location. However, when they came they were fantastic.  They gave my friend a lot of morphine – which is a very powerful painkiller – and were incredibly calm. I had to help roll her onto the stretcher, but we were very relieved when she went off to the hospital safely. Her arm was very badly damaged. She has had lots of operations and I’m not sure if she will be riding again!\n\nThe accident affected me quite a lot because I was astounded that she was so unlucky in how she fell. The horse just tripped, it wasn’t being naughty or difficult, and it all happened in slow motion so right up until the last minute I thought she might be alright. I was pleased how well I and the instructor worked together to get help, and that I’d been able to stay calm and focused at the time. Since then I have jumped again, but really I think I’ve decided to stick to flatwork (dressage) from now on. Watching an accident makes you realise how fragile life can be and how easily and quickly you can be hurt, not through being stupid, but just through being unlucky."

    "Answer": "Childhood memories are strange things because sometimes you can’t quite be sure if you really remember something, or if you just think you do because others have told you about it, or you have seen a photo of the event later on. I’m going to talk to you about a memory that I’m very confident is real. I’ll tell you what it is, when it happened, how it affected me and why I still remember it. Thank you for this great cue card topic.\n\nThe memory is the earliest one I have of me and my Dad. I was very small indeed, I’m not exactly sure how old, but I’d guess about three years old, maybe even younger. My Dad was not a particularly tall or strong man, but I was small enough, and by comparison, he was big enough then for me to stand with both my feet on one of his and to reach up with my arms and cling onto his leg. I would then hang on and laugh delightedly as he tried to go about his daily business, walking around the house with me gripping on tightly refusing to be budged. It was a favourite game.\n\nI don’t know that I can honestly say it affected me in my life. These days our family members don’t live particularly close to one another; so see each other rather infrequently. I suppose the way the incident affected me was by making me at a subconscious level feel close to my dad even years later as we had shared that happy playtime together when I was tiny.\n\nI didn’t know I had held onto this memory until quite recently.  Sadly my dad died, he had been very ill for a long time, so it wasn’t unexpected, but of course, it was very sad. I wanted to say something about him at his funeral, and I wanted to pick a memory that was personal just to him and to me. For some reason that image of me tiny and laughing and him solemnly ‘pretending’ that he hadn’t noticed I was there came into my mind and it seemed very appropriate somehow to share that one. It was a happy memory, but also an intimate one. I think he would have been really pleased that I could recall it so many decades later.\n\nSo why can I remember it?  I’m not sure, but I like to think the memory was there dormant all the time just waiting for the moment when I needed to retrieve it. It is a comforting thing to recall. The human mind is an amazing thing and so is our childhood!"

    "Answer": "Life is full of many, many memories that we cherish for many years to come. But childhood memories are somewhat special because they shape up our beliefs and lifestyle in a rather direct manner, and today I would like to talk about one such childhood memory.\n\nI remember it like it all happened just yesterday. But, I am talking about something which happened about 15 years ago. Back then, as a child, one of my most favourite things to do was to visit my grandparents’ house in the countryside during the summer vacations, when the schools were closed. And, we visited them only during the summertime because my parents lived far away from my grandparents because of their jobs. Anyway, visiting my grandparents would allow me to visit their bee farm out in the countryside by riding on a bicycle with my grandfather, who would paddle it real quick. My grandfather also used to raise cows on the farm in order to collect fresh milk. When we would arrive on the farm, we would leave the milk jars in a lake nearby, after milking the cows, so that it would remain cool. And, once we would return home after finishing farming activities with my grandfather, grandmother would serve us with freshly-made and delicious homemade food, bread, fresh milk and, of course, honey.\n\nAnyway, I remember it because these great memories from my childhood have made me realize the value of living in the countryside instead of living in a busy and monotonous city environment. Besides, it also made me appreciate and understand the value of being close to the loved ones and visiting them as often as possible, no matter how busy we really are. Finally, I remember it because I just don’t really think that it is ever possible to forget about the unbeatable experience of enjoying freshly-harvested honey, collected straight from the bee farm, and home-made bread, let alone the anticipation, the intense excitement of visiting my grandparents on the eve of every summer vacation, and the sleepless night before visiting my grandparents in the countryside."

    "Answer": "I still remember many childhood memories and some of them had a profound impact on my life. Sometimes those memories appear so lucid that it seems only a few days ago! Anyway, a childhood memory that I can still remember so vividly is when I observed a few dead people for the first time in my life. I would like to take the opportunity to talk about it.\n\nI was then seven or eight years old and was in grade three in my school. One day I heard that a devastating accident had occurred near our house. My mother asked me whether I wanted to go or not! I agreed to go as I thought it would be an exciting experience - only if I knew! I went with my mother and a few neighbours and speculated lots of thing about the accident but when I watched 10 dead people lying on a nearby playground and among them two were kids, I was confounded about the whole event. I started feeling sick and very devasted. This was, in fact, too much for me to digest.\n\nI had no idea how devastating the accidents could be. The dead people, especially the dead bodies of two kids, stroke me really hard. I noticed many people were shocked by the outcome of the event and many of them were discussing how this terrible accident might have happened. I and my mother returned home and I was unwell for about a week. I asked my mum and dad several realistic and nonsensical questions after I recovered from the initial shock. Some of their replies were quite hard for me to understand and yet something inside me had changed and that change was permanent. Sometimes I wonder if the changes were for bad, but now I realise it was for good.\n\nThis memory is important to me because it helped me to think about life in a different way. Some even thought my mother shouldn't have taken me there but due to this event, I could realise at an early age what the dead is and how fragile our lives are. This memory helped me to grow faster and opened my eyes to this flamboyant yet a transient world."

I spent my entire childhood there and the place is filled with my childhood memories. Childhood, is perhaps, the most enchanting and beautiful time in our lives and I cherish my childhood memory very much. One particular memory of my childhood I would never forget is the time I first saw the devastating effect of the accident. This event has significant importance in my life.\n\nLike most other school going kids, I wanted to be the Superman or the Spiderman in life. Life was full of dreams and fantasy. One day I was walking with my mum and heard from the neighbours that a severe accident has happened nearby. I was a bit confused about what it was all about. Finally, I and my mum reached the place where the accident took place. We saw that people had made a crowd around the victims who were already dead. I observed the dead for the first time in my life. We did not stay there for a long. After returning home I felt sick. Later on, I started realising that our lives are fragile and are not eternal. We all will die someday no matter what we think we are.\n\nThat event helped me grow up quickly and become stronger mentally. Not that I became pessimist from the event, but a realisation always knocked me. I started changing some of my silly attitudes after the event. I started caring for my parents, relatives, and never harmed a defenceless creature. I learned that our days are numbered and we've to make the best use of it. I was so deeply touched that I started praying every day and became kind even to the kids who were hostile to me. Some people might think that the event was devastating for a kid, but to me, it revealed reality in front of me."

    "Answer": "Describing my study room is easy – but perhaps a little embarrassing for me as it is not very tidy! Thank you for this nice topic.\n\nI am lucky because there is a ‘spare’ room in my flat which I can use as a study space. That’s the good news but the problem is that the room has also ended up being a dumping ground for everything else that doesn’t have a home. It is full of clutter. The room hosts a large double bed, already made up in case of guests, and a wardrobe. Also stored in the room are a Henry Hoover (a type of vacuum cleaner); an ironing board, a clothes rack, and a set of low clothes rails that I use to hang out washing to dry. These items and bits of furniture all added together don’t leave very much space for me to work in. Even so, I have a table in the corner of the room. It is quite light, as it is positioned right underneath a duplex window.\n\nThe table is reasonably sized, but I’m afraid it’s also rather cluttered. I have a couple of sets of in-trays on my desk, full of writing paper items (notebooks and reams of A4 paper), together with letters and documents awaiting my attention. There is also a tin full of pens, pencils, highlighters and other odds and ends which take up more space, and an old shoebox full of envelopes and cards that I tend to stock up on in case I need to send a friend a birthday card or quick message. That doesn’t leave any spare room, so my printer is on the floor under the table. I have to crawl on my hands and knees to retrieve papers from it when necessary!\n\nEven though the space isn’t ideal, I do try and discipline myself to go in there every day to do some work free of other distractions. At least a couple of hours a day, but obviously if I have an important deadline then I can spend all day and half the night in there ‘burning the midnight oil’ to use an English expression. I sit on a little swivel office chair which is extremely comfortable.\n\nMy ideal study room would be airy, spacious and uncluttered. It would be a dedicated room, rather than a shared space that ends up collecting all the overflow from every other room in the home. I’d have a huge table, with neat piles of documents and space to spread out reference materials if needed. I’d prefer a window I could properly see out of, rather than one in the roof, but I do like the natural light. If money were no object, all my stationery would match, and I’d have a printer that never jammed or ran out of ink. A neat wooden filing cabinet would contain all my paperwork filed away in an orderly fashion. In one corner I’d have a cosy armchair by a window overlooking a beautiful garden. When I needed inspiration I’d be able to sit in it, gazing out of the view and thinking wise thoughts. I’d also like an endlessly refilling pot of hot fresh coffee, though I expect if I did all that caffeine would be very bad for me.\n\nSo you can see why I’m a little embarrassed by my study room, I’m ashamed it is such a cluttered area. Even so, when I find I’m really focused on some interesting project I don’t notice my surroundings. Unfortunately, if I don’t really want to face up to the task I’m supposed to be working on then it is very easy to be distracted when I’m so squashed in by the chaos around me. One day I might have to have a serious clear up, though I really don’t know where else I’d put all those things if I do."

But, still, I will make a sincere effort to describe my study room as it exists.\n\nMy study room is not exactly very big, but it is home to literally dozens of items, apart from books, bookshelves, desk and chairs, computer and other reading materials. I spend at least 6/7 hours of my time in my tiny study room, whether I am studying or not, because this is where I can think and feel like a “free-spirited” person. However, even though, I like my study room in its current “state”, I feel like it doesn’t look like an “ideal study room” to me as it lacks a “purpose”.\n\nAnyway, my ideal study room should be as big as 100 square feet which would be located in one corner of the house, away from all kinds of “human-made” noise. It should also have a couple of windows so that enough fresh air and sunlight can enter the room to get me in the mood to study. It should also have a balcony so that I could sit there and enjoy watching nature a little during a study interval. Finally, I would also like my study room to have a perfect lighting scheme that matches the interior painting nicely.\n\nAnyway, ideal or not, I do like my study room in its current arrangement with all kinds of different books, reading materials and old furniture in it because this is where I can think and feel like a “schismatic” person. Besides, even though, it has a rather small window, it is just enough to carry the pleasing sounds of birds chirping to my ears, in order to cheer me up, when I feel down. Finally, my study room may be old with some cracks in it, but it never fails to give me hope about my life and future whenever I study in it."

One bookshelf is filled with storybooks and the other one with academic books. I keep my notepads, diary, boxes and other necessary things inside the study desk. I read mostly on my desk. However, I prefer reading novels in bed. My study room has not got plenty of luxurious furniture but I keep my things organised and clean. During the daytime, I keep my windows open and prefer not to turn on the light. My mother sometimes takes the authority to clean the room. I have arranged my storybooks based on the Author's name and the academic books based on Subjects.\n\nMy ideal study room would be spacious and neatly furnished. It should be quiet so that I am not distracted by noise. I would not prefer to have so many pieces of furniture as open space would be perfect for someone's study room. It should have a music system in case I need refreshment. All the stationery would be placed in boxes and should be easy to find. I would like to have a large table and a comfortable chair so that I can sit for a long and work painlessly. Finally, it must welcome the natural light and fresh air so that I can feel comfortable being in this room.\n\nMy study room, which is ironically also my living room, gives me comfort in terms of quietness. There are several other rooms in our house but my study room is quite soothing to me. I feel more relaxed in my study room than any other room in our house."

    "Answer": "I have heard many times that 'money just can’t buy everything', but it certainly can buy some exceptional “gifts”, and I figured it out when I took a vacation to Europe (courtesy to the unexpected tax refunds in a check, which I received from the US government last year. Now, you may wonder what kind of gift I am talking about.\n\nWell, I am jealous of Europe and its people for two reasons. First, they work fewer hours and enjoy more vacation time than us “American” people. Secondly (I know, if I say this, many of my American compatriot citizens are going to “hate” me), they are arguably more “smart” than American people in general, and Sean Jeffry, my long-time British friend, has proved it by offering me such a gift which has put an American like me to shame. It’s a collection of some of the “American all-time movie hits”, a gift idea, I think that only a very few American people could come up with, even on the best of the occasions. At least, I have never heard of any of my own American friends or family members offering this kind of gifts to anybody. After receiving such a gift, which also included some of my favourite movies, I felt like I couldn’t possibly receive any better gifts than this from a “foreigner friend” who lives in a different continent in another part of the world.\n\nAnyway, I feel like this was the best gift I have ever received because my friend used a lot of his time and efforts to actually be able in order to find and make the list of all the movies in Hollywood movie history. Besides, it also takes a special friend and person to learn and remember about the preference, whatever that may be, of his friend, and my friend Sean proved that he is just that kind of friend and person. Finally, I consider this to be the best gift I have ever received because I received it when I expected it in the least."

    "Answer": "I have received numerous gifts in my life and among them, the most exciting one was the Laptop my father gave to me when I was 14 years old. When I was 10, I found that many of my friends had their own computers and I was profoundly fascinated by this wonderful machine and dreamt about owning one someday. I would like to thank you for the chance to let me talk about the best gift that I have ever received - luckily it was a gift that came from the person I really admire.\n\nAfter being promoted to grade six in my school, I got admitted to a computer training centre and learned some basic computing. Whenever I visited a friend or a classmate who had a computer, I felt fascinated being there-  especially when I could play games, learn how to operate a new software, browse the Internet, edit a picture and so on. I sometimes visited some of my friends’ houses more often than usual only because they had computers. Thus this phenomenon machine became the only dream of my life. As I knew my father was not in a financial condition to buy me a brand new computer, I did not ask for one. I made a dummy computer using papers, boards and other materials and played with it- something unusual for a boy at my age! One day I bought a piggy bank and started saving coins and notes with the sole intention to buy a computer someday. After one month or so, I found that I saved only ten dollars in total and that was somewhat frustrating!\n\nWith time, and I would say with a little maturity, I got busy with other stuff and could hardly find time to visit friends’ houses to use their computers, but at a hidden corner of my heart, I felt the same fascination for owning a computer. On my 14th birthday, my father told me that he wants to take me to the computer shop and purchase a brand new computer for me. I could not believe what I heard! That night it was tough for me to sleep. In the morning I wake up earlier than usual and went to a computer shop with my father. He bought a Dell Laptop that was a Pentium 4 machine. While returning home, I found myself on cloud nine. I opened the box after returning home and showed it to my mother and other relatives.\n\nAs a young child, that was a long-expected gift that my father gave to me, and till now it’s the best present -materialistically speaking, someone gave to me. You know how passionate we can sometimes become, especially in our childhood, when we long for something. I know it was not easy for my father to buy me this computer from his financial condition but still, he sacrificed his other joys to make me happy. That was something truly special."

    "Answer": "First of all, I would like to thank you for this nice topic. The best gift or present that I have ever received is a digital dictionary that my mother bought me on my 18th birthday. I was a college student at that time and my parents celebrated my birthday at home. Few friends and relatives were invited and it was a kind of family celebration. I was quite thrilled to open the gift boxes that my friends and family members gave to me and there were some books, chocolate boxes and other gift items. Out of these gifts, an electronic dictionary was something truly amazing. As soon as I opened it, I knew it was a gift from my mother.\n\nI once told my mother about this electronic dictionary and how some of my classmates were using it. I never told my mother that I wanted to buy one but I guess my mother knew very well how much I wanted to own this item. She had to save money, I guess, to purchase it for me and this is the best gift I have ever received in my life considering the passion and love it enwrapped. This was not merely a gift item or an electronic device, it was more than that - like a wonder box wrapped with care and love. My mother is a housewife and managing the money to buy me this gift must have been a result of her many small sacrifices. I thanked my mother for this fabulous gift and she was so happy to see me enthralled about the gift.\n\nIt was a white and small digital dictionary, not more than 4 by 6 inches in dimension, but was one of the latest models. It was quite handy for me and having this dictionary encouraged me to learn more words, their synonyms and their origins.\n\nThe gifts are always good gestures, tokens of appreciation and expression of love in our tradition. This gift was something even more special to me. I knew how much my mother has always loved me and her gift represented her love as well as sacrifices for me. In terms of utilisation, it was quite beneficial too. I could easily carry it in my pocket and I used it often to learn new words and that has helped me enhance my language skill. This is the only gift from my teenage time that I still have. I will always remember my mother's love that was blended with this gift."

    "Answer": "I love to visit popular places whenever I get free time and historic places have a special appeal to me. I have visited a few historic places including Machu Picchu in Peru, The Pyramids at Giza, Taj Mahal in India, and the Parthenon in Greece. The historic significance and the grandeur of these places mesmerise me. The place that I would like to talk about today is Colosseum (also known as Coliseum, or as the Flavian Amphitheatre) which is situated in Rome, Italy. I would like to thank you for the time you have allowed me to talk about it.\n\nIt is basically an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, which is the largest amphitheatre in the world and is made of concrete and stone. The construction of Colosseum began under emperor Vespasian in 70 AD and was completed under Titus in 80 AD.\n\nThe Colosseum could hold approximately 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at the time when it was used as an amphitheatre. Perhaps it is well-known for its use for the gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of many famous battles. The Colosseum was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980 and was also included among the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is 189 meters long, and 156 meters wide, with a base area of 6 acres. The height of the outer wall is 48 meters. The Colosseum nowadays is one of the major tourist attractions in Rome with thousands of tourists each year paying to view the interior arena.\n\nI have heard and seen of this famous place a lot and when I witnessed it for the first time, I became speechless. The huge architect, the overwhelming interior and exterior decoration were beyond appreciation. The place kept reminding me of the classical mythological and historical facts I have read and heard about. Visiting this site was like travelling to the past. I would always like to get back to this place due to its prominence in history and incredible appeal."

    "Answer": "I am going to talk about an amazing historic place that I know about, even though I’ve never visited it. I’ll tell you what it is, where it is, about the historical meaning of the place as much as I can and finally my own experience and reactions regarding it.\n\nI want to tell you about Stonehenge. This is an ancient set of standing stones, arranged in a circle. It is located in Wiltshire, in England, but I think it would be fair to say the image of it would be recognised worldwide, as it is possibly one of the most famous historic sites in the world.\n\nIn terms of the meaning of the place, it’s really impossible to say. It is so very old, even archaeologists aren’t sure exactly when it was built, estimates go back to as long ago as 3000 BC, which is mind-boggling to me! It is certainly accurate to describe it as a prehistoric monument. Some people think it might have started as a burial mound and be even more ancient than 5,000 years. The colossal slabs are arranged like huge door frames, no-one really knows how they were erected without the technology of modern times, but everyone agrees it was an incredible feat of engineering and showed foresight and tenacity in spaces! However, it is certain that they were somehow aligned so that at key stages of the lunar (moon) and solar (sun) cycles, the way the light strikes the stones is of some significance. Apparently, it was deliberately constructed so that the rising sun only reached the middle of the stones for just one day of the year.\n\nLots of people like to try and imagine what sort of ceremonies and importance the stones might have had for the people who built it, but the truth is we can’t say. Even today, modern-day druids have for many years gathered at the stones for the summer solstice (longest day of the year) and winter solstice (shortest day of the year) to watch the sunrise and mark the event with their own celebrations.\n\nFor me, I think this is the ultimate historical place, even though I have yet to visit it. It is just so remarkable to think it was constructed all those thousands of years ago just by physical labour. Even the stones themselves – the largest of which are up to 30 feet and weigh about 25 tons, had to be brought to the site from about 20 miles away, how on earth was that possible? For me, the stones prove that with determination, tenacity and working together it is sometimes possible to achieve what seems impossible. At the same time, the way they have endured over time gives perspective on our place in the world. Time passes, people and generations pass too, but they can leave a legacy behind even if it only one of many unanswered questions for future people to ponder over!"

    "Answer": "Being a “Bangladeshi”, I take pride in many of the historical heritage of my country, including a number of historical places, which has carried a very rich and eventful past of my country for centuries. Today, I would like to talk about one such historical place, called the “Panam city”, which is unique in every true sense.\n\n“Panam city” sits in the city of “Sonargaon”, located about 29 kilometres north of the capital “Dhaka”. Covering an area of almost 20 kilometres, “Panam city” once used to be the capital of the 15th century “Bengal” and thrived as the major inland port and centre of commerce and politics. Later in the 17th and 18th century, it also became the centre of trade for “muslin” (a special but “plain weave” of very fine cotton fabric which was very popular in the European market, the middle east and other markets all over the world for its “very special quality”).\n\nThe “lost city”, as it is called by many and is also known to be the only abandoned city of its kind in the whole world, has about 50+ old houses on the same street. But, even the houses are centuries old, they still bear the regal signs on their ancient walls, bricks and the terracotta on the black stones. Another very significant and unique aspect of this “lost city” is that it marked the end of the line of the “Grand Trunk Road”, one of Asia’s oldest and longest major roads, which had linked the Indian subcontinent with Central Asia for almost 2500 years.  \n\nAnyway, as I was strolling through the “old ruins” of one of the most distinguished cities of the “old world”, I couldn’t help but feeling both the energy and aristocracy sustained from a very “bustling city” of a bygone era. Besides, the medieval houses and monuments under the sunny weather looked like they had a lot of stories to share with us if only they could talk, and we had time to listen and learn from the past that nothing really lasts forever."

    "Answer": "The history of the newspaper goes back to the 17th century when arguably the very first newspaper called “The Oxford Gazette” was ever printed in its current format in 1665. Since then, centuries have passed, and many earth-shattering events have taken place to change the world, but the appeal of newspapers hasn’t diminished. In fact, they have actually gained more popularity among their readers with their “online edition”, such as “BBC online news”, which I am about to talk now.\n\nI read BBC online news at least once a day as it contains pretty much all kinds of news from all over the world. Whether we are talking about the latest fashion trends and style or some of the oldest handicraft items in some unknown part of the world, BBC online news has it all. The news portal doesn’t shy away from talking about controversial political, cultural, spiritual, social and economic issues either which are shaping up our world and opinion on a continuous basis one way or another. It also publishes news on all kinds of sports and international travel activities in as much details as possible. One of the main benefits of reading BBC online is that it gets updated every hour, if not every minute, to bring us the latest news. Besides, we don’t really have to pay any extra money to read them except only the charge for using the internet. Another benefit of reading an online newspaper is that they are more “interactive” as they let their readers publish their views online without any major delay.  \n\nAnyway, I like to read BBC online news mainly because it is widely “trusted” all over the world. In fact, it goes to great length to display pictures and videos of news subjects and events in order to prove their authenticity, which may not be found in some other newspapers. Besides, I also like the fact that it has two editions of the website: a UK edition, which gives prominence to UK stories, and an international edition, which prioritises international news for its international readers like me."

    "Answer": "I read newspapers almost daily and sometimes I purchase or borrow magazines to enjoy its articles. I'd like to describe a magazine that I usually buy each month and enjoy reading a lot. The name of this magazine is PC World - which is a global computer magazine published monthly by IDG in the USA. It offers articles on various aspects of personal computers, electronic gadgets, the internet and technology. In each publication, PC World reviews and tests hardware and software products from a variety of manufacturers, as well as other technology-related devices such as still and video cameras, smartphones, audio devices and televisions.\n\nI have been reading this magazine for the last 6-7 years or so. It is specifically useful for people who love computers, software and technology related news and updates. I am doing my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering and love to learn about new hardware and software. This is a magazine that offers great hardware & software reviews, tips on advanced computing and many other useful articles.\n\nReading a newspaper or a magazine is always beneficial for learning new things. Newspapers provide contemporary local news, international news, editorials, entertainment, sports news and so on. Without reading newspapers or magazines one can't keep himself/herself updated with the latest news and views of the world. I purchase the PC World magazine every month and read it for about 7 days. Sometimes I read older issues as well to find out a particular review or an interesting article. This magazine is helpful for basic, moderate and advanced computer users and techno-lovers. Someone who has a computer should read it to increase his/her knowledge of hardware and software. Even it’s helpful for those who are going to buy computers, printers, cameras, scanners, software and other hardware devices. I enjoy reading it a lot."

    "Answer": "Today I’m going to talk about one of my favourite magazines. It’s quite fun to think about it. The magazine is called ‘Women’s Running’. It’s a monthly publication, dedicated to helping female runners, at every level to improve their running and learn more about the sport.  \n\nFor me the benefits of reading this periodical are huge. It has great information about running techniques and nutrition; advertising features on new running-related products; helpful articles on topics like ‘how to choose new trainers’ and advice on running events and how to prepare for them. That is great in itself, but even more importantly for me, it contains lots of interesting stories - real women talking about their experiences of running, why they do it and how they stay motivated, keep positive and enjoy the sport.  \n\nEven though I do like this magazine, it is really expensive, so I’m embarrassed to admit I don’t always buy my own copy. Instead, I have a friend who subscribes to it regularly. Every few months she has a big clear out, and she drops off a great big bag of magazines for me to read. I then have a binge of reading about running – which is a bit ironic really, I should be out doing it rather than reading about it! So I don’t read it each month, but every few months I’ll have a whole weekend curled up on the sofa avidly soaking up every article. I read each copy from cover to cover. I like the 'personal accounts' best. Women talking about perhaps overcoming injuries and illness to keep on running; forming friendships and achieving goals they never thought possible. It can be really inspirational! It makes me believe that I too can do more than I think. Once I’ve read all the magazines I keep them for a while to refer back to, but eventually, I too need to de-clutter, so I’ll pass them on to another running friend, and so the cycle continues!\n\nThrough reading the magazine I’ve started to think of myself more as part of the ‘running community’. I’ve started to realise that not everyone who takes part in running is choosing to do ultra-marathons, we can all run at our own level and still get the fitness and social benefits at whatever level we are at. The main competition is not with other people but with yourself, other runners can support and help you whether that’s with advice on how to up your speed or distances to get a new Personal Best or agreeing to go out with you on a wet and windy night when really the sofa looks a great deal more appealing than a rain-soaked pavement in winter!"

But, such happy events become even more meaningful when we are able to share them with other people so that they are also elated. So, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to share one such happy event with you here.\n\nThe event took place about a few years ago in my hometown when I was really busy looking for a new job, after quitting my previous job, and I just didn’t have enough time or interest in helping anybody else except myself. But, that was not to happen because, incidentally, I also happened to be a “founding member” of a local “charity” club in my hometown which used to help the local residents in time of their needs, especially, if they were seriously ill. So, when some of the members from my charity club came to me with a news that one of the residents in our neighbourhood was suffering from “blood cancer” and that he needed a huge amount of money (which the patient didn’t have because of his rather poor financial situation) to get proper treatment, me and my charity club members were left with no choice but to act swiftly to collect enough funds for him. But, collecting such a huge sum of money within such a short period of time, as we literally had to knock on every door in my hometown for help, was not an easy task at all.  Anyway, we finally succeeded, but the happiest moment came when the doctor had informed me that the patient would carry on to live some more years.\n\nIt was indeed a very happy moment of my life because I could help a terminally-ill person save his life and be together with his family again, especially at a time when he lost all his hopes. Besides, the event also made me realize that we can solve “mountain” of problems if we work together."

It was indeed an exhilarating event and that was regarding my success in the board final exam. The moment I heard that I had been awarded a scholarship for my performance in the board exam, I became the happiest man in the world. This was truly a felicitous moment for me as it is something I was looking forward to very eagerly and the news made my parents quite happy and proud. I would like to thank you for letting me talk about this event.\n\nI waited almost a month with great anxiety for my result. I started speculating so many things and many of them were negative. I could hardly stop thinking about my upcoming result during this period. The result was highly important and my college admission was dependent on it. I could not sleep well the night before the result publishing day. I think it is common for students to worry about their results, especially for important exams, and I was familiar with this type of concern. However, I have to admit that I had been more worried about it than other exam results I can remember.\n\nThe result was published at around 11.00 am and I found that I did exceptionally well. I was so relieved and happy that I was on cloud nine. Then I hurriedly returned home and gave the news to my parents. They were very happy. My father, who barely expresses his emotions was also very pleased, and my mother called a few of our relatives to share the good news. I felt excited, happy and relieved. At that time I was about 15 years old. It happened in our hometown called (... say the name of your hometown...). It was so pleasant an event that I still remember every bit of it."

    "Answer": "My face shines with joy whenever I remember the day I went to the International Trade Fair with some of my friends. That was my first visit to that type of fair and this was such a happy experience that I still feel a great joy reciting the memory of this event. It was January 2010 and that time I was in my first year of college.\n\nUntil I finished my college, I was literally a newborn lady, who had never been to a different country or had never visited a large International fair. After I got admitted to my college, I started exploring the world and gradually witnessed amazing things that were waiting just for me to explore! One day I planned with my friends that we would visit the International Trade Fair. This might seem like a very usual and banal event for others, but to me, that was a really exciting thing to do. Later on that day, we did as we planned and finalised our visit to the fair. After the break period at college, we escaped by the back door (as a side note, I would like to mention that I had no previous record of escaping school or college before) and started our monumental journey to the trade fair. We were five in members and we hired a taxi to reach the trade fair. There wasn’t enough space to sit on the back of the taxi and the taxi driver gave us a suspicious look! That’s why with a rough smile we decided that one of us would sit at the front. It was a funny decision but there was no alternative to us and we enjoyed it. I still feel lucky that we decided to take the adventure as it turned out to be one of the most memorable events in my life.\n\nAfter an hour or so, we reached the venue and then collected tickets for five of us. We were thoroughly enjoying everything we did that time. We entered the venue and took a deep breath to ease ourselves. We were kind of overwhelmed to observe the vast area with hundreds of shops and stalls. People were all around us and we felt like somehow we had come to a fairyland. Wherever we went, I was feeling so excited, everything was totally new to me even though I was a grown-up lady. We took lots of photos from different views, purchased a few interesting things within our limited budget and roamed in the whole area. I forgot my usual boundaries and that was an experience that I missed for a long. We spent almost 4-5 hours there and at last returned home in the evening. We returned home by bus and I was so happy that I felt as if I had discovered a new continent."

    "Answer": "As a student of business administration, I had to study all the subjects of business faculty, but one subject, which I found to be unique and interesting during my university, was “Marketing”. But, it became even more interesting when I decided to study the subject with one of the most accomplished academics called Mr Chun Lee.\n\nMr Chun had a unique way of teaching whether he was teaching the basic principles of marketing, consumer behaviour, principle of retailing, new product management, advertising management, pricing policy, new product development or any other marketing concepts, In fact, Mr Lee would assume that, as surprising as it may sound, all of the students in his marketing class was “expert marketeer” and that his students would teach him how to become an expert marketing professional. Besides, he would advise us to consider “marketing” always as a way to “help” consumers instead of aiming at “profiteering” because such practice would help ensure “goodwill” among the prospective consumers in the long run. However, the best aspect, in my opinion, of the teaching methods of Mr Lee was that he didn’t really have any formal test or examination in order to test how much we had learned in his class, and instead all he had for us was some random “case studies”. So, how much exactly did the class of Mr Lee help me?     \n\nWell, whatever I learned from Mr Lee has helped me a lot in real and professional world as it has taught me the art of “listening” (yes, one has to be a really good “listener” if he/she wants to be an expert “Marketeer”) because listening is probably is the most important part of learning how to be an “effective communicator”. Besides, it has also helped me to become habitually aware of the “trends” in different kinds of industries so that I can adjust and adapt accordingly in order to become a successful professional. Finally, it has also helped me to understand the needs of another human being (a “customer” in marketing “term”), not only in the professional sphere but also in personal space, and thus improving the relationship with others in the real world."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this great cue card topic. The subject I would like to talk about is physics and it was taught in our high school as a compulsory subject. We had this subject every year in our high school curriculum and each year a new teacher used to teach us physics. I remember Mr Alex, Burter, John, David and Mrs Jeniffer teaching us physics in different years in my high school. We were lucky to have some great teachers who taught us physics and they had a great way of teaching. Their interesting discussions made the subject worth enjoying.\n\nOur teachers used to tell us fascinating stories first and then relate them to the theory, experiment and mathematics of the textbooks. They often explained the life and dedication of a scientist before they started explaining the intricacies of the topic. Sometimes they used to take us to the physics labs and explain how something works. I have learned numerous aspects of physics - from the simple definition of mass to the complex explanation of Einstein's Theory of Relativity, from those discussions and lectures. My foundation of physics was built at that time and later extended with the help of those teachers.\n\nThe subject itself is utterly interesting if someone has passions for it. Physics is a subject that seems difficult at first but one would start loving it if s/he starts to understand the underlying concepts of it. Physics is all around us and the lessons I learned from my school had helped me greatly throughout my academic years."

    "Answer": "English as a subject is taught in almost every school in my country. I have enjoyed learning about the grammatical aspects, vocabulary, phrases and origin of words from the very beginning of my academic life and I still enjoy learning it. I would like to thank you for letting me talk about the subject I always loved in my school.\n\nI have been taught this subject by many teachers in different classes but I remember Ms Elizabeth the most for her amiable personality and exceptional teaching method. I still remember my English teacher in the fifth grade of my elementary school and she was so full of energy. This very teacher was Ms Elizabeth and she was from Australia and as a native English teacher, she did not know our language. I believe this was an advantageous aspect for us as we were forced to communicate with her in English.\n\nI will never forget how influential a teacher she was and how her teaching methods have helped us learn the language. She often told us stories and inspired us to write our own narratives. This has greatly helped us develop our writing skills. She did not force us to memorise as many vocabularies and grammatical rules as possible. Rather she prepared study materials so that we could enjoy our lessons and learn from it by actively participating in interesting activities. While we were afraid to talk to most other teachers in our school, we were very attached to her and she had has a great influence on us as a teacher. Due to the lack of speaking and listening lessons, I had trouble in those areas but once Ms Elizeth emerged as my teacher, I improved considerably.\n\nI remember myself as a very attentive pupil in school, so I learned fast and was one of the favourite students of Ms Elizabeth. I firmly recall how she built my love for the language and I owe her a lot for that. I feel extremely lucky to have had an amazing teacher who introduced us to the English culture while teaching us the language.\n\nEnglish is the most powerful and most widely accepted international language and I have been tremendously benefitted from it. My higher study at an international university was possible due to my knowledge of English. Without knowing it, I would never have been in this stage of life. I have many good friends who are not from my country. Without knowing English, this would not have been possible as well. English itself is full of fascination and adventure if one has a passion for it. English is a basic living necessity these days, especially when we are away from our country, and is used all around the world. The skills that I have acquired from my school had helped me greatly throughout my life and it is still helping."

    "Answer": "In the distant past, I have always thought of visiting a museum as a boring thing and just a waste of time. But, I had to change my opinion about it, as I felt really good and informed, after visiting one of the largest museums in my country called “...(Your country name)... National Museum about a year ago or so.\n\n...(Your country name)... national museum is a multidisciplinary museum which has some rare collections from several disciplines such as history, archaeology, arts and natural history. After entering the museums, I could see the first ten galleries very much dedicated to the natural heritage of my country, having displayed collections like “flora and fauna” like cereals, pulses & lentils, various insects and birds, herbal medicinal plants, sea life of our country, rare geographical specimens of deer, tigers and so on. The galleries also contain dioramas of birds and mammals in their natural habitats along with a large skeleton of a giant whale sawfish and different types of beehives, butterflies and reptiles among other things.\n\nThe Museum also has a history and classical art section that displays such as ancient and medieval coins, different kinds of terracotta that were used for wall decoration in the medieval architectures. Hand axes, potteries, magnificent stone and bronze sculptures, fascinating ancient architectural specimens, ancient inscriptions and coins, manuscripts, historical documents, medals and miniature paintings are also some of the collections that are displayed in this museum in order to remind us about our glorious artworks.\n\nAnyway, the experience of visiting the museum was multi-dimensional as it didn’t only allow me to learn about many unknown and interesting facts about my country but also encouraged me to dig even deeper into some other aspects of our history and achievements that are largely ignored. Besides, the visit also allowed me to have some interesting conversation with a number of my fellow countrymen as well as international visitors who surprisingly had a lot more knowledge about my country than me! Finally, visiting the museum made me realize that we should always appreciate and remember our history, no matter how turbulent it may be, because our “past” failure and success are what made us the “nation” or “community” we are today."

    "Answer": "I have visited more than ten museums in total in different countries and enjoyed visiting the (tell a museum name you know about) in (say the country name) the most. I went to the museum almost two years ago while we had been in (...the city name...). Visiting the museum was not a part of our original tour plan, but we went there as it was prominently expressing its presence to us when we visited the area for a different reason. I went there with two of my friends and a cousin who accompanied me during the tour. My cousin and one of my friends were not interested to visit the museum as they had other plans. I insisted them to go there and convinced them by saying that if you do not enjoy it, I would pay for dinner!\n\nAfter we bought our tickets, we entered the museum and the colossal front of the museum and the stunning garden in front of it mesmerised us. At that very time, I realised that the inside would be more astonishing.\n\nOnce inside, we realised that the place was far larger than we initially thought it would be. There were five floors in the museum and the interior of the building reminded us of the imperial age. We could see the ceiling of the building from the ground floor. People from different age groups and nationalities were closely observing the museum and I had a feeling that most of them were enjoying it. Taking photos was prohibited and yet I was sometimes lured to take some snaps especially when I saw the colossal dinosaur fossil and the alien ship!\n\nThe first floor of the museum had some artworks from a few famous artists around the world and sculptures from different epochs in history. The first floor gave us the impression of visiting a theatre or an art gallery rather than a museum. We came to know that some of the arts were so expensive that one could buy an island by selling it! Then we ascended to the second floor which was filled with the Second World War memoirs. Guns, tanks, documents, and other war materials from 1945 WW II had been on display there. A video documentary was showing some of the real events from World War ||.\n\nWhen we reached the third floor, it’s been already 2 and a half hours. We found that many costumes and traditional items from different parts of the world have been placed there. One can easily learn about the customs of different ages and countries just by visiting this floor. The next floor had more adventure and surprises waiting for us. It has placed all the major inventions of different ages. I was overwhelmed when I saw the first computer ever built, speedboat, the wheel, motor engine and a few famous inventions of history on this floor. I was so much dying to touch the first four-wheeler that had been placed there!\n\nWe spent almost the whole day inside this museum. We were so enthralled to visit the place that we literally forgot to have our lunch. The overall experience was fantastic and I learned so many things in a few hours. As soon as I left the place, I planned to revisit it someday."

    "Answer": "I am really grateful to you for allowing me to talk about my experience of visiting a museum, and for this topic, I would like to tell you about the British Museum which I visited a year ago. The experience was superb and I will never forget the rich collection this museum has.\n\nI went to visit my elder sister and her family in the UK in 2018 and I was lucky that my sister took me to the British Museum. Established in 1753, the British Museum is located in London, in the United Kingdom and it is considered the first national public museum in the world. It has more than 4 million works and the collection is awe-inspiring.\n\nThe British Museum is massive and overwhelming. Once I reached there, I was fascinated by its exterior and building. Once inside, I got lost in history. I could not believe that a museum could preserve the entire human history- from the very beginning until the present. It's extraordinary collection spans over two million years of human history and culture. Over 7 million visitors every year, it is one of the most famous museums in the world. The Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon sculptures, Aztec Double-Headed Serpent Egyptian mummies, the Elgin Marbles, and the Lewis Chessmen that I saw were remarkable. Before visiting this museum, I did not know how massive a museum and its collection could be. The museum also epitomizes the long British traditions of exploration, quirkiness and obsessive collecting. I felt like I could spend weeks there! I thanked my sister for taking me to the museum.\n\nWhile I was there, I felt like I was taken to an alien planet! After an hour or so, I felt like I had been travelling in a time machine and the history was happening in front of me! At a time when my sister urged me that we should leave, I felt like I still had so many things to see. I told myself \"I will return here again and enjoy the remaining collection if I ever visit the UK again\".  I can tell you that, this is a \"must-visiting place\" if you ever visit the UK. To me, it is the best museum I have ever been to."

    "Answer": "There are movies which we watch and then forget about them completely after a few days, if not any sooner. Then, there are movies like “Forrest Gump”, which we never exactly get tired of watching again and again because they make us think and experience our lives in some new lights.\n \nA simple-minded (some would say with “low IQ”), but kind-hearted, Alabama boy, named “Forrest Gump” grows up with his best friend - a beautiful girl called Jenny. His supportive mother teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny.\n\nForrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends, winning medals, starting multi-million dollar shrimp fishing business, writing bumper stickers and songs, donating to people, meeting the president several times and doing many other things. However, this all becomes irrelevant to Forrest because he can’t seem to save his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life.\n \nThe underlying theme of the movie is that it advises a person to run from all the negative thoughts, influences and bullies of life as fast as he can, no matter how others around him try to “degrade” him physically and intellectually.\n\nWhy do I like the movie so much? Well, I like this movie primarily because it teaches us to find out on our own what exactly life is all about instead of paying attention to what others say about it. Besides, I like this movie also because it asks us to show “respect” to people, who seem rather “simplistic” in their thoughts and actions, because they also have their own dreams, and that they also chase their dreams very successfully in life. Finally, I like this movie also because of some of its “simple yet powerful” dialogues (ie. \"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get.\"), which are really difficult to forget."

    "Answer": "The name of my favourite movie is 'Casablanca' which was directed by Michael Curtiz. It was released in 1943 and the story was adapted from a stage-play named 'Everybody comes to Ricks'. The movie starred Humphery Bogart & Ingrid Bergman and was made in the USA. It was a romantic drama film and the storyline was set during World War II.\n\nIt focuses on a man torn between love and virtue. In 1941 American expatriate Rick who professed to be neutral by all means met his former lover Ilsa in his nightclub and gambling den. She was accompanied by her husband, Laszlo, a renowned fugitive Czech Resistance Leader. They needed a letter to escape to America, where he can continue his work against the Nazis. German Major came to Casablanca to see that Laszlo does not succeed. One night Ilsa confronted Rich in the deserted cafe and asked for the letter. She threatened him with a gun for the letter and later on confessed that she still loved him. Rick's bitterness dissolved learning that Ilsa was married to Laszlo before even their relationship began. When Rick and Ilsa planned to fly together, she could not do so because all of a sudden she found that her husband was still alive and needed her badly to recover. Hearing the story Rick calmed down and agreed to give the letter to Laszlo so that he can fly to America safely. They would take a different path to fly away together. But finally, Rick let Ilsa and Laszlo fly to America which surprised Ilsa very much.\n\nIn 1989, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry a being deemed 'Culturally', 'Historically' and 'Aesthetically' significant. It is the second-best movie of all time based on AFI's 100 best movies of all time.\n\nI've seen the movie more than 2-3 times. The story is excellent, the casting, plot, acting, dialogues and all other aspects of the movie are superb. The movie deeply touched me and became the most favourite movie I have ever seen."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for letting me talk about this cue card topic. Interestingly, I initially thought that it would be so easy to talk about my favourite movie but then I realised it is not because there are so many things to talk about but the time is limited! However, I will try.\n\nWell, my favourite movie is 'Citizen Kane', - an American mystery drama by Orson Welles which is often considered the best movie ever made. Orson Welles was also its director, producer, co-screenwriter, and the protagonist. This movie won an Academy Award for Original Screenplay and I believe the screenplay of the movie makes it so distinctive and brilliant. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the greatest film ever made, Citizen Kane is especially appreciated for its cinematography, music, editing and narrative structure, which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting.\n\nOrson Welles's epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall is entertaining, poignant, and inventive in its storytelling, earning its reputation as a landmark achievement in the movie industry. When a reporter is assigned to decipher newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane's dying words, his investigation gradually reveals the fascinating portrait of a complex man who rose from obscurity to staggering heights. Though Kane's friend and colleague Jedediah Leland and his mistress, Susan Alexander shed fragments of light on Kane's life, the reporter fears he may never penetrate the mystery of the elusive man's final word, \"Rosebud.\"\n\nThe film was absolutely a masterpiece and I had several reasons to like it. Acting, production, cinematography, music, editing and narrative structure, which have been considered innovative and trend-setting, are the main reasons anyone would enjoy this movie. It's a kind of movie that we do not watch quite often and for me, I consider it the best movie I have ever watched.\n\nAt the end of the movie, the reporter - who was assigned to reveal Kane's last word, concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word, \"Rosebud\", and it will forever remain a mystery. As the film ends, the camera reveals that \"Rosebud\" is the trade name of the sled on which the eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado. Thought to be junk by Xanadu's staff, the sled is burned in a furnace. The innocence of childhood and happiness in simple thing are incomparable and often hold the secret of life, is something I learned from the movie."

    "Answer": "Describing a unique country, without ever visiting it, is always going to be a difficult proposition for a person who has very little or no imagination power. But, fortunately, since I have learnt a lot about it by watching TV and reading many travel journals/ magazines, I think that I should be able to do it just fine. So, please bear with me. Thank you.\n\nI am talking about Greece here - a beautiful southern European and peninsular country, situated by the Mediterranean Sea, and located between Turkey and Albania – which I have always wanted to visit since the very first day I started to learn about. With its long and beautiful coastline along with the Mediterranean Ocean, this country attracted more than 30 million tourists in the year 2018.\n\nSo, why have I always wanted to visit this country? Well, to start with, this country has a perfect climate condition with perfect temperatures and sunshine every season throughout the entire year. I would also like to visit this country because it has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, with its green and luscious valleys, turquoise seas, incredible islands (in fact, 3000 of them) and unique mountain ranges, which surely would take our breath away. Besides, I also want to see the beautiful Acropolis, which is thought to have been built for the “goddess Athena” in Athens and its stunning museum.\n\nGreece is a good country to visit mainly because it has some of the most unique and oldest civilizations in the world. Besides, it is very easy for people to fall in love with Greece because of its simple beauties where one is able to enjoy his or her life without any complication. Greece also has some of the lowest crime rates in the world which makes this country one of the safest to visit. Finally, a very warm and high level of hospitality of the Greek people, along with the unique, healthy and delicious food at an affordable price, makes Greece one of the best holiday destinations in the world, and I am planning to visit this great country some times in the year of 2021!"

I've been dreaming of visiting this country for more than five years and ironically an attempt to visit Italy was cancelled two years ago. I'll definitely visit the country as soon as my graduation is complete.\n\nItaly is in Southern Europe. Rome, the largest city and the Capital of Italy has been the leading political and religious centre of the western civilisation, serving as the capital of both the Roman Empire and Christianity. I'd like to go there to see the great museums, historic monuments and structures, cultural and other attractions and above all to get an impression of an Italian way of life. Another reason I want to go there is to visit the Vatican City. I have read and heard numerous historical facts about this country and witnessing them would be a great joy for me. There are plenty of things to see- arts, museums, Colosseum, Leaning Tower of Pissa, Roman Forum, Florence Cathedral, St. Peter's Basilica, Milan Cathedral, Sistine Chapel, Piazza San Marco, Circus Maximus and lots of other places I'd love to visit.\n\nItaly was one of the most advanced territories once and this country still has lots of historically significant places to visit. I've read about those places so many times and heard stories from many of my friends that visiting this country has become a big wish for me. And I'm pretty positive about visiting this country next year after I finish university."

    "Answer": "I never really like to consider myself as a “party animal”, but I don’t really mind attending a party once in a while, especially, when I become a bit more “burned out” than usual from my job. So, a few months ago, when I got an invitation from a friend to celebrate his new job, offered by one of the prestigious accounting firms in my country, I just couldn’t wait to attend the party!\n\nBut, before that special day actually arrived, my friend had to wait almost one agonizing year, after quitting his last job, as he had to go through numerous job interviews one after another. So, when the good news had arrived, my friend immediately decided to celebrate at one of the biggest hotels in his home town because he wanted to invite all of his friends and classmates from his high school and university as well as all of his family members and relatives. Besides, he also wanted the occasion to be really special because it was his ‘dream job’ that he was celebrating, for which, he studied and worked really hard for years.  \n\nSo, anyway, everybody, invited to the party, started to get busy talking and laughing with each other while enjoying some drinks and snacks, as soon as they arrived in the evening. I, along with my old school and university friends, got busy catching up with each other’s life story of the past years during which we didn’t get to meet. We also enjoyed a special music show by one of our local musical bands. Some of the guests even joined the music band to display their “musical talent” which was refreshing and entertaining. Finally, it was time for us to enjoy the food which, I must say, was cooked and made to perfection. In fact, there were just so many different kinds of dishes that one just had no choice but to satisfy his or her appetite completely. Anyway, having said and done everything, it was a great party at the end of the day, and everybody left the hotel with some great memories in their minds."

    "Answer": "Today I’m going to tell you about a particular party I attended earlier this year. I’ll tell you where it was held, who was present at the party and what I was up to whilst I was there!\n\nHonestly speaking, I can be a bit grumpy about going to parties!  I never know what to wear as I don’t really like dressing up for parties. I feel self-conscious in dresses and too much of a scruff if I don’t make an effort. I worry about whether I’ll know anyone, and I dread sit-down meals because I’m a vegetarian and I always seem to be a problem. This being so when a close friend of mine announced she would have a big celebration for her fiftieth birthday, my heart sank a bit. Of course, I put on a smile, and said ‘that’s great!’ but I wasn’t really looking forward to it. I knew that it was important to her, though, so I was determined to make a real effort, and of course, I agreed I would go.\n\nWell, I should have had more faith. The party was great. It was held in a beautifully converted barn in a rural location on the edges of Sheffield in England. The venue had a wooden polished floor and was very simply decorated with some tastefully positioned fairy lights and candles. There was low-level music playing and lots of places to sit and chat or mingle with other guests. If I remember correctly, there were white tablecloths over the tables and some simple but lovely floral decorations. The food was provided by a friend of the Birthday Girl, who specialises in fast street food. You could queue up for a delicious meal presented in a wrap from a very jolly woman serving from an open-sided vehicle parked in the cobbled courtyard outside.  In a separate annexed room inside was a table almost collapsing under the weight of delicious home-made cakes and puddings on one side, and glorious British cheeses on the other. There was also a small bar serving drinks, for which my host picked up the bill at the end, it was beautifully done – very tasteful, calm and joyful too.\n\nMy friend, whose birthday it was, has a really wide network of friends. She decided to invite anyone and everyone from her social circle. So there were old school friends; people she knew from her voluntary activities with scouts; fellow runners – she is very active in a number of running clubs. Former work colleagues; people she’d come to know just from waiting with other parents at the school gates when her children were little; fellow entrepreneurs (she runs her own small business) as well as neighbours and acquaintances from every area of her life.\n\nBefore I went, I was worried about whether I’d know anyone else there. I hadn’t been living in the area for all that long before being invited, and so I was a bit hesitant about what to expect. I should have remembered what a good judge of character my fantastically friendly friend is! What did I do at the party? Apart from eating my body weight in delicious food, I met and talked to many interesting people that I might otherwise never have come across!  This included the self-employed interior designer, marathon runners, a former Bluebell girl, artists, writers, medical doctors, IT workers, academics and students. It was a remarkable cross-section of fascinating folk. I had a wonderful time.\n\nWhat’s more, I discovered that actually, I did know quite a few people there after all. It was great fun trying to discover how we all came to be there and what connected each of us to the – \"hostess with the mostest\" to coin the old phrase! I am almost won over. Next time she offers to host a party, I might even find myself looking forward to it, you never know."

My university friends invited me to join the party and I thought it would be fun to be there. It was held at a 3-star hotel where the teachers, students and a few of their relatives were present.\n\nA week before the New Year eve, one of my friends called on my mobile phone and informed me that I am expected to be present at the party. On the day, when the party was supposed to take place, I took a taxi to reach the hotel. The name of the hotel was (..say a name you prefer...) and it was one of the best hotels in our town, renowned for its hospitality and delicious food. After I reached the hotel, I found that it had been gorgeously decorated and most of my friends from university and some of the teachers were already enjoying the party. We gathered on the 2nd floor and the vibrant atmosphere and melodious music were breathtaking. A local music band performed at the party and people were dresses adequately for the party except for a few friends of mine who do not care much about dressing up for the occasion.\n\nI enjoyed the performance of the music band and sat at a corner most of the time. I was not really in a mood to blend in and cheer up most of the time. Rather, I was thinking about my New Year resolutions and enjoying the colourful gathering all around me. I did, however, enjoyed the meal and drinks and I loved a few continental dishes the hotel served us. When the clock ticked at the \"zero hour\" everybody became ecstatic and started exchanging new year wishes. I also talked to a teacher who was at the party and then sat on a couch to enjoy the lively ambience around me. If I remember correctly, I stayed at the party till 2.00 am and then returned to my room after enjoying one of the most fabulous parties in my whole life."

Among them, I'd like to talk about Mr Smith, who has been an extraordinary teacher, a really good mentor and who has a great influence on my studies.\n\nI met Mr Smith for the first time when I was in fourth grade. He was our math teacher. Initially, we thought that he would be a tough teacher and we would have to be very polite in front of him. We got this impression mostly because of his serious face and tidy dress-up. But soon we found that he was a very friendly person and we did not have to be \"very polite\" with him. He never made things complicated and tried over and over again to explain something to us. He had a unique way of teaching and could explain complex topics very easily. Thus everything we learned from him was interesting and that's why we remember most of the theories and techniques of math he taught us.\n\nI'd say he has a great influence on my education because he helped me build a strong foundation in mathematics. My major in college was science and mathematics was the most important subject at that level. I have always been good at math and that' mainly because of Mr Smith who had a major role in making the subject interesting to me. Before I learned math from Mr Smith, my impression on math was not good and I considered mathematics to be a complex and uninteresting subject. But his teaching and influences changed my way of thinking about math and later on, math became my one the most favourite subjects for which I admire him greatly."

He asked me why I needed to see him, and I said that I was having a tough time understanding one of his physics lessons. Inspecting the “little me” with a great smile on his face, Mr Tyler told me to see him the next day as if he was expecting this kind of “trouble” at the end of his class!\n\nAnyway, I had to oblige and saw him the next day as per the schedule. And, it took one of my favourite teachers, if not the most favourite, of all time only about 30 seconds to explain the entire lesson as clearly as the water of Lake Mashu in Japan. Having received an award for the “teacher of the year”, a couple of years ago, Mr Tyler wasn’t just good at teaching Physics, but also was equally adept at teaching Chemistry and Biology. In fact, very rarely have I seen a teacher explaining difficult lessons/things at such ease! My Tyler sir, indeed, was a special teacher not only because of his “depth of knowledge” in his subjects but also because of his great helping attitude.\n\nI still remember how my favourite teacher encouraging us for “private lessons” to study and understand science so that we could take our country forward with our talents and hard works. In fact, it was because of the constant push and encouragement of my dear teacher that I got admission in one of the most prestigious engineering colleges in my country. Being a great mentor both inside and outside of my school, Mr Tyler never hesitated to admonish us if we ever failed to do things on time. Million thanks to him, for he has truly inspired me to be the better person that I am today!"

He was my mentor and with his direct supports and suggestions, I have crossed many of the barriers of my life - both academic and personal. So, I am really grateful to him and have been greatly inspired by his teaching techniques. If he did not guide me in my education, I think I would not be able to arrive in this position today. This is a delightful cue card topic and I would like to thank you for this topic.   \n\nMr John Markus was the teacher of general science in the school. He was really a great teacher and used to teach in some unconventional methods. He hardly used books or other teaching materials for teaching in the classroom. He also had some other techniques to impress the students. And most importantly, he knew all the names of his students which I had never seen before.\n\nHe was special in the sense that he knew how to teach the students. Mr Markus also supported his students in some other matters and mentored like his own children. The other most important thing about him is that he used to keep in touch with the parents of the children. He Regularly updated the parents with the latest information about their kids. As a result, he turned into a popular figure among the parent community.  \n\nI and my education have been influenced by this person to a great extent. He had some special ways to complete things. He was straightforward and never turned biased to any of his students. He loved all the kids like his own children which attracted me most. Whenever I met him with some sort of troubles, he guided me the way out of them. So, I like him much."

Since then, I didn’t really see him until, of course, one day I met him about a couple of years ago at a local fish market where I live. I could barely recognize him after more than 15 years as he had become a “big man” in his mid 20’s by then. In fact, I would probably have never recognized him unless his uncle, the only relative of him I knew, was kind enough to introduce him to me after so many years, leaving me completely speechless and ecstatic!\n\nAfter meeting Ivan, my childhood friend, with whom I got along nicely until the day he left our home town, we both wanted to visit each other as often as possible in an effort to renew our friendship.  But, because of the long distance between us, it wasn’t really possible. So, the only time we could meet is when I travel to his city in order to do some shopping, which seldom more than once a month.\n\nBeing the only child of his parents, Ivan could be moody and demanding sometimes. Having a reserved personality, Ivan told me that he didn’t really have many friends except me and a few others from his college.  \n\nI like spending time with Ivan mainly because he is very serious about his life and career. Besides, I could trust him like a brother with my life since my childhood as he would never reveal our “secrets” (friends have “secrets”. Don’t they?). In fact, he treats me more like a brother than a friend, since he doesn’t have any siblings, advising me at every opportunity to take good care of my elderly parents, which I really appreciate. Finally, I like to spend time with Ivan because he appreciates and understands the value of my time, and that not too many people would befriend him because of his introvert personality (even though he is a great person once you get to know him)."

We often exchange our thoughts about books and politics.\n\nI like to spend time with him because we have many common interests. I never feel bored spending time with him. Since we are friends for a long time, we understand each other very well. A good friend always extends helping hands when we are in need, and Steven does it always for me and for others. We do so many fun stuff together and help each other in our studies. Good friendship, understanding and common interests make us close friends and those are the primary reasons I like to spend time with him so much."

    "Answer": "I happened to meet this person who later became my friend in a yoga and meditation class which I joined lately. It was quite a chance that this person who goes by the name \"Gajender\" sat beside me during the class.\n\nAfter these classes, it has been quite a regular feature that we spend time together, almost every weekend. Yet another reason why I like spending time with Gajender is the humorous character that he possesses.\n\nI always find him in a jubilant mood in spite of the fact that he went through some troublesome experience in life. He lost his only son and that too at a young age of 25. I must say, he is one of the persons who has really made a positive impression on my mind and has contributed a lot in the way I have started looking at life.\n\nThe reason why I like spending time with him is the positive vibes that I feel out of him. He is one of the persons, rather the first person in my life, who has a very positive attitude towards life."

    "Answer": "We meet new people every day. We tend to remember some of them while we tend to forget the others. And then, there are those who become our friends against all kinds of odds. But, that’s exactly what happened when Elliot and I accidentally became friends a few years ago or so. I met him at an intercollegiate football match competition where he was cheering for his college team, and I was cheering for mine, sitting next to each other.\n\nBeing fans of two rival teams, facing off each other in the field, we didn’t exactly need to talk to each other unless, of course, we were arguing for something, and an argument it really was after a goal was scored against Elliot’s team with him arguing how a “foul” was made against his side before the goal was scored.\n\nAnyway, at the start of our argument, I was trying to “defend” my team with some “lame excuses”, but having seen him how much he really cared about his “losing” side, I decided to agree with him to his delight. And, the immediate result of such “reconciliation” was the start of an enduring “friendship” with a great gesture of sharing “peanuts” with each other until the match was over. Elliot didn’t forget to tell me where he lived, or what he studied either before leaving our college stadium (which he really liked because of its big size).\n\nAfter that little “encounter” at our football stadium, our friendship between me and Elliot is still great and alive, having him visit me and my family once in a while as we don’t really live very far from each other. But instead of hitting the football stadium these days, we actually talk more about our careers, future plans, and, of course, the places we would like to travel in future. In fact, if things are rolled out according to our plans, we will actually get to set up a little cafeteria at a local airport which is conveniently located between my home town and that of Elliot’s. However, the best thing about this friendship perhaps (at least, my little younger brother thinks so) is receiving farm-fresh pineapples in courier from Elliot every year. Next month, I and Elliot are planning to visit the biggest sea resort in my country which I have always dreamt of."

    "Answer": "Though I have many friends, my friendship with them took time and mutual understanding to grow. But my friendship with George started almost all of a sudden. I am grateful to you for this nice cue card topic and would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about it.\n\nGeorge is senior to me by 2/3 years and I did not meet him until I was in the 4th semester at my University. One of my term final exam schedules was changed and I did not know about it. According to my previous exam schedule, I reached the university and was totally confused about what to do when I heard that the exam was already over two days ago!\n\nI went to our departmental head's office and he could not find a way around it. He criticised me for not knowing the schedule change and asked me rather abruptly what could be done about it, and I had no idea about it! I explained to him that I was sick and did not come to the university for 4-5 days and that made me unaware of the new schedule. Then I found that someone who was sitting next to me in the departmental head's office asked me to meet the course teacher and explain the situation to him. He then escorted me to this teacher's room and talked to him for a while. It seemed to me that George was already personally known to our teacher and they had an intimate relationship. Hearing everything the teacher agreed to arrange an exam for me the next day in his office room.\n\nMy friendship with George began after that event and albeit our age difference, we found that we had many common interests and passions. We started spending time together and during the next few months, I visited his house many times. We worked in a retail shop together for nearly eight months and that helped us become more intimate.\n\nGeorge is now staying in the USA and we do not meet each other in person. But we talk often over the phone and we regularly let each other know our updates. Despite the distance, we still value and care for our friendship."

    "Answer": "I am going to tell you about my first ‘best friend’ from childhood.  I’ll explain how we met, how long we were friends, what we got up to and why I liked her so much, and I’ll try and explain our friendship so you can understand why we were so close.\n\nI first met my friend Tracey when I went to junior school.  We were sat next to each other in class, I don’t think we chose to do that particularly, we probably just sat where we were told to on our first day of the school year, but we got on straight away and were firm friends from the age of about 8 until we left school to go to senior school, aged about eleven. We happened to go to different schools at that point, and sadly our friendship drifted apart, when we were younger though, we were inseparable.\n\nTracey and I had similar interests.  We liked being outside, we liked horses (although neither of us went riding or had access to ponies back then), we enjoyed doing craft type activities (although she was really talented creating amazing pictures and artwork, whilst I just got stuck at the stage of colouring in!)  My main memory is of us heading off together on our bikes for hours and hours at a time.  She lived quite near a large park, so I used to cycle to her house, and then we’d go to the park together with a picnic lunch and spend all day playing games together.  I’m embarrassed now to think how we galloped around pretending to be horses or whatever the game of the day was, but it was fun at the time.  We used to try hula hooping and skipping too, seeing who could hold up a hoop for the longest of skip without stopping using a rope.  I have a feeling she was more accomplished than me at both these activities too.  Sometimes we would try to find and catch grasshoppers (we always let them go) or we would just laze in the sun until it was time to go home.  It was very different then. There were no mobile phones, and people were much more relaxed about letting their children go off and play all day, I’m not sure if you could still do that. Still, we were very happy and used to come back to her house tired and hot and sunburnt, and if we were lucky her mum would give us lemonade to drink and sometimes cheese salad rolls for tea.  Happy memories indeed!\n\nIn terms of why we liked each other, well we just did!  We enjoyed doing the same things, we could talk about anything to each other – complaining about schoolwork or annoying parents and other such troublesome worries of the time.  She had pet rabbits, and I had pet guinea pigs, so looking after our pets was a shared interest too.  It probably helped that we lived quite close to each other and both had bikes too.  We also both had a vivid imagination, it meant we could have remarkable adventures together pretending to inhabit whole new worlds that we had invented for ourselves.\n\nWe kept in touch for a while, but both eventually moved on.  I think she went on to become an artist of some renown, which was not surprising given her early talent for art.  Whatever she does and wherever she ended up I hope she is happy and successful too, and I will always remember her as a brilliant companion from when I was young, I wonder if she remembers me too."

    "Answer": "Getting to talk about our “old” time friends is refreshing as it is warming and comforting, especially, if they are our childhood friends. So, I would like to thank you for offering me the opportunity to talk about one of my childhood friends as it brings back a lot of good memories.\n\nHis name was “Eric Sunny”, and I met him at an inter-district school football (soccer) competition when a number of football teams from different districts arrived at my school in order to play against each other. Anyway, Eric was the star player of one of our opponent teams, and I wanted to get some friendly tips on playing good football in general from him. After meeting with Eric, I have remained a friend with him until this day even though we don’t really get together with each other even remotely as often as we did during our school days.\n\nDuring the early days of our friendship, Eric used to come to visit me from his town, just as I also used to visit his hometown, in order to do a variety of activities, such as flying kites, swimming and fishing in the lakes, hanging out at restaurants and café, watching movies and, of course, also playing football occasionally. Sometimes, we also used to travel to different interesting places in our country during our summer vacations and other long holidays.  I liked Eric for a number of reasons, but his positive and helping attitude is what makes him stand out from the crowd.  \n\nBoth I and Eric had a great friendship as we both liked each other with great respect and understanding. Besides, we almost never had any disagreement over anything even though we held separate views on an array of issues. Eric was a true sportsman, and he always used to encourage me to try harder and succeed since I was a bit “lazy” person for his liking. However, the great thing about our friendship was that we both were treated as a “family” member to each other’s family."

    "Answer": "Childhood has its speciality and magic and sometimes childhood friends are unforgettable. One such friend I recall was Masud who I still remember. Our friendship lasted only for a year and after that, he moved to a different city with his parents. I met him on our first day of school. I was late for school due to bad traffic and when I reached my classroom, I thought that all of the seats have been occupied and I was desperately looking for a place to sit. The class teacher asked my name and announced to make a seat for me. I found that one of the boys was asking me to go over there and sit beside him. This very boy was Masud and I was grateful to him.\n\nIn the tiffin time, I shared my foods with him and talked about lots of things. From that next day, we started sitting next to each other and our friendship began to flourish. I found that he collects stamps as a hobby and I was excited to find this common hobby between us. We were very close friends and after one year I heard that he would be moving to a new city as his father has been transferred there. I did not know his postal address and as a consequence, I could not communicate him. We did not meet each other after that but he was such a good and close friend that I still miss him sometimes.\n\nWe did a lot of interesting and fun stuff together. At school, we played footballs and other games in the interval period. We made kites and flew them together, we went to many places to buy stamps, we went to the library to read books, we went to the river to swim, we climbed in trees, we played crickets, we walked in the streets and told stories to each other and did many other things together.\n\nHe was a lively and helpful boy who liked me very much. We had many things in common and we helped each other with our studies. Since I enjoyed participating in different activities with him, I liked him as a friend as well. We had a strong bonding and intimate friendship between us. We tried to help each other whenever needed."

    "Answer": "Speeches are funny things!  Some people are really good at public speaking, and others just aren’t.  I think it is very difficult to talk in front of other people in an engaging way but when people do this really well, then you remember the occasion and how you felt at the time too.  Obviously, really bad speeches can be memorable too, but I’m not going to talk about any of those today.\n\nI want to tell you about a short speech I heard in a work context, I’ll tell you who gave the speech, what it was about and why I think it was so good.\n\nThe speech was given by a manager in a place I was working.  He was giving a speech to say goodbye to one of our colleagues who was leaving to set up as an independent consultant, but who had worked at the organisation a very long time, perhaps forty years.  Everyone was sad to see this person go, as they were very popular, but we all wished them well and understood why they felt they needed to move on.  It was a reasonably big workforce, so about sixty of us had gathered in the open-plan office to say goodbye and present a gift to our departing friend and co-worker.\n\nI think sometimes ‘leaving do's’ can be really awkward and embarrassing  Everyone stands around self-consciously and there is an excruciating and brief ‘goodbye and thank you’ from the boss, and then everyone stares at the poor person who is leaving whilst they rip open and read a rapidly bought card and mumble their thanks for a rather anonymous gift. This, however, was different.  Our manager had made a real effort to prepare a good speech that was funny, well-researched, engaging and genuinely affectionate.  For example, one of the things he did, was going back to our colleague's original application form and he put together a quiz for all of us to do, in which we had to guess what hobbies and qualifications they had declared all that time ago.  It was a great way to ‘break the ice’ and involve everyone, and the results were hilarious.  Even the colleague who was leaving was amazed at the contents of his original form.  He also thanked the colleague for some very specific work that he had done and read out comments from others that he had been collecting over the last couple of weeks which were mini testimonials and statements of appreciation from other colleagues.\n\nI think the speech was good because it involved everyone, shared funny (but not too private) stories that were relevant to the leaver and the effort our boss had put into preparing it showed his respect and admiration for the colleague who was departing.  The quiz also gave everyone something to talk about, so people could chat and mingle a bit after the presentation. It was also not too long!  It held interest and was appropriate for the context.\n\nFor me, the speech was a really good example of how to communicate effectively on such an occasion.  It was perfectly judged and helped bring the team together even though someone was leaving, and made me – and others too – feel happy and lucky that we worked in such a caring team."

    "Answer": "I have always appreciated people, who have the “guts” to speak up in front of others and make their voice count, no matter how their views and opinions are received by their audience. But, are all those speeches, we hear, worth the critique? Well, at least, some are because of their “substance”, and today I would like to talk about one such speech.\n\nMr. Sumit from my hometown was long being considered as a “radical” thinker and a social worker because of his “controversial” views and opinions on many issues, and I had the opportunity to learn about some of them on a number of national daily newspapers. However, when it came to his “speech”, I just never got an opportunity to listen to him except once at a town hall meeting when he was speaking about “the menace of public smoking”. Of course, Mr. Sumit presented his speech with enough evidence, data and information in order to show that smoking was not only destroying our health but also affecting our environment very negatively. At one point, the “brave” even advocated for declaring “public smoking” as a “crime”, but I guess that a significant number of people in the audience disagreed with the speaker on this particular point. Anyway, I was quite impressed with the speech of Mr. Sumit as he truly believed what he was saying.\n\nIn conclusion, I really liked the speech mainly because the speaker was very passionate about solving the problem by getting everybody with him on board. Besides, the speech contained more than enough data and information to prove that “public smoking” was really dangerous for our health and the environment. On top of that, the speaker was smart enough, because of his role as an active social worker, to get the audience to agree that they would also take active steps to raise public awareness against public smoking. Finally, I liked the speech because the speaker managed to give even more credence to his speech when he revealed how he gave up his own smoking habit."

    "Answer": "I have heard numerous speeches, lectures, commentaries on various topics and issues throughout different stages of my life and among them, the speech that was given by our primary school teacher on our farewell day is the most influential one and I still vividly recall it. The teacher who gave the speech was Mr Mark Augustine and he was in his late forties at that time. As the fifth-grade school going kids, we did not comprehend quite clearly what was the school farewell all about. We knew that this is going to be our last day at our primary school and we would start our new school soon. Mr Mark was already a revered teacher for his teaching style, good manner, humour and honesty. Rumour had that, he was much more qualified to be a college professor rather than being a primary school teacher.\n\nOn the day, we had our parents present in school and we had been enjoying everything. As part of the farewell speech, Mr Mark approached the stage and started mentioning what funny things we had done in the last 5 years. We as well as our parents started laughing on the things he mentioned. He mentioned how a kid started screaming at the sight of a cockroach, how a kid of class two expressed his friendship to a girl, how we tried to play amid of the class and many more interesting and funny events.\n\nHe then moved on topics that I still hear in my mind. He told how studying is our primary responsibility, how we should listen to our parents, how have we achieved our liberation as a nation, how to respect the Mother Nature and all the honesty and bravery we should possess in our heart. The topics and his way of presenting them vibrated us heavily. I can still remember how the advice came back to my life from time to time. As a kid, the advice and moralities were probably a way to heavy to grasp but I still believe that the speech had a great impact on my life as well as the lives of the other kids who were present there."

    "Answer": "Travelling to interesting places during the holidays certainly is good. But getting to spend a night at a luxury hotel after enjoying a great outdoor during the holidays is even better, and today I would like to talk about the experience of enjoying a few nights at one such hotel.\n\nThe hotel, I am talking about, was located in the district of “Langkawi” which was 30 kilometre off the mainland coast of northwestern Malaysia. I stayed at the hotel about a few years ago when I was visiting to see the beautiful islands in the Andaman Sea mainly because the hotel provided us with complimentary transportation to visit the adjacent areas. It was a luxury hotel of Marriot family, and it had luxury rooms with contemporary and fine dark wood details which were artfully juxtaposed against locally painted images of beautiful nature on the walls. The rooms also included ample seating areas to enjoy the 32” LCD flat-panel televisions, attached with DVD players along with a fully stocked mini-bar and a coffee pot.\n\nAnd as for the views from the hotel, it was simply outstanding as I could overview the beautiful and ancient rainforest, the Mat Chincang Mountains and the beaches of the Andaman Sea just like they were painted in the picture. Not to also mention, of course, the abundant wildlife in the rainforest to play “hide and seek” with us for our amusement.\n\nThe hotel was certainly special because of its unique location from where it was just so easy to view the encore and beautiful nature without actually ever stepping out of it. Another great thing about this hotel was that I didn’t exactly pay a “truckload” of money to stay there. Besides, I don’t think that many hotels in this world provide free transportation every day to take its valuable guests to let them visit interesting places around them. Finally, it would be a great injustice if I don’t mention about the exceptional customer service of the hotel staffs who treated us like their own family."

    "Answer": "Is it cheating if I tell you about a Bed and Breakfast I stayed in rather than a hotel? I’m going to risk it, and tell you all about a place I stayed on holiday, what it was like and why it was so special to me.\n\nMany years ago I lost my job. I’d been covering a post while someone was on maternity leave, but then they came back and I found I didn’t have a job. Anymore! To cheer me up, two good friends of mine suggested we went away for a weekend break. One of them had found a really nice Bed and Breakfast in Anglesey, which is an island off the coast of Wales. Nowadays it doesn’t feel so much like an island anymore because it is permanently attached to the mainland by the very famous ‘Menai Bridge’. She chose the place partly because of its spectacular location – it is surrounded by sea - but also because it was vegetarian (we all were too) and offered horse riding, which was a hobby we had in common.\n\nThe B&B as we call them in the UK, was, well, pretty eccentric. It was a lovely old house, with quirky rooms, dubious cleanliness and an assortment of dogs, cats, hens, ducks, ponies, people – pretty chaotic. From the house, you could see across the Menai Straits, the stretch of sea between Anglesey and the mainland, to the snow-topped mountains of Snowdonia. It was glorious. The proprietor was one of those people who very much spoke her mind but took you as you were, she quickly involved us in life on her smallholding, feeding animals, heading off to the beach and drunkenly putting the world to rights in front of an open fire in the evening.  We walked the dogs, fed the hens and galloped the horses along deserted beaches.\n\nWhen the woman who owned the B&B found I didn’t have a job, she said quite simply ‘well, why don’t you come and work for me?’ I was flabbergasted, I’d never really considered that sort of a job, and I’d come on holiday not looking for employment. I hesitated, but she persisted. ‘If you like it you can stay, if you don’t you can leave – where is the risk in that?’ To cut a long story short, with unusual spontaneity and recklessness I agreed. For the next two years, I worked at the B&B looking after the horses and guests, taking out rides along the beautiful Welsh beaches and enjoying a rural lifestyle. It was brilliant, I learned a lot about animals, people and myself, and had many adventures along the way. I didn’t earn much, but I lived well in a caravan in the middle of a field with hens clucking around outside and ponies scratching their bottoms on the door of my accommodation in the mornings!\n\nSo for me, that remote Anglesey B&B will always be very special, because it introduced me to a different way of living and working, and gave me an appreciation of the countryside that I hadn’t really been able to experience before. I don’t think I’ve ever laughed as much doing a job as I did staying there!"

The Western Hotel is one of the most luxurious hotels with all modern facilities including a swimming pool, tennis court, gym etc. Most of the modern amenities were accumulated at the hotel for its clients. The services were up to the mark while the accommodations system appeared to be one of the greatest. The hotel is always crowded with visitors and most of them are tourists from different countries.\n\nI went there with my university mates to participate in a seminar which was mainly based on “Tourism Business of Bangladesh”. Students had been invited from all over Bangladesh as part of this program. The seminar was held in the hotel hall room. And the ambience of the hall room was quite outstanding. To be honest they have decorated this room very tastefully. Especially I admired their large and gorgeous paintings which were hanging on the walls.\n\nI stayed for about a week in this hotel. I liked the outstanding facilities they offered. The first thing was that the entire building is connected with Wi-Fi and I used the internet for free of costs. Besides, the food in the hotel’s was yummy. They offered varieties of traditional and other continental foods. But most often I ate our local food because I found it very interesting for me. The services I received from the professional staffs were remarkable. In fact, it is a three-star quality hotel so at first, I was a bit nervous about the cost but when I arrived, all of my worries were gone.

I discussed this issue with my parents, but, as usual, they told me that they would discuss the subject with my eldest uncle (since he was considered to be the wisest of all in our family) and after that only, they could offer me any advice. So, the waiting period started, but luckily I didn’t exactly have to wait very long as I received the decision in a letter soon after talking to my parents.\n\nIt was a long letter and contained many important pieces of advice on how to approach life after graduation, but he didn’t forget to suggest me to get a good job because that would allow me to understand where I stood as far as my qualifications, skills and credentials were concerned. He also told me in the letter that I could do my PhD degree at a later time of my convenience.\n\nThe letter was really important to me because I felt absolutely relieved of my confusion and indecision about my future as an adult. Besides, the letter made me feel that no matter how smart and intelligent we really are, it is always better to seek advice from the elderly of our families because they would never let us down even though our own experience and wisdom might betray us sometimes.

I was very sad and very frightened to be in the hospital, and I didn’t really understand what was happening to me or why.  To make things worse I was going to be in a hospital for my eighth birthday.  At that age, I hadn’t ever really received any letters especially for me before and I certainly didn’t expect to receive any post whilst I was ill.  Therefore, it was a wonderful surprise one morning to be given an envelope with my name and address beautifully hand-written on it and bearing a stamp from overseas in the top right-hand corner.  I was so excited!\n\nThe letter was from my Uncle Peter.  He was living in America at the time, and I was in England.  He had sent me a special letter for my birthday.  That was exciting enough, but what he had done amazed and impressed me.  He said he’s wanted to send me a birthday cake, but that wasn’t practical over such a distance, so instead, he drew me a picture of an amazing birthday cake and a whole party with balloons and presents.  So his letter was to wish me a happy birthday, and to cheer me up because it is horrible for anyone to have an operation at any time, let alone on their own birthday when they are just eight years old!\n\nI was in awe!  He was actually quite a good artist, so his illustration was really good, and the letter cheered me up and made me feel so special.  I kept the letter for a long long time, but sadly one day I couldn’t find it anymore, and I think it must have been thrown out at some point.  Even so, I think this letter was the start of a great correspondence between me and my, to me, ‘exotic’ uncle who lived overseas.  He and I continued to exchange letters over the next forty years, right up until the time he died.  His were always hand-written, though mine moved over to being typed, we never resorted to email, so the ritual of a letter thudding through a letterbox and onto the welcoming doormat of the home continued between us long after many others had abandoned such an old-fashioned form of communication.\n\nSo the letter was very important to me because it cheered me up when I felt low and made me feel special.  It also began a correspondence that continued over four decades.  Even today, I still think nothing beats a ‘proper’ letter, and I will always try and send a personal note to friends or family when something important has happened.  I love the excitement of seeing a postmark and an unknown stamp on a newly arrived envelope and the anticipation of wondering who a letter might be from and what they have to say. For me, nothing beats the physicality of a letter in your hands and when I post a letter or card myself I always like to imagine the recipient similarly examining my unopened missive and hopefully looking forward to making a cup of coffee and settling down to enjoy the contents!"

    "Answer": "Finding little leisure time in this modern, tough and complicated world, where we are all so busy, is never an easy proposition. And, this holds true at least for me. So, whenever I manage some leisure time, I make sure that I do make the best use of it by visiting a nearby park.\n\nYes, as I've just mentioned, I like to visit a park, preferably having a lake in it, with some of my friends and neighbours whenever I get an opportunity (by the way, sometimes, I have to go alone because others may have different priorities). I also don’t forget to grab a food basket and a blanket/bed sheet for a lazy feast on the grassy lawn of the park unless, of course, it rains. Finally, accompany with us are some fishing rods and camera as well.\n\nAnyway, once we arrive at the park, the first thing we do is to wander around in it for a while and warm ourselves up for the next big “thing”, which is taking pictures of different kinds of plants, as well as the local animal residents who are never scared to get “cosy” with us. Our picture taking activities, while wandering around, continue until we get tired and hungry. So, we just grab our food and eat them for as long as we could in a very lazy manner by sitting on the grassy park lawns. Food makes us even more tired and lazy, because of eating too much of it, but never tired enough to do our next significant thing, which is to do some fishing in the lake. Needless to say, of course, we seldom catch any fish, not even after making some “valiant” efforts.\n\nI like to spend my leisure time in this way mainly because it perfectly fits with my “laidback” lifestyle. Besides, it allows me to get close to Mother Nature and to enjoy it while also doing some fun and recreational activities. Finally, it helps me recover from the hectic work schedules of a long week."

    "Answer": "I have classes 5 days a week, I attend a diploma course on Computing and I do some tuitions as well and all of those activities and my study make my days busy. However, I maintain some leisure activities and in my day-off, I go through a different routine.\n\nI love to read books and maintain my own blog. Whenever I get time either I read books or write/ moderate my blog. Besides reading and writing for my blog, I play some indoor games with my friends and family members like chess, computer games etc. If it's an outdoor game, I play with my neighbours or friends.\n\nI read books mostly in my study room and sometimes in the nearby library. I work on my computer to update my blogs. I mostly read fictions and historical books. The blog I maintain is mostly technology related and I add the details with images for my blog readers. Two friends of mine are now the moderator of this blog and they contribute to this blog as well.\n\nI like to utilise my leisure time and enjoy very much what I do. Reading books is the most prudent investment of leisure time and I learn many things from reading. Maintaining a blog is a great way of improving the writing and sharing knowledge and that helps me greatly to explore new things as I need to read a lot to generate ideas to write.\n\nThe indoor game like chess is a great way of passing time and it also helps to do some brainstorming. I take part in the outdoor games to both enjoy the game and to keep my body and mind fresh and fit."

    "Answer": "Whether we like it not, we all have to make some important decisions at some points of our lives because they allow us the opportunities not only to grow as a “person”, but also to adapt and adjust our “life strategies” with the demand of time. Today, I would like to talk about one such important decision, which I made about 5 years ago or so.\n\nThe decision was about whether to quit my job or not and then going back to university again in order to obtain an advanced degree, such as an MBA, in “international business”. And, the reason, for which I wanted to obtain an advanced degree, was that I wanted to build my career as a university teacher instead of pursuing a career in the corporate world.\n\nBut, it was not a very easy decision to make for me at that time as I didn’t only have enough funds to pay for my educational expenses, but also I wasn’t confident enough about a good academic performance, after a significant time of study break, which would be a “must” thing to help me get a job as a university faculty member. Not knowing for sure what to do, I sought for some important advice from one of my high school teachers, who was very much like a “mentor” to me, and he told me that I should have gone back to university again. So, I went back to the university again, and in hindsight 20/20, it was one of the best decisions I have ever made so far.\n\nAnyway, it was indeed a very important decision to make because it allowed me to find out my true potentials, both on the intellectual level and professional level, in the subsequent years. In fact, I did get an invitation to work as a teacher at a local university after finishing my advanced degree. Besides, this particular decision made me more confident about my life and future than ever before which was more of an important “gift” for me in itself than prospective career opportunities."

    "Answer": "Decisions, decisions. I’m not always good at making decisions. I worry about making the wrong choices and often seek advice from friends to help me think through the consequences of picking one option over another. Mind you, some people say that we choose who to ask for advice depending on what advice we want to hear. That might be true. Some decisions are easy to make – perhaps because all the possible options are good ones (like choosing a favourite pudding) others seem to have no good options only ‘least bad’ ones, those are hardest to make. The important decision I can think of, and which I’m going to talk about today, worked out in the end, but it was terrifying to have to make at the time.\n\nI’ll talk you through what the decision was, when I took it and what the results were. Finally, I’ll explain why it was so important that it still impacts me today.\n\nThe decision was whether or not I should relocate to a different part of the country to take up a new job. I had to make this decision about 6 years ago. I had been self-employed for a while, but then there was a downturn in the economy and I stopped getting enough work to support myself. I applied for a job in Sheffield, which was a city I didn’t know at all, and when I had first an interview, and then a job offer, I was faced with a big decision. Should I leave my home and friends to start a new life in Sheffield for a promising job at a prestigious university; or should I stay where I was in my lovely house and familiar surroundings, and hope the work might pick up again in the future?\n\nI thought a lot about the pros and cons; I cried a lot to be honest, as the thought of making a new start was really scary. I’d be all on my own, and what if I didn’t make friends or couldn’t do the job well? However, ultimately it came down to income. I couldn’t live on fresh air, and this was a well-paid job. I also thought if I turned the work down, and then didn’t manage to pick up new contracts I’d always wonder ‘what if?’ or how might things have been different if I’d just been brave enough to ‘give it a go!’  I accepted the job and started to pack. In less than three weeks I was renting a flat in a new city and turning up to work in a new office with new colleagues. One resolution I made early on, was to be really positive about the decision once I’d made it. I’d join societies, say ‘yes’ to every social invitation, and really try to build a new life quickly. I wouldn’t ever look back!\n\nThe result of the decision? Well, I moved to a new city and took a new job. It was hard at first, there was a lot to learn and sometimes it was lonely too. However, I’ve never regretted it. Sheffield is a lovely city near to the beautiful countryside. I've rented an attic flat which has great views over the city in one direction and woodland in the other. I think this city must be one of the friendliest ones in the UK, people were incredibly welcoming to me as a newcomer, and there is always lots to do. I don’t have that job anymore, but I don’t regret taking it at all. I do sometimes miss my old house in Leamington where I used to live, but I don’t miss anything else. I think the move revitalised me and took me on a great new adventure, sometimes you do just have to take a bit of a risk in life to progress, this bit of risk-taking worked for me.\n\nSo in conclusion, I think it was a big decision, but I made a good choice. Of course, it was an important one as it changed everything for me, from where I lived and worked, to who my friends are. Honestly, I think perhaps with decisions it matters less what you decide, and more than once you have made a decision you make the best of it, wherever it may take you. Sometimes the journey is speedy and smooth, sometimes it is rocky along the way, but whatever path we choose, it is what makes us the people we are – for better or worse!"

    "Answer": "I've made many decisions in my life and frankly speaking, I have taken those decisions sometimes all alone and sometimes discussing with my parents and others. The particular decision that seems very important to me was the time when I decided to major in Literature rather than major in Engineering. My mother wanted me to get admitted to the Engineering University and do my graduation majoring Engineering while my fascination was studying in Literature. I made this decision when I was 18 years old, just after finishing my 12th grade. My father did not force me to do anything; instead, he told me to do what I thought was best for me. My relatives thought that I was a fool and too immature to make a big decision for myself.\n\nBut after considering several issues and perspective I decided to get myself admitted to a university that offers graduation in literature. I'm happy that I made this decision. I'm yet to finish my graduation but throughout the last 3 years I have enjoyed studying literature and I am doing quite well academically.\n\nMaking the decision/ choice was not easy and I had to go through a hard time as I remember. I had to fight a lot with my inner self and then convince my mother. There were always risks of picking the option I prefer my parents would have complained if I hadn’t made a promising result. I still remember the dubious feelings I had that time. Sometimes it seemed to me that I should abandon my passion and yield to my parents' decision and then again I strongly felt for my own choice and passion. Since I made my own choice at that time, a strong urge and force worked on me that I have to do really good and I am happy that I took my decision and doing very good so far."

    "Answer": "Many Indians, like me, consider “India” as a “land of music”. In fact, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that music is in our blood as there are so many different kinds of musical events in my country. Today, I would like to talk about one such musical event which I also happen to enjoy.\n\nThe name of this musical event is called the “Sunburn Musical Festival”. It is also considered as Asia's biggest electronic music festival. This musical event takes place in the smallest Indian state of Goa, located in the southwestern region of India, every year in December, and continues for three days. The event actually is an amalgamation of Music, Entertainment, Food and Shopping, and was ranked by CNN in 2009 as one of the Top 10 Festivals in the world.\n\nThe musical event also grew to be ranked as the 3rd largest dance festival in the world, after Tomorrowland and Ultra as per the IMS APAC Business Report 2014. This particular musical event is called Electronic dance music (EDM), where a broad range of percussive electronic music genres is played simultaneously in different stages. After starting its journey in the year of 2007,  Sunburn took “Goa” by storm and proved itself as India's pioneering dance music festival by creating a craze of Electronic Dance Music in teenagers while also showing a new modern and evolving trend in colleges throughout the whole India.\n\nAnyway, I like this particular musical event, primarily because it is different from other musical events in a sense that it can produce literally any kind of sounds, from the chirping of birds to a girl screaming, from breaking glasses to screeching discs, and so much more. In fact, I would even dare to suggest that music is unlimited in this genre, as opposed to other “traditional music genre”. Besides, I enjoy this musical event also because the music there creates a certain type of “beat and rhythm” that makes me feel like dancing and happy, unlike any other music."

    "Answer": "I’m going to tell you today about a major musical event in my Country, which is England in the UK. I’ll tell you what it is, where and when it takes place, the sort of music and why I think it is so significant… even though I’m not sure I’d really say I personally enjoy it!\n\nThe event I want to talk about is the BBC Proms. This is an annual summer festival that has been taking place since 1895 so is a well-established fixture in the UK. The festival is of orchestral classical music, the main focus of the festival is the impressive Royal Albert Hall in London, which is a huge domed venue that seats over 5,500 people. As well as the daily concerts there are lots of satellite events in schools and parks, over the eight week period there are probably more than 100 concerts. Some dedicated ‘Prommers’ will get season tickets and attend as many of these as they can.\n\nI’m not entirely sure why this concert season is known as ‘The ‘Proms’. I know Prom is short for Promenade concert, and I suppose originally these were outside events where people could stroll around (promenade) whilst the music was playing.  Now, within the hall itself, I don’t think to stroll around is approved of! However, unusually for classical concerts, at the BBC Proms, there are lots of extra tickets made available for standing only. These are comparatively cheap tickets allowing concert-goers to stand in the arena and gallery areas of the hall. Consequently, the concerts are always packed and accessible to far wider audiences than is usual for classical music which is often too expensive for ordinary people to afford to attend.\n\nAlthough The Proms go on for eight weeks, the really famous event is the closing concert or ‘Last Night of the Proms’. This is always televised and sometimes big screens are put up in parks across London so people who couldn’t get tickets to the event can still watch and join in with the atmosphere. Traditionally this closing concert is quite raucous! People will dress up in patriotic costumes and wave union jack flags. This last concert in the series is usually quite light in tone, with popular classics in the first half, followed by rousing British Patriotic pieces in the second half which many audience members will join in singing with gusto! The sequence traditionally includes pieces by English composers such as Elgar’s ‘Pomp and Circumstance’ and Arne’s ‘Rule Britannia’ and usually concludes with a rendition of ‘Jerusalem’ and the British National Anthem. Informally, post-concert, audiences often spontaneously break out and sing ‘Auld Lang Syne’ but it isn’t a formal part of the program, rather a newly emerged tradition.\n\nFor many, the Last Night of the Proms is quintessentially English. A display of patriotism and a celebration of English Music and traditions. Tickets are extremely hard to come by and although the preceding eight weeks of concerts are really aimed at classical music aficionados, the last night is certainly widely watched and enjoyed.\n\nFor my own part, I have to admit a little sheepishly it isn’t really my thing. I sometimes feel uncomfortable with all the displays of patriotic fervour and think some of the sentiments expressed are rather old-fashioned and inappropriate. Even so, it is an impressive tradition, and if you were a visitor from overseas who happened to be in London in the second week in September I’d definitely encourage you to get along and experience it if you could. You will see English pomp and ceremony, hear British composers and be amazed at how even the stereotypically reserved British, can indeed sometimes be persuaded to come out to play!"

    "Answer": "There are several occasions and places in our country when musical events take place in my country. I'd like to talk about a particular music event that takes place in my hometown and this takes place at the beginning of the spring.\n\nThe event runs through 3-4 days and in 2-3 phases. In the first phase, the local music bands and individuals perform and complete in the event. At the end of the competition, three bands/ individuals are selected and are awarded. This is an important event as it makes the participants famous in the country. This event is broadcasted on a local TV channel and on Radio. This event takes place in the city hall auditorium. Thousands of music lovers and people attend the event to enjoy the music and the competition. Several kinds of music are played and among them, classic, rock, folk and contemporary songs are most famous. \n\nIn the second phase, some famous singers and musicians perform their own songs and people enjoy this very much. Lots of people from different parts of the country come to attend the show and enjoy the music.  \n \nI have attended the event several times and enjoyed every time to be there. The event attracts lots of people and a festivity goes on surrounding this event. I enjoy the music, the gathering and the festivity of this event."

    "Answer": "I wish that I had a lot of money so that I would be able to buy a lot of “special” things, but unfortunately, I don’t really see that happening soon. But, I guess that I could still talk about at least one “special” thing, which I would really want to buy in the future.\n\nI am talking about buying a computer desk. In fact, I have been planning to buy a perfect computer desk for quite sometimes, but I am not buying “perfect” looking computer desk just yet because my family is about to remodel my room, along with the rest of the house, and I want to make sure that my computer desk matches the interior design and painting of my room.\n\nSo, as soon as my room gets a new model and painting after a couple of months, I will go ahead and buy my computer desk, which I want to use, mainly, to keep my desktop computer. My computer desk should be about five feet wide, two and a half feet deep, and the knee space under the desk should about 2 feet high.  Having a perfect L-shape design, the computer desk should preferably be made of solid wood and should also have a nice “Carolina oak” finish. Of course, I wouldn’t mind any other “finish”, but it has to be very “unique” and appealing. Finally, it should also feature a sliding drawer for keyboard storage and two drawers for additional storage on each surface of the “specially designed” computer desk.\n\nAnyway, I want to buy this particular piece of furniture, primarily because my old computer desk is getting “old and obsolete”. Besides, my old computer desk is not spacious enough for my rather large desktop computer. On top of that, I am planning to buy this beautiful piece of new furniture also because I want to be able to give my “newly-remodelled” room a new look. Finally, and most importantly, I also want to buy this special computer desk because I want to be able to feel comfortable physically in an “ergonomic” way while working on it."

    "Answer": "So, I’ve been asked to talk about ‘something special that I’d like to buy in the future’, it’s quite tricky to know how to respond to this topic. Should I pick something that I’d love to buy, but isn’t realistic (like a rainbow); something that I’d love to buy as a gift for someone else (treat my mum to afternoon tea at a posh hotel) or something practical for me (I could really do with a new pair of winter shoes)? In fact, I’m going to go with the first thing that popped into my head when you told me the theme – I’m going to talk about something that I would really really like to buy, but haven’t quite got around to yet.\n\nI’m going to tell you what it is, what is like, when I intend to buy it and why it is I’d like this particular item so much.\n\nThe special thing I have in mind is a photo book. You can get them on the internet I think. You select a range of digital photos that are special or meaningful to you and then arrange them electronically with captions and dates and so on. Then there are specialist companies that will put them together in a traditionally bound physical book.\n\nThe idea is quite a simple one, but genius. In this age of digital cameras, it’s easy to take lots and lots of photographs, some are good, some are funny, and some are indifferent. Many are bizarre; others are hilarious; and some are just terrible, but all of them are quite literally snapshots of memories. However, because now photographs are everywhere, I think we take them a bit for granted and don’t appreciate them as much as we should. The really great photographs get lost in the multitude of average or terrible ones. There are so many files of photos on my computer, that I can’t even remember what they contain, let alone where the most important ones are stored anymore.  So what I’d love to do, is take the time to pick out a selection that is really important to me, and have them brought together in an album that I can treasure and look back on, and share with others. Honestly, nobody really wants to look at 1000 pictures of your holiday/ family/ pet, but they might like to look at half a dozen of each that had been carefully chosen to tell a particular story, and it’s fun to share such memories.\n\nWhen do I intend to do this? Well, interestingly, I have a ‘to-do’ list on my desk. One of the items that have been on it for some years is ‘sort through my photos’. I never get around to it. Maybe now I’ve been made to reflect on it, I should prioritise this task. Just because it has never felt urgent (that is, something I need to do immediately) this activity never makes it to the top of my list. However, it is important, I need to make time for it. Maybe next week – I should give myself a deadline!\n\nI hope you can see already why I’d like to buy this so much. But if I need to explain more, it is because I think by making a selection of really important pictures, I can pick out special memories. By putting these together in a physical book I think they will endure longer and be valued more than if they are lost in the millions and millions of images that fill the internet. Even today, I have on my shelves books that are over a hundred years old, they have pages that have slightly yellowed with age, but are perfectly useable and readable. On the other hand, I have a pile of floppy discs, I have no idea what is on them anymore, and I no longer have a computer that I could read them on, effectively, those contents are lost forever. Despite how clever we are in this digital age, I have a suspicion that it is our books that will outlast us all, not pixels in cyberspace!  What do you think?"

    "Answer": "I have a personal list (wish list you can say) that has many things that I want to buy in future. One such special thing that I want to buy in the near future is a personal car. I mostly use public transportation to move from one place to another and to visit my hometown which is very inconvenient. Owning a car would be a great advantage for me as I would be able to freely move and visit my hometown more frequently.\n \nThe car I want to buy is the Fusion Hybrid car by Ford. This is a stylish looking car which is also fuel-efficient. My preference would be a white colour car. I intend to buy it after 2-3 years as it would allow me to save the money and apply for the car loan I need to purchase it.\n\nThere are so many advantages of owning a car especially in the city I live in. Maintaining perfect timing is pretty tough if you travel on a public bus. You would need to wait for the bus, stay in the long queue for a long. And the frequency of the public buses and the number of people do not allow one to maintain the timing one needs to keep. If I own my own car I'd be able to avoid the usual bad traffic and take the alternatives roads. Travelling on a public bus is inconvenient and you do not have any privacy in it. With my own car, I'd be able to go to my hometown and visit my parents more frequently than I do now."

    "Answer": "I know exactly what the special thing is that I want to buy in the future. In fact, I’d like to buy it right now, as soon as I’ve finished talking to you today! I’m going to tell you what it is, what it is like, when I’ll buy it and explain why it is I want to get it so urgently and so much!\n\nThe item is a spider catcher.  Have you ever hear of them? They are a bit tricky to describe, but basically, it’s a simple gadget that allows you to pick up a spider without hurting or touching it, so you can release it unharmed elsewhere. There are different designs, but the one I like the look of has a long handle with a trigger mechanism at one end which operates some soft gentle bristles at the other. If you believe the adverts, it works by surrounding the spider with bristles that close around it, forming a harmless trap, which allows you to pick up and release the spider without squashing it. To operate it you simply squeeze the lever to open the bristles, position the open bristles over the spider, then release the lever so they gently close around it. You can then pick up the spider and release it somewhere else – a long way away - by once again squeezing the lever to reopen the trap. Apparently, it doesn’t harm the creature, it also promises ‘no mess, safe and easy to use’.\n\nSo that’s what it is called and how it is supposed to work.  I’d like to buy it soon. Why? Because I have a completely irrational fear of spiders!  It is very specific though, I don’t think I have true arachnophobia, I’m fine with even very large spiders if they are outside, but there is a certain form of house spider we have here in the UK which always makes me jump. They are quite large, they can grow to about 12 – 14 centimetres in size, and the males become active in houses around autumn (October time). At this time of year, they leave their webs in search of a female and will move inside to the drier environment of a house after a summer living outside or in sheds. They prowl about looking for female mates. They move very erratically, and quite high up on their legs, plus they have a tendency to loiter in corners or shoot across the floor, where if the light hits them they cast a ridiculously disproportionate shadow. They can’t hurt you, and they are only looking for love, but my how they frighten me if I just catch sight of one unexpectedly. The reason I want to buy a spider catcher soon is that I have just this morning seen an ENORMOUS spider prowling about my living room. I really don’t like sharing my flat with him, even though he means me no harm. Once you have seen one spider there will be more, the next few weeks will bring many such monster spiders into my home, and I want to be prepared!\n\nCatching these spiders is hard. One method I use is to put a glass or jug over the spider, and then slide a piece of paper underneath so you can trap the spider and let it go outside. The problem with this method though is that sometimes the spiders are too big to fit under a glass. Also, they move so fast, they can be gone before you get a chance to catch them, and finally, I don’t really like getting so close to them in the attempt to get them! The spider catcher seems like the perfect solution. I wouldn’t want to harm the spider, it isn’t its fault I’m scared, but I’d prefer not to have them running around all over the place either! That’s why I really, really want a spider catcher of my own. It sounds like the perfect solution for fearful me, facing a potential parade of spiders stomping about when I’m all alone watching a horror film on telly at night as autumn draws in!"

I’ll say who she is, how long I have known her, a bit about her special qualities and why I admire her so much.\n\nI don’t think of this person as old, but I suppose she is because she will be 90 next year, and that’s certainly a good age.  She is a distant cousin of mine, she now lives in a residential nursing home, which makes me sad, but she has had a full and interesting life and done many amazing, brave and brilliant things.\n\nI think I have known her about twenty-one years, but the story of how we came to be friends is a little strange.  I was about to go travelling to Australia and was staying with my parents in London overnight before catching a plane from Heathrow the following day.  Whilst I was there my parents told me about this distant cousin who had been in a road accident and was in a hospital.  She was/is a very well educated woman with many academic and cultural interests, and they were wondering what to take her to read during her stay.  I offered some of my collection of short storybooks.  I wasn’t sure they would be to her taste, they dealt with political issues and were not by any means what I would have expected an elderly sick relative to be interested in.  The volumes were by Alice Walker, Susan Hill and other such writers.\n\nMy cousin loved them!  She wrote to me whilst I was in Australia to tell me, and also mentioned that she herself had worked in Australia for many years. She had a very illustrious career as a paediatric pathologist, but also did research on things like mammalian hearts which took her all over the world.  She asked me to lookup an old friend of hers whilst I was there, which I did with some reluctance as I wasn’t sure what I’d find.  I met another amazing woman who lived in the middle of a beautiful rainforest and was passionate about conservation.  When I came back to England a year later, I visited my cousin to tell her all about my travels, and that was the beginning of an ongoing friendship. We have always corresponded with one another and I find her wise and a great role model.  We have shared interests and I think our personalities are also rather alike – for better or worse!  Opinionated and stubborn at times, but also caring very much about the world and those around us and constantly curious and restless.  Endlessly wanting to go and explore and experience new things.  We share a wanderlust at least!\n\nMy cousin is intelligent, well-travelled and very independent.  She has insight and great skill in academic writing.  Over the years I’ve shared with her my own writing efforts, looked to her for advice on what to do when facing certain decisions, and gained inspiration from her lifestyle.  She is very good at setting herself goals and getting on with things – it would be fair to say she doesn’t suffer fools gladly, so she is certainly someone who will put you straight on things.  I think of her as a ‘critical friend’ I know she cares about me a lot, as I do her, but that doesn’t mean she’ll indulge me at all if she feels I’m being foolish in any way.  She never married, and I too am on my own, so I think we sort of understand one another, and we both like our own space, which can be confusing for some people at times.\n\nI admire her hugely, her health is frail now, and that makes me sad, but she has achieved so much in her career, life and network of friends.  If I can do half as well in the time I have I’ll be very content with that!"

    "Answer": "I don’t think that too many persons, especially the young generation, these days are really that familiar with the idea of admiring old persons. But, there are many things to admire about old persons because of the unique characteristics they carry with them. Today, I would like to talk about one such old person who I admire so much.\n\nThis person is nobody else other than my own old grandfather. Interestingly enough, though, he doesn’t really like it that much when we refer him as an “old” person. Rather, he still likes to introduce himself as a 75 years “young” person! Having known my old grandfather since last 30 years, after learning to recognize and identify a person from the age of 3 or 4 years old, I think that I am in a perfect position to describe my grandfather as a loving and caring person for the most part. Of course, he can also get cranky from time to time if he doesn’t get enough sleep. He also seems to be a more active person than other old people of his age as he still likes to get involved in taking care of some house choirs, like doing grocery shopping and taking out trashes, from time to time. He loves to eat an apple every day, and he also likes to eat fried chicken with his 3 years old grandchild.\n\nMy grandfather is a retired government serviceman, so he still has an ‘aura’ of authority around him, but he doesn’t mind cracking occasional jokes to his grandchildren. Finally, I also think that he is a fairly learned and knowledgeable person, as I have seen him reading many books, but I have seldom seen him arguing with other people.\n\nAnyway, I admire my grandfather, mainly because I have found him to be carrying himself really well even at his old age. I also admire him because of the fact that he still has a “young” heart, which motivates him"

    "Answer": "The aged person whom I really admire and like is my grandmother. From my childhood, she has always been a caring person and loved me very much. Till now she is a good friend of mine with whom I share so many of my personal information. She is a benevolent and good person who possesses a good heart. She tries to help others with her highest efforts. I know her from my childhood as she has been living with us for a long and we have lots of happy memories together. \n\nShe is a successful mother of 4, including my father. She has devoted her entire life for the betterment of her kids and made them educated and helped them greatly to be established. She possesses a nice and charming personality that always pleases people around her. She is a kind and wise woman.\n\nI love and admire her for many different reasons. The most important reason is that of her unconditional love and affection for me. She is a good mentor who can show me positive ways and guide me in my distressing time. Talking to her is a soothing experience and the stories she tells are always attractive and full of morality. I have learned many positive attitudes and good thinking from her. For all those reasons and strong bonding between us, I admire her very much."

    "Answer": "Unfortunately, I am a terrible cook, but I can always appreciate those who can! I’m going to tell you about a friend of mine who is a wonderful chef, how I know her, what she can cook and why I think she is so great it.\n\nThis person is a friend of mine, I know her through a running club I belong too, and as I’ve got to know her better over the years we now socialise together, I also sometimes help her with her allotment and I’ve been lucky enough to eat at her house many times.  She runs her own business, making bespoke biscuits, carefully decorated with original designs, so it’s just as well she can cook. But she also runs a busy household and regularly cooks delicious wholesome meals for her family.\n\nThis friend can seemingly cook anything, anywhere! She makes her own bread and can conjure a meal at a moment’s notice using eggs from her hens and herbs from her garden. She cooks and prepares healthy food and, fortunately for me, seems to enjoy catering for unexpected guests too. She makes very fine chocolate and orange cake, and her biscuits are famous amongst her friends as well as her clients. However, for me, a favourite meal was one she made for me recently. We went up to work on her allotment – that’s an area of land you can rent for a small fee from the local council as long as you use it for growing fruit and vegetables. It was a lovely summer’s day, and we planned to work into the evening preparing the ground. She had planned ahead. She brought up a small gas burner, a saucepan and some chopped red peppers, onions and other vegetables which she cooked up for us with some delicious fried halloumi cheese. She had even thought to bring fresh salad leaves, a light dressing and a sort of wrap to hold it all together. After our hard work on the land, we enjoyed the late evening sun and ate with relish. Nothing tastes as good as \"food eaten outside\" after physical work.\n\nWhy is she so good at cooking? I think it’s partly because she enjoys it, she has had a lot of practice, and it is her passion as well as her profession. I think she is good because she uses fresh and quality ingredients, quite simple recipes often, but tasty nutritious and beautifully – though not over-fussily – presented. I also think a really great cook is calm, relaxed and enjoys the sharing of their labours, she is all these things too. I feel very lucky to know her, and feel a little guilty that I don’t ever cook in return! It seems it is my contribution to always be a particularly appreciative consumer… it is a hard job, but someone has to do it!"

    "Answer": "Not sure about the others, but I always try to take my time to learn about or talk to a cook after enjoying some great dishes, prepared by someone I know. Today, I would like to talk about a person who, I think, is one of the best cooks I have ever known.\n\nHis name is Pradeep Singh, and he works at one of the most popular and busiest restaurants in my hometown. I had visited his restaurant a number of times before, but I met him in person only about a few months ago when I was attending a formal dinner party at his restaurant in order to celebrate the birthday of one of my friends.\n\nOn that dinner party, I saw Mr Pradeep, a strong-built guy in his mid 40’s, approaching me with a smiling face with his “chef apron” on him.  He introduced himself to us by telling that it was his customary “chef-style” to come to his customers if they were having any formal dinner party at his restaurant. I also thanked him for serving me some of the best mutton biriyani, butter chicken (prepared in buttery gravy style, mixed with a mildly spiced tomato sauce) and malai kofta (an Indian vegetarian dish made of potato and cheese balls, dunked in smooth, rich and creamy gravy) I had ever eaten. However, even though Pradeep is excellent at cooking traditional Indian foods, he is also equally able to cook many oriental dishes from China and Japan as well as European, Mexican and Italian dishes to perfection. In fact, I can say this because I have already tried some of these delicious dishes, prepared by Pradeep, in the past.\n\nAnyway, I think that Pradeep is good at cooking because he is never afraid of experimenting with different combination by using different kinds of food ingredients. His approach of serving different kinds of food and menus on different days in order to surprise his customers certainly makes him a good cook. Finally, I think, he is a good cook also because he really loves his profession."

    "Answer": "Thank you for this great topic. To answer it, I’m going to talk about my friend Jesmin who is the best cook I personally know. She has prepared many great meals for me and I can't remember a single occasion when I disliked her meal. I know that every time I go around to her place to eat that I’ll be given something wonderful and tasty!\n\nJesmin isn’t a professional chef or anything like that but I do think that she could easily make a living as a cook and could earn some reputation from it. In fact, she’s a teacher at an elementary school and has a full-time job that means she can only ever cook in her spare time.\n\nI first got to know her when we were at the same school. We were both students in the same class and didn’t know anyone else and we became close because we lived in the same neighbourhood. Even back then she was a terrific cook and she would invite me over to her room on a regular basis.\n\nDuring the college days, neither of us had much money but while I survived on a diet of marmite sandwiches, she would make soups and stews – the sort of really practical food that lasts for a while and can be re-heated and costs very little to make because the ingredients are so cheap.\n\nWhat kind of food does she cook? Well, she’s got a little more adventurous since our student days and she now has a huge variety of dishes. She’s quite experimental and so you can never quite tell what kind of food will be served up when you go around her. It could be traditional French cuisine, a pizza, a mixed-salad,  Spanish paella or even a curry.\n\nI think what makes her so good at cooking is that she loves food herself and she loves entertaining people. She makes food that she thinks people will enjoy. Her passion for cooking and love for a delicious meal makes her stand out of the crowd as an exceptional cook."

    "Answer": "I know some of my relatives who are very good at cooking and I have heard about some famous cooks, nationally and internationally, who have magical powers of making delicious cuisines. But I'd like to talk about my mother whom I think is the greatest cook in the world. I have never enjoyed any menu more than the foods made by my mother. She is a gifted cook and she has a good reputation for making delicious and tasty menus out of very ordinary ingredients.  \n\nThe way she arranges the kitchen and makes foods is lovely and in my childhood, I used to think that she had taken training on cooking. But she actually learned the cooking from her family and was in charge of cooking for a large joint family. She is a graduate and I heard that she has a passion for cooking as she took several subjects related to housekeeping and cooking.\n\nMy mother was raised in a suburban area and got married at her 20 years of old. She continued her education and then took charge of cooking in my father's family. I have heard the appreciation of her cooking from many of our relatives and neighbours and felt proud of her.\n\nFinding her cooking gives me a feeling that it's not a hard task, rather it's an artistic performance that the performer enjoys a lot. Sometimes I have been amazed to find her making foods in no times for the guests.\n\nShe mostly makes foods for the family members and that includes cooking making bread, rice, meats, fishes, burgers, sweet-meats, curry etc. For the festivals, she makes cakes, rich foods, and snacks, local and foreign cuisines. I have found her cooking Chinese, Thai, Italian and Mexican foods as well and that was always a wonder how she has learned those menus as she has never travelled to those countries nor has taken any training on making those foods. It will always be a mystery to me."

    "Answer": "Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to talk about such an interesting topic. In fact, I have had several happy events in my life which I remember today.  But, I would like to talk about just one of those happy events which I consider to be very special also.\n\nIt happened about 8/9 years ago or so, when I just had graduated from my university, and I was very much eager to get a full-time job or some kind of internship. But, the problem was, it was not easy for me to get any job or internship because I didn’t have any kind of formal experience. On top of that, I also didn’t have any access to a computer or the internet at my residence. In other words, applying to jobs wasn’t exactly as easy in those days as it is today.\n\nSo, I was basically relying on checking for job postings on different local and national daily newspapers and then applying for them by using either postal mail or fax. Needless to say, applying to jobs, one after another, in such old and traditional methods required a substantial amount of money which was not exactly easy for a student like me with no particular source of income. So, at one point, I even decided to do some private tutoring in order to pay for the cost of my job application. In this way, my job applying mission had continued for about 5/6 months before I started to get an invitation for job interviews. I even needed to travel a few cities outside of my hometown to attend the interviews.\n\nBut, I was getting a bit frustrated as I was not receiving any positive news from any end, even after trying for long 6/7 months. But, finally, on a fine Thursday morning, I received the good news in an official letter. In fact, I would consider that day to be one of the most memorable and happy days of my life as that’s the day when I received the news of my first job offer."

I was then only 7-8 years old and when I saw a little angel was crying on my mother's lap, I became the happiest man in the world. I was the only son of my parents and when I heard that I will have another sibling, I got very excited and I was counting days when this brother/ sister of mine will come. I speculated and imagined lots of things I would do with my sibling. The day that my sister came into the world was one of the happiest days of my life.\n\nFor the first time, I felt a strong urge to kiss this little fairy child. She was so beautiful and adorable that I thanked God for the gift. My mother asked me to hold her and kiss her but I was afraid to touch her as I thought that might hurt her. I felt like I was flying on that day. My mother gave birth to the baby in a hospital and I was so happy and attached to the event that I denied returning home at night. I stayed in the hospital cabin for about 4-5 days until my mother and sister came home. I came back home with the most precious gift in the world."

So, choosing a favourite photograph of mine, with me in it, is indeed a challenge for me. But, I will still go ahead and talk about a picture which, I think, is one of my favourites for some reasons. I will explain in a minute why.\n\nThe photograph was taken about 4/5 years ago at a formal dinner party after my university graduation ceremony. On that night, all of my university friends were busy taking one picture after another and enjoying the night, so I also decided to do the same and started to take my pictures by forgetting about my “not-so” photographic face for a while.\n\nI am not sure exactly how many pictures of mine were taken on that night, but I would assume, it must have been quite a few, as our graduation party had continued for a while, keeping ourselves busy with singing, playing music and enjoying different snacks, one after another. Anyway, once we were done with the party, our picture films were taken to a local photo studio the next day to process them and get their final version. Anyway, when I finally got to see my own pictures, most of them were looking “less than average” except just one. The picture indeed reflected my celebratory mood of that night, with a very happy and glowing face of me.\n\nStanding next to me in that picture were a few friends of mine who were splattering water. The picture was taken in front of a very nice background that had some nicely trimmed trees and perfect lighting.\n\nAnyway, this is one of my favourite pictures because it brings back some of the most special and beautiful memories – memories like spending my last night as a student with the rest of my friends and recording my first song ever – which I will cherish for the rest of my life. This is one of my most favourite pictures also because, in this very picture, I look to be in my “natural” self."

It’s just beautiful…\n\nIn this photograph, I am carrying my niece and she is smiling up at me. I first saw the photograph about a week ago.

Once I had her in my arms she got happy and smiled. At that perfect moment, the photograph was taken. The picture shows a time when I was happy.

While some of those changes may go unnoticed, others can bring some positive changes in our life, and today I would like to talk about one such positive change.\n\nI had developed many hobbies in my life, but “reading” was just not one of them. Of course, I had no problems whatsoever in studying all kinds of academic books in order to pass the tests at schools and colleges, but when it came to studying anything else, like storybooks, novels, or books on science, technologies, improving life skills and knowledge, I would become one of laziest persons on the earth.\n\nMy parents even sometimes used to “bribe” to develop my reading habit, but nothing was really able to change my mind. But, suddenly, one day, when I was a final year university student about 6 years ago, one of my favourite teachers asked me to suggest some interesting books to read, while he would be gone for summer holidays, I had no clue what to tell. Understanding my awkward situation, my teacher smiled away while I felt really ‘embarrassed’. After that incident, I decided to buy some books and started reading them one page at a time.\n\nSlowly after that, I actually became “addicted” to reading some specific kinds of books. At one point, I even started to struggle to pay for the books I was buying, because they were just so many!\n\nAnyway, I am so glad that I started reading books as it gave a certain kind of confidence boost by teaching me a lot of unknown and amazing thing about this world. Besides, after developing my reading habit, I gained a great level of understanding and appreciation for different kinds of people from different cultures, lifestyles and backgrounds. Finally, this particular change even helped me in developing my career later on in my life by encouraging me to read many books on “career and skill” development."

    "Answer": "You have asked me to think back on some change I’ve made in my life, that turned out to be one for the better! I am going to tell you what the change was and when it happened. I’ll give you a bit of detail about how things were different for me after the change and finish by describing what it means for me now, a bit later in life. The funny thing about changes is that you don’t always recognise them at the time. For me, I didn’t know when I started out that the positive change I was making would turn out to be a long term difference in my behaviour. However, it turned out to be just that. It is only looking back now that I can identify there was a definite shift in what I got up to, and I can even pinpoint a definite time, but in the midst of it all, I had no idea where that change would take me.\n\nThe change was basically that I decided I needed to get a bit fitter, and the thing that helped me do so was joining up to do Parkrun. However, I’m jumping ahead. Let me explain how it came about… A couple of years ago I started to feel like I was getting old and losing my basic fitness. Although I walked quite a lot (as a form of transport, as well as to enjoy the local countryside) I wasn’t really doing anything else very much that was physical. I was never very good at sports, so I didn’t really know where to begin. However, I’ve always liked being outdoors, so on something of a whim I booked an activity holiday in Northumberland, which is a beautiful rural area in the northeast of England, right by the coast. The holiday was great. We did abseiling; hill walking; body-surfing – all sorts of things. In addition, every morning began with a run along the sands of the seaside. Now I’d never run before – well only if I was trying to catch a bus, but otherwise, not at all. I wasn’t very good at it, and honestly, I didn’t even really enjoy it all that much. However, I did have to concede that it is a great form of exercise. You don’t really need any special equipment (apart from decent trainers); you can do it anywhere and it’s free! What’s more, I found out from some other holidaymakers that in the UK there is a free weekly event held nationwide in parks all over the country. It is called Parkrun, and basically people gather every Saturday morning at 9.00 a.m. to run a fixed course of 5km and get time for doing so. I wasn’t too sure if this would be achievable for me. I’d never run that far before. But I promised myself I would try it ‘just once’ to see if I could.\n\nThe day after I got back from my holiday I turned up to do the Parkrun at my local park. I can tell you the exact day! It was 24th August 2013 – I know this because the whole point of Parkrun is that if you register (which is free) then the organisation records your time each week and you can access it online afterwards. The first time I went I didn’t even manage to run the whole way round, but I did finish, and I did get a great sense of achievement. Because you know your time, it is quite addictive, you find you do want to go again the next week and see if you can improve!  My local \"parkrun\" is huge, with well over 500 runners taking part every week – so even though I was pretty slow, I found I wasn’t the slowest.\n\nSince that day over two years ago, I’ve found that I’ve gone to Parkrun almost every week.  I have taken part in some 70 \"parkruns\" and through doing so made new friends, maintained a certain level of fitness, and even gained the confidence to take part in some longer runs.  I’ve done lots of 10km races now, a few off-road runs – including one over 24km as well as taking part in obstacle races!  I would never have believed that the small change of ‘just going once’ to Parkrun to ‘give it a go’ would lead to me being such an enthusiastic member of Parkrun two years later.  By the way, I haven’t really ever got any faster, but I’m definitely a lot fitter.  Now I can’t imagine a Saturday morning without heading off for a run with my 500 friends at the local park!  That first day I turned up nervously to join in with Parkrun was definitely the beginning of a positive change in my life!"

    "Answer": "The positive change that I would like to talk about is ‘I started playing outdoor games instead of playing computer games’. After I got my first personal computer when I was only 9 years old or so, I started learning many things. Besides that, I started playing computer games. As computer games are addictive I found that I was playing the games whenever I had spare times. This addiction barred me from playing outdoor games like cricket, football etc.\n\nI found myself very much attracted to computer games and I preferred to play the games at home instead of going to open spaces or fields to participate in outdoor games that involve physical exercises. Not that computer games are all so bad, but playing them all the time someone has got is not a good thing especially for kids. I found that I was spending more times at home than being outside. After my parents noticed that, they discussed with me about that and explained to me the importance of outdoor activities. They gave me strict restriction that I would only be able to play computer games for an hour daily and in the evening I’d have to go outside to play with my friends.\n\nThis was obviously a very positive change for me. I’m not against computer games but I feel that if there are more important things to do, then we should not spend time on computer games only.\n\nThis change affected me very positively. I became a good cricket player, later on, I started maintaining my times more prudently and I am sure this change has affected me positively in terms of physical and mental health."

    "Answer": "Changes are inevitable parts of human life. Transformation, changes, hopes and challenges make our life exciting and worth living. Some changes are unexpected while some are long-expected and meant to bring something good for us. Often changes define who we are and put us in situations we either find very challenging or favourable. This cue card topic reminds me of an important part of my life when a change brought something positive in my life.\n\nThe change was related to the migration from our hometown to the capital city in our country when I was 14 years old. This was quite a big change for my family, and particularly for me. I had to leave my school, friends, relatives, known places and start living in a place where I had no friends, no one to visit and no known place for playing or outing. Initially, this was quite a frustrating experience for me. After my father got me admitted in a school there, my life became even tougher. However, this did not last for a long.\n\nMy new school was quite remarkable and it is still one of the best high schools in our country. I made new friends very quickly and my teachers were very helpful. I made a few friends in school and playmates in my neighbourhood and my parents used to take me outside every weekend.\n\nMy transitional period was over and I started feeling totally in peace again. Nevertheless, my result in my new school was not promising at all and my parents were worried about it. Being in a small town, it was not that much hard for me to become the top-scorer in the class. But this was not the case in my new school. While I was the top-scorer in my previous school, I could not secure even the top-ten position in my new school. After the first term exam result,  I started studying harder, visit the library more and read a reference book more than ever. I even shrink my time for playing computer games and took part in outdoor games like football. Ultimately, all those changes and activity helped me study more, learn more and remain healthy. I found that some of the health-related problems that I used to have are no longer bothering me. This inspired me to study even harder and spend as much time as possible to recover my old top-scorer image to my parents.\n\nMy parents took me to places where I have observed so many news things for the first time in my life and those experiences enhanced my way of thinking and I could feel a silent transformation inside me. The school library had a huge collection of books and I read many of the books from my 'to-read' list. I was the third-best scorer in the final exam and over the time I started doing even better.\n\nWhy was this change important and how has it affected my later life? Well- I guess I had been able to give you an impression that when I moved to this city, I had to find a way to adapt myself to the changing circumstances and take challenges. The outcome was quite positive and it had taught me to take challenges in my life. These days, whenever I face any new challenge, I remind myself those days and prepare myself for the inevitable. On top of that, this change made me stronger. It was truly a heart-rending even to leave my school, friends and playmates. But finally, I coped with it and learned that we have to go on and grab the opportunities, face the challenges and bring out the best of ourselves to keep pace with the rhythm of the life. Apart from that, being in a new school where I had to face more competition, I studied harder and learned even more. My fresh and inquisitive mind learned so many new things in a large city which would have been quite impossible without moving to this city.\n\nAt this stage of my life, I still think about this change and find it fascinating and inspiring, especially, the way I had been able to handle it. It was indeed a very significant change that brought positive outcomes in my life."

    "Answer": "I have started focusing on me and have started exploring a new me and that is a very positive change for me. For the last 20 years of my life, I was a typical girl who never thought of herself and did her duties and responsibilities for others. \n\nTime was going on and my life was also going on with time in a very banal way. There was no value of time, life and thought. Only there was a tough routine that I had to follow and dedicate myself for others. I do not have any complaints dedicating me for the benefit of others, but that was so typical that I forgot my own existence and my own dreams.\n\nMy dreams were surrounded by someone special. It’s all about someone whom I loved more than my life. But the moment I realised that with whom I nurture all of my dreams, is lost in a very different world where I do not have a special place, I was broken and shaken up. That realisation initially gave me a feeling of being a loser and a helpless one.  It forcefully pulled me at the end of the world and I totally lost my confidence, belief in believing and did not seek any reason to live.\n\nIn that regrettable moments, I never stopped thinking and I asked questions to myself even when I was asleep. I was started regaining my confidence after I started realising the fact and reality. I was determined to hit the sky and not to feel like a looser.  I will never forget the great contributions my friends had overcoming this fatal time and they advised me why I have to love myself and explore my own dreams even after someone has shattered my dreams. They helped me to get out of my dilemma. They reminded me who am I, who could I be!\n\nThe perception of life, reality and dreams seem like have changed in me and I am happy about the changes. It has helped me find the reality, a new me. Now I love myself even more with my every possibility and dream. Now I am taking a journey to look forward and reach a definite goal I have. I don’t know where it would go but I learnt to walk alone, confidently and I love my own reflection."

    "Answer": "My country, India, has been lucky to have become the home to many renowned personalities, from word-class sportsmen to world-famous scientists, who have made “India” great. Today, I would like to talk about one such famous person who is also known as the “missile man” of India.\n\nYes, he is none other than Mr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. Being born in a Muslim family in Tamil Nadu, India, in 1931, the great man studied physics and aerospace engineering in order to become arguably the most prominent Indian nuclear scientist ever.\n\nHolding many important roles and positions in the Indian government, this eminent scientist, and also a politician at the same time, gave India one of its most major and important breakthroughs in its \"defense technology\" by developing the ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes.  Later on, this world-renowned scientist also became a president of India.  \n\nI want to mention this famous person specifically, primarily because he was a very simple and easy-going person, even though he had such extraordinary achievements on his name. Mr Kalam has been an inspiration to millions in the world, who had a great many virtues, dedication, self-mastery, and exceptional scientific aptitude. Born in a rather humble family, this gem of a great leader worked his way to great success. In fact, he was an “epitome” of hard works and success.  \n\nAnd as for the positive changes, he dedicated his whole life to his motherland.  Mr Kalam didn’t only pioneer the Indian nuclear and missile defense programmes but also encouraged Indian automobile makers to enhance vehicle technologies in order to “triple” their productivity and efficiency. This great guy also was concerned for young people of his country as he encouraged them to learn in a good way. His message for the youth of India filled them with new confidence. In fact, many of his inspirational books and speeches reverberate through Indian cities and villages, which constantly motivate both the youth and adults, by saying “I can do it. We can do it. India can do it”. This great person, who is still an inspiration for millions, died in 2015."

    "Answer": "Ooh, I thought at first the cue card meant someone I know personally or had actually met! That would be really hard, I’m not very well connected. Erm, there are so many famous people in my country – England, part of the United Kingdom. I could pick the Queen, I think she is one of the most recognised people the world over, but I think that’s too easy and predictable. I’m going to pick, instead, a famous person from English history, you may never even have heard of her, but she is really important in terms of contributing to political change in my country, and although perhaps not everyone knows her name, most people would know about what she did.\n\nI’ll tell you who the person is, why she is famous and what makes me choose her. Finally, I’ll try and explain how she has contributed to positive change in the UK.\n\nThis person is Emily Wilding Davison, she was born in the 1870s and died, famously, in June 1913. She is famous, or even infamous because she was a militant activist who fought for women's suffrage – that is for women to have the same rights to vote as men - in Britain. She was one of a number of women who protested in different ways about the inequality that existed. At that time, only men were allowed to vote in elections, something that seems incredible today. Some of the protestors took direct action, leading to them being arrested and imprisoned for their views. Once imprisoned, some took it further and went on hunger strike, leading to them being force-fed – Emily herself was jailed on numerous occasion – nine I think, and force-fed nearly fifty times. The reason though, that she is particularly remembered amongst the many women who campaigned so vociferously, is that it was her who apparently died for the cause. On 4th June 1913, she stepped out in front of the King’s own horse when it was racing as part of the famous race the Epsom Derby (this horse race still takes place each year today). She suffered fatal injuries and died a few days later. There was a huge public funeral, and thousands of suffragettes accompanied the coffin and tens of thousands of people lined the streets of London.\n\nPeople have different opinions about whether she actually intended to kill herself, or just to disrupt the race to bring attention to her cause. Personally, I think she would have wanted to live on to continue her protests and contribute to the debate, but her life was cut short aged only 40 years old, by accident. I have chosen her because I think she was a brave and principled woman. I might not approve of all her actions, but without her efforts, and people like her, women would not have ultimately gained the vote in this country, which I consider to be a basic right. Women fought hard for that equality, so I think it’s very important that all people (men and women) exercise their democratic right to vote. It was a right that was hard-won but potentially easily lost. Democracy is an imperfect system, but it the political one we have in the UK, and I believe women and men should have equal influence in how it is executed. It takes courage sometimes, to stand up for what you believe in, and her courage cannot be disputed.\n\nIt is hard to say that anyone action or person brought about the enfranchisement of women, but certainly, her actions on that day brought the debate about women’s equality to centre stage. It led to more men supporting the campaign, widening the voices of arguing for equal rights and overtime. Some women got the vote in 1918, after the first world war, but only those who were householders over the age of 30 (6 million women); women over 21 did not get the vote until 1928, so perhaps it’s only then you can say there was equality.  She, therefore, contributed to the positive change of bringing about equal rights in voting for men and women in the UK.\n\nOver time in this country, people have come to take the right to vote for granted, I think the contribution of the suffragettes in general and Emily Wilding Davison, in particular, might come to be forgotten over time. I was pleased therefore to hear that a new film is coming out on exactly this period of history, it’s (unsurprisingly) called ‘Suffragette’! I haven’t seen it yet – I wonder how close it will be to the truth of those times – perhaps we’ll never know!"

    "Answer": "I haven’t really visited many libraries in my life, perhaps, because I didn’t have very many libraries, closed to where I lived. However, when I was studying at a university, I needed to visit its library once in a while for study purpose. So, today, I will just go ahead and describe that particular library as best as I can.\n\nAs I just mentioned earlier, it was a university library, which stood tall in the heart our rather large university campus, with many other administrative and faculty buildings around it. It was a four-storey building with enough space for reading for nearly all of its students. One of the great features of this library was that it could be accessed from all directions. Even though the library was old, it had a nice architecture as it would receive enough natural light and air as long as they were available.\n\nEach floor of the library had two parts, with one part providing the space and facilities for regular library activities, while the other part in the front remained empty like a long and spacious balcony. Anyway, the top three floors of the library contained all the books and research materials, many of which were as old as two hundred years, in order to help students gain knowledge, while the bottom floor contained only newspapers, magazines, journals and other kinds of periodicals. All the floors had a separate and large section for receptions in the middle of them which would provide different kinds of educational videos to students. Finally, each floor of the library had a separate section to sit and relax for the visitors while watching some TV programmes.\n\nAnyway, this library had a great influence on me, primarily because I could learn about a lot of new and interesting things, every time I had visited it. Besides, after visiting this library, I met some really genuine and brilliant minds, who could provide me with important insights on different issues.  Finally, I felt that the library could actually also provide me with a great escape from the stress of my daily life sometimes."

    "Answer": "The library I’d like to talk about that I visited is ‘Illumination Library’ (Tell the name of a library from your home town)  and it is situated in my home town. I have not visited this particular library for the last 2-3 years as I am not living in my hometown any longer and yet this is the library I will always remember. This library is situated at the centre of our hometown and occupies the whole 3 story building. There are plenty of books there and the library offers a variety of books, novels, research papers, magazines and so on for the people of different tastes.\n\nThe books are well catalogued and arranged in a convenient fashion. There are more than 3-4 librarians and several other assistants to help find any book. The library also offers membership facility and the active members are allowed to take books to home. Since the library is funded by the government the membership fee is very negligible and affordable for students, there are lots of people visiting and reading there.  \n\nPeople of our hometown consider this library as the best place to gather knowledge, read in peace and to find reference books for study or professional reasons. For me, this library has a great influence on me. I became a member of this library when I was only 7 years old. My reading habit has been grown up from there. I became a passionate reader of books and novels and this library had a great influence on that. This library also helped me finishing some academic projects as I could find books and reference reading materials. I have read plenty of books in my childhood and adolescence time only because the library was conveniently there for me."

    "Answer": "To tell the truth, as far as I am concerned, “bad weather” could mean only one thing to me, and that is “cold’ weather. But, no matter how I dislike this “cold” weather, I do have to experience it every year, just like I did about a few years ago.\n\nAs I have already mentioned earlier, I don’t really like cold weather, especially, if it is associated with fog.  But, I am pretty sure that Mother Nature doesn’t really care whether I like it or not, just as it didn’t on a December morning about a few years ago when I needed to drop my uncle at the airport.\n\nAs soon as I woke up in that morning and took a peek through the window, I immediately knew that it was going to be a “rough ride” on the roam for us as I could see fog all over. Still, I took my old car and hit the road after wearing all kinds of warm clothes to protect me from the onslaught of a cold winter morning in order to reach the airport as early as possible. But, despite my best efforts and intention, I was not able to reach the airport on time, because the traffic on the road was too slow due to too much fog and low visibility of the road.\n\nIn fact, my uncle and I gave up the idea of catching the flight, but we still took a chance and arrived at the airport anyway. Luckily, the airport authority had understood the gravity of the situation, due to the bad weather on that day, and decided to delay the flight.\n\nAnyway, we were lucky to catch the flight, in the end, thanks to the airport authority, but we had to go through a lot of concern and frustration on the road because of bad weather, caused by extreme fog. Even worse, I even felt very nervous and scared as I almost was going to have an accident because of low visibility on the road. So, it was indeed a bad experience for me."

    "Answer": "Well, I am from England, and in England, we love to talk about the weather! It changes all the time, and so it’s actually quite hard to think of one specific example of bad weather that I have experienced there. Even so, I can recall one particularly extraordinary day, when bad weather brought my city of Sheffield to a standstill. I am going to tell you what the weather was like, where I was when it happened and how it affected me I still shiver as I recall it!\n\nThe bad weather was snow. It does snow in parts of the United Kingdom every year, and where I live in Sheffield we do always get some snow in the winter months, especially on the higher ground. I quite like snow, it can be cold and a bit inconvenient if you get a heavy snowfall, as then public transport stops and everything grinds to a halt. However, it is also really beautiful how a snowfall can turn everything white. It is fun to build snowmen, make snow angel shapes in the newly fallen snow, to go sledging in the hills and even to have a sneaky snowball fight if you are brave enough to find someone to take on. So on the whole, I like snow, I enjoy the novelty of it, and as long as you are dressed appropriately (hat, gloves, scarf, waterproof trousers and thick winter coat) it isn’t too bad. The day I’m thinking of, though was rather different.\n\nI woke up on a December morning about four years ago and the first thing I noticed was that it was really really quiet. It is hard to describe if you have never experienced it, but after a thick snowfall, everything sounds different. The sounds that you normally hear are changed by the muffling effect of the snow, but also there was no sound of traffic. The snow had fallen so deeply, those cars were stuck in driveways and buses in their depots, the only way to get about that day would be on foot. I was lucky because I only lived about two miles from work, so I could still get in. I pulled on my wellington boots, and waterproof clothes and headed off into town. I quickly discovered that this was not like any normal snowfall. The snow had fallen feet deep onto the ice, it was really treacherous even trying to walk in these conditions. Where I live in Sheffield, it is incredibly hilly. Snow ploughs had cleared the major roads, but this had exposed dangerous thick black ice underneath which was impossible to walk across. The combination of ice and steep slopes meant that I was sliding around everywhere and so was everyone else. Although at first, it was quite comical, watching people skidding about and falling over, after a while I started to be quite anxious, it was dangerous, you couldn’t even stand upright. I got to one road crossing at the top of a hill, and the road was so slippery the only way to get over it was to literally crawl across on my hands and knees. The other side of the road a complete stranger was lying down and reaching out to pull people across safely. It was so bizarre, I have never seen anything like it before or since. The roads were thick ice, but the pavements were piled high with drifts of snow up to three feet deep, I thought I’d never make it to the office that day let alone home again by nightfall!\n\nMy normal walk to work would have taken me perhaps 30 minutes, but on this day it took over three times that long as I had to negotiate the tricky roads and paths. When I got there, I found only a couple of other people had made it in as well. Most people had looked out of their windows and decided it was far too dangerous to attempt the journey. I think they were right! My manager had made it in, but he quickly decided it was silly to stay, we all still had to get home safely somehow, and it was still snowing outside. I was working at a university at the time, and for the first time in its history it was declared closed, it was ridiculous to expect staff and students to make the trek in – I should have stayed in bed! We stayed at work long enough to phone people to cancel appointments and confirm we were shut, and then I had the same long trek home in the snow again. I was exhausted by the time I got back!\n\nIt was quite an experience, it made me appreciate how much we should respect the elements. I felt safe at first because it was an urban environment, and usually, we don’t get much disruption due to bad weather there, but really the snow and ice made it unnavigable for the next few days. I suppose in countries where they always get a lot of snow and ice they are better prepared for it when it comes. We were certainly taken by surprise. That was my most memorable bad weather adventure. It was fun in a way, but I wouldn’t welcome that every year, plus it was freezing. It’s hard to keep smiling when you are so cold! I still love the snow – but I respect it a lot more than I used to."

    "Answer": "The experience I would like to talk about took place 4-5 years back and I was a college student at that time. One day I heard that my uncle is sick and my parents asked me to give him a visit. Since my college was closed at that time, I decided to go to my uncle's house. The journey towards my uncle's house took me 7-8 hours and I had to take a bus, then a boat and finally, walk for 2 kilometres to reach the house.\n\nThe place was in a remote urban area and there was no direct bus or train communication there. However, the journey I took to reach there was enjoyable and I had good times at my uncle's house. I was glad to see him getting well and spent some quality time with my cousins. After 2-3 days I said goodbye to my uncle, aunt and cousins and took my journey toward my home. They were convincing me to stay a few days more but I could not as my classes were due to start.\n\nI left my uncle's house at 3:00 pm and the weather was cloudy. The weather was comparatively good even when I got on a big boat to reach the town to pick a bus. But after 30 minutes or so, the sky all of a sudden became intimidating. The lightning and the sound of it gave the impression that heavy rain is approaching. But instead of the rain, a devastating storm hit in and the boatmen failed to control the navigation of the boat. People became so scared that they started praying to God. I was very frightened as well.\n\nAt a point, I started feeling that the boat might sink and I might never reach home alive. The storm showed no signal to calm down and the powerful wind blowing was trying to take away everything from its way. The wind was blowing from every side and we could not see anything nearby or distant.\n\nThe boatman yelled and asked us to hold something strongly and get prepared to swim to the nearby land if needed. I knew how to swim but I found 2-3 persons were crying as they did not know how to swim. Their screaming made the situation even worse and I felt a strong urge to stay alive. I am not sure how long this shattering storm lasted but to me, it seemed like the eternity. Later on, I found that the strong lasted for about 40 minutes and the boat has reached a completely different place. By the time the storm has pacified, we were grateful to be alive. We found 1 woman and a kid have become sick and were vomiting in fear and for the sudden impact of the heavy storm. I reached to a highland and sat in a shop for about 15 minutes to realise what just happened. I have some other bad weather experience but no other one was a life threat as this one was.\n\nAfter I reached home, I did not tell my parents about it. I told them the truth after 1 week. I will never forget the experience I had on this way back journey from my uncle's house."

    "Answer": "It was probably July of 2014 and it was a rainy reason when I had to experience bad weather condition and the experience was so bad that I still remember it clearly. Our local area was a comparatively low area, and the rainy reason often caused us trouble.\n\nIt started with heavy rain and the rain continued without any cease for a week. This causes the roads and fields overflowing by waters. We knew that the rainy season has started. One night we wake up suddenly in the middle of the night and felt that something is wrong. I noticed that the water has reached our house and was approaching to our floor. I was a bit afraid and called my mother. Our entire family members wake up and within an hour the water was all around the room.\n\nThere was nothing to do and we found that people in our locality have waked up and had been busy to move their furniture to safe places. In the meantime, the water level has reached to well over our floor and most of our furniture was staying in the water.\n\nI was not quite grown up then and I felt great anxiety because of the sudden hit of the flood. My parents tried to console me and assured me that we will be safe in a few hours. But my gut feeling told me that things are not going to be okay. I felt helpless and prayed to God so that he takes away the water from our house. This was the first time when I noticed the devastating form of the flood. As it was the first flood experience in my life, I could not imagine what was happening and how would we get away from it. The night was sleepless and the next morning we took the valuable furniture and other belonging to one of our relative’s house who stayed on the 6th floor of a building. We kept the rest of the furniture in our house in the floodwater.\n\nMy parents sent me to my grandfather’s house which was in a different city where flood did not hit and after few days they also came there to get rid of the flood. We stayed at our grandfather’s house for about 15 days and returned home after the floor water decreased and went away."

    "Answer": "Over the last couple of centuries, our world has been lucky enough to see many important innovations, which have brought many positive changes to the life of its inhabitants. However, I would like to talk about one of those innovations here today which probably has done more to influence the entire human race than anything else in the world.\n\nThe name of this particular innovation is “Telephone”. In plain English, it is a device that converts sound and electrical waves into audible relays and is used for communication by using a microphone and speaker.\n\nMany people had tried to play with the idea of coming up with such innovation, but it was Mr Alexander Graham Bell, who finally succeeded in doing it in 1876.  Of course, as with every other thing, when the telephone was first introduced, only the rich people could afford it as the materials, needed to use or connect the device, were quite expensive. But, as people slowly started to understand its full potentials, the telephone became an every household item, as it allowed them to communicate with each other seamlessly, no matter where they lived, whether they were maintaining a long-distance relationship or doing a multi-million dollar business in another country.  In fact, communication would never be the same after the introduction of the telephone.\n\nAnyway, the positive influence of telephone can be seen in the ease of communication and carrying on with our daily activities 24 hours a day and 365 days a year without any interruption. It also led to the development of city centres, office buildings and the concept of an urban worker society. Besides, it has also lead to the creation of many jobs by changing the pace of business. The telephone has also provided security and helped in emergencies.  However, probably the most positive influence has come in the form of a whole host of new inventions, like the smartphone and the internet, with which, we can now not only talk but also see each other live on video at the same time."

    "Answer": "It is really tough to pick one particular scientific invention that had positively influenced the human race as there are possibly hundreds and thousands of such inventions. I would like to pick the 'Light Bulb' as one such invention that has very positively influenced the human race.\n\nThis single invention of science has uplifted the human race towards prosperity and the modern world. Think about the world without any lights in the dark and we would have been no different than living in a cave. The great scientist \"Thomas Edison\" is credited to invent the light bulb and till then many improvements have been done to it.\nThe bulb is the main source of illumination and light at night time when the Sun is hiding at the opposite side of the world. We are so habituated with the electricity and light bulbs that we might wonder if it is a life-changing invention or not.\n\nBut think about living your life for a few days without the bulbs and then you would realise the true importance of this single invention. Some may argue that the fuel-powered lighting system could have been alternative to it, but the reality is that that would have been too expensive and could not have been an easy source for lighting the houses,\nThink about the other living beings other than human; they mostly get back to their living place in the evening and except some nocturnal animals and birds, most of them stay at their living place till the morning.\n\nThey rarely do anything at night and that's because they are afraid of the dark and have no vision to see at night. As the human, we could have some lighting system if we did not know how to illuminate the light bulb but that would not have been so widespread without the invention of the light bulb. Scientific inventions are interrelated and one invention or theory inspired and accelerates the invention of other important inventions.\n\nThe Light bulb is one such invention that has inspired the invention and research of other inventions. This is the single invention that has made us free from being active only at day time when the sun is there."

So, I must thank you for offering me this great opportunity to share this plan for my forthcoming visit.\n\nThe country, I want to visit, is called “Nepal”. Famously known as “the daughter of the mountain” or “the daughter of Himalayas”, this small South Asian country is landlocked between India and China.\n\nBeing home to eight of the world’s tallest mountains, including the Mount Everest, Nepal attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year from around the world. I am planning to visit this beautiful country the next summer, when I will get some time off from my job, because of its stunning natural beauties.

After that, I want to view the beautiful and giant mountain range of the Himalayas by visiting “Dhulikhel”, which is about two hours drive from Kathmandu. Then I plan to visit Pokhara, where Nepal’s startling beauty is at its best, which has been the subject of many travel writers. In fact, its pristine air, the spectacular backdrop of the snowy peaks of the Annapurna Range and the serene Phewa, Begnas and Rupa Lakes, makes this destination ‘the Jewel of the Himalaya’.\n\nI also want to explore the fascinating Kathmandu Valley which is comprised of the three ancient cities, including Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur.  The valley houses seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is also home to a myriad of monuments, sculptures, artistic temples and magnificent artworks. Finally, I am planning to spend about 7 days in Nepal while also trying some of their most delicious local food."

    "Answer": "I have planned to visit Greece after my graduation is done. I have a relative there and he has invited me to visit his family several times. Earlier this year when I was promoted to the final year of my graduation, I have planned to visit at least one foreign country just after my graduation day. I have considered many countries and finally planned to visit Greece. It is a country in southern Europe and has around 11 million populations.\n\nI have planned to visit Greece in the middle of the next year and would stay there for about one month. The relative I have there is my maternal uncle and he lives in Athens with his family. There is a good chance that I will be staying with them during my visit there. Greece is a culturally rich country that offers visitors and tourists a lot of amazing activities, splendid sceneries, museums, diverse culture and so on. The museums, archaeological sites and the tours offer the chance to closely know the history of this country. The islands are the main characteristic of Greece’s morphology and have become a big part of their custom and culture.\n\nThere are 2-3 main reasons I would like to visit the country. First, the invitation to visit my maternal uncle has been pending for several years and I thought it a good chance to meet them. Second, I am a big fan of mythology and Greek mythology was one of my most interesting readings for the last few years. Those stories have been so profoundly entertaining and thought-provoking and suddenly I found a great desire to visit the place in person. Though things have changed there with time, the archaeological sites and museum would walk a visitor through the past and present and would amaze them.\n\nThis is an ideal place to stay and enjoy. This is a country of crossroad colour of culture, history, diversity, the warmth of friendliness, expectation, discover and expedition. For all those reasons I have decided to visit Greece in the next year."

    "Answer": "I don’t really have that many important things, which I possess, except for my wristwatch, smartphone, laptop and camera. While all of those things are important to me in one way or another, I would choose my camera to talk about here today.\n\nIt is a digital camera. One of my elder cousins gave it to me as a gift about 5 years ago, when he visited abroad.  It is a compact, 8 Mega Pixel Camera which is about 6 inches in length and 4 inches in width. Having a beautiful silver colour, this camera has a picture resolution of 3264 x 2448. It also has a Full Frame (36 x 24 mm) sensor. Unlike old-style film cameras, my digital camera can capture and record images of any kinds of objects around us, using digital technology. In other words, they store photographs not as patterns of darkness and light, but as long strings of numbers.\n\nThis camera has a perfect size zoom lens and carries a memory card as well as batteries in it. This is a light-weight camera which also happens to be water-proof and rather strong. Anyway, I love my camera because I can carry it anywhere I go, so I guess that I wouldn’t really be too much interested to hand it over to somebody else unless there is a very valid reason to do so. After all, I take care of my camera as a little brother, and I don’t think that others would do the same.\n\nAnyway, this camera is an important thing for me because I have a habit of taking a lot of pictures of wherever I go.  And, since this camera has many advantages, like it gives me instant photographs, allows me to edit them at will, and makes it easier for me to share photographs using cell phones (mobile phones), emails, and web sites, it has become like an “automatic” partner for me wherever I travel. Besides, its “video recording” option allows me to record any kind of happy and fun event, like wedding, birthday parties or hanging out with friends."

    "Answer": "My cell phone is very important to me as it helps me communicate with my friends, family members, teachers and gets me connected with the people I care. I use the internet on my cell phone, check my emails, update my blog, track the statistics of my website, send and receive SMS, play games, listen to music, take pictures and then share on my Facebook and Twitter profiles. Besides these I do lots of other things in my cell phone including using important apps, reading e-books, using it as a modem to use the internet on my PC etc. My father gave me the money to buy a cell phone and I bought the HTC desire X cell phone from an authorised seller. So my father actually gave the mobile phone to me.\n\nThis smartphone has a versatile usage and is very special to me. I spent significant time with this device and some of them are very positive for me like updating my blog and reading e-books. This is a small device with approximately 6.5 x 4 inches dimension but it is a powerful tool and the internet connection in it makes it even more powerful. The first and foremost speciality of this device is that it lets me get connected with my family members and friends. Second, it is an amusement and recreational device that lets me play games and listen to music. Third, I can update my social networking profiles and get updates from my friend right from my cell phone. I had to go to a cybercafe to check an email or to send one before I purchased this smartphone. Now I have this handy device that I can easily use to connect to the internet. Since this is an android OS device I can download many application and tutorials and learn new things. Sometimes I take photos and then share it with my friends. Communication has become so easy and convenient with the help of this cell phone.\n\nYes, if needed I can give this device to someone who I care about but I will then have to own another one. It's not like I will give this cell phone to someone and then would stop using any cell phone or switch to an ordinary phone. What I mean is, I can give this particular phone to someone but can't stop using a Smartphone. Technological advantages have made things easier especially communication and my cell phone is an important device to me."

    "Answer": "This topic is quite difficult for me to speak about. It depends on which bit of the subject is most important. You see, for me, the ‘shopping centre’ implies a big commercial area like a mall with lots of chain stores and possibly out of town. In fact, there is one outside Sheffield - the city where I live – it’s called ‘Meadowhall’ – but people locally refer to it as ‘Meadow-hell’ because it is vast and soulless. Some people love it because there is a huge selection of branded shops, but personally, I hate going there. I don’t really enjoy going shopping for the sake of it, and for me, the centre lacks character. Therefore, if you want me to speak on the topic of a shopping centre that ‘I often go to’ it would never be a large mall or retail centre as such, it would be quite, quite different.\n\nI’m therefore going to tell you about a different sort of shopping centre that I go to often. I will interpret ‘shopping centre’ as the place at which I do most of my shopping, and hope that that will be good enough for you! I will tell you where it is, how often I go there and why. I’ll try to convey something of its characteristics and explain why I end up nipping over there several times a week.\n\nThe shopping centre is about 2 miles up the road from where I live. I could walk there, but when I go I’m usually heading there to do a big food shop and other errands, so I tend to take the car, or sometimes I’ll walk up and catch a bus back. The shops are in a sort of village at the edge of the city of Sheffield, it’s called Fulwood. I go at least once a week to do my food shop at the local co-op mini-supermarket store, and I also visit the post office at the same time. However, there are other little shops there too – a newsagent; a florist; a greengrocer who sells high-quality fruit and veg and a really good hardware store for household storage and cleaning items. These are all quite handy, so sometimes I’ll just nip over to buy something specific like new batteries for a clock or bin-bags if I’ve let myself run out – I can be there and back in 20 minutes if I take the car. I probably end up going to the shopping area twice a week on average.\n\nWhy do I go? Because it’s near; the shops cater for almost all of my general needs; and because it’s local to me the staff know me. Sometimes they’ll have a chat in the post-office when I go to send a parcel and in the co-op, the woman always gives me a double discount if she can (I have some special loyalty cards but I don’t always remember to have them with me so she gives me the benefit of the doubt). I also think that because most of the people who work in the shops own them (they are all small businesses) you get better service. The proprietors care very much about their customers, and they appreciate you coming back as a regular. It is a much friendlier and more personal experience than I’d get at a big anonymous out of town mall. Also, if I’m honest, because there aren’t that many shops were I go, I probably save quite a bit of money. There is no temptation to impulse buy anything extravagant, or to sit down and have a cup of coffee every few yards either!\n\nSometimes I need things that I can’t get locally, like clothes or perhaps electrical items, and then I do have to grit my teeth and go into town, or head to the out of town mall -  although I also do some of that kind of shopping on the internet these days. Anything to avoid the retail nightmare of Meadowhall – perhaps I’m just too old for that these days!"

    "Answer": "I like to visit different shopping centres, whenever I get an opportunity unless they are too crowded and too expensive for my liking. Today, I would like to talk about one such shopping centre which I really like to visit often.\n\nThe shopping centre, which I like to visit, is located in a commercial location in my hometown. There are a few other shopping centres in my hometown, but this one is different in the sense that it attracts people from all walks of life. Even people from other cities also visit this shopping centre just to take a look at it because of its huge size.\n\nBy the way, this shopping centre is made of a 5 storey building which is about 800,000 square feet. This shopping centre literally has all kinds of shops which sell apparel, footwear, home décor, beauty and cosmetic products, home appliances, electronics etc.  Being home to many famous brand shops from around the whole world, this shopping centre also has a huge food court that sells all kinds of food and cuisines to its customers.\n\nHaving a water fountain on each of its floors, the shopping centre also has a large playground for children of young ages. Having an attractive architectural design, with an oval shape, this shopping centre has plenty of empty space around it to ensure enough parking facilities. Built with reinforced concrete and steel, along with expensive, beautiful glass windows and perfect lighting scheme, this shopping centre could easily be one of the most attractive landmarks of my hometown, especially, during the night time. However, as much as I like this shopping centre, I am not really able to visit it more than once or twice in a month because of my busy life schedule.\n\nAnyway, I visit this shopping centre, mainly because I can do a quick price comparison there, by going to different stores, before buying anything. I like to visit this shop also because they have all kinds of products under one roof. Finally, I come to this shopping centre because I can enjoy some great food at its food court with my friends."

    "Answer": "The shopping centre that I often go to and would like to talk about is (...tell a shopping centre's name from your city....). This is the largest shopping centre of the city and is probably the most popular one. This shopping centre is in the middle of the city and is 20 stories. You can find almost everything in this shopping centre and the reasonable prices and quality of the products have made it a popular shopping mall where people from all classes come to shop. You name it and you can find it here; from grocery shop to 3D cinema, the food-court to the playground, gym and thousands of shopping shops are there. The market authority imposes a strict rule about the quality and price and that's why you can find products at a reasonable price here. The neat and clean environment, the rigid security, the arranged shops and shopping convenience are the main reasons I visit this shopping mall very often. There is a dedicated floor only for social gathering and there you can sit and talk to your friends as long as you like.\n\nI go there almost 2-3 times a month. If there are more shopping to do, or if it is before any major festival, I go there more than 2-3 times. I go there not only for shopping but also sometimes for social gathering, party, to have lunch or dinner or to watch a movie.\n\nThere are many positive reasons why this shopping centre is popular among the visitors and shoppers including security, reasonable price, shopping convenience, the position of the shopping centre, and convenience of parking, open space and neat environments. The interior and exterior of the shopping mall are very attractive. In front of the building, you will find a large open space, more like a big park or a garden. You can sit there for a long and no one is going to ask you to go away!"

    "Answer": "I love holidays, and I always try to make the best use of them, by engaging myself in some of my favourite hobbies or some other favourite activities. But, whether I go to visit any interesting place or just stay in my hometown, largely depends on the duration of my holidays.\n\nFor example, if the holidays are only for a day or two, I mostly try to stay at my home while inviting some of my close friends and relatives over to my place in order to enjoy some movies and good meals. Sometimes, I even hang out with my friends at some of my favourite cafés or even visit a movie theatre in order to enjoy a good movie. Going to do some fishing at a nearby lake, playing some of my favourite sports, or just visiting some countryside are also some of my favourite things to do when my holiday lasts only for a day or two. However, whether I am going out for some outdoor activities or staying at home also depends on the weather and my mood.\n\nOn the other hands, if the holidays last longer than two days, I try to visit some interesting places in my country either with my family members or some friends. Talking about visiting interesting places, I try to go to a place of great natural beauty that has ocean and mountain in it or some old historic sites. Sometimes, I also like to take my friends with me and visit some new places, like new cities or new tourist resorts, which I have never visited before.\n\nAnyway, when enjoying holidays, whatever we do seems to be interesting. However, talking specifically, some of the interesting things, which happen during my holidays, may include meeting new people, visiting some nice places, trying some of the local and special food, and taking interesting pictures of some beautiful birds and other animals. Besides, having a swimming competition in a lake or ocean, when visiting a holiday resort, and making videos of our fish barbeque are also some of the interesting things which I enjoy during my holidays."

    "Answer": "In most of my holidays, I go to visit my family members in my hometown. For my job, I am currently residing in the capital city of my country but my parents, siblings, grandparents, uncle and aunts are living in our hometown. So in most of my holidays, I go to visit my family members. My typical holidays last for 4-5 days most of the time and sometimes I get longer holidays.\n\nWhen I was a university student, I had some friends studying in the same faculty who were from my hometown. During my university study, we used to go to our hometown together on our vacations but nowadays I go to my hometown mostly alone. The journey takes about 6-7 hours by bus. Sometimes we travel by train and this train journeys usually take 8-9 hours including the stoppage. Though the journey is tiresome sometimes, the thought of meeting my family members and the excitement of being in the place I really love, wash away the tiresomeness and monotonous feeling of the journey.\n\nThe time I stay with my family members and local friends, I enjoy the moments very much. This is the town where I grew up and naturally all of my childhood & adolescence memories are related to this place. I do lots of interesting things there during my holidays: I swim in the river, take care of the garden and firm we have, collect vegetables and fruits from our garden and then make arrangement to sell those to the local sellers, sometimes I catch fish, play with my friends both indoor and outdoor games, visit different places and do lots of other stuff.  \n\nIn my city life, I have to follow a strict timeline and stay at my office most of the time, but in my hometown where I mostly go during my holidays, I am quite free and do whatever I feel like doing and spend time with the people I care most. That's why I prefer to go to my hometown during my holidays rather than going to other places."

Since I am a busy person with my work, this is the only time for me to interact with my family members. So I always want to spend these days only with my family members.\n\nLast year, I went for a holiday for two weeks which was very interesting because we cooked food for ourselves on the roadside and we also found some suitable places for having food. It was the first experience of such kind for me and I will never forget it. I am not good at cooking. But on those days I made different foods which were a whole new experience for me as well as for my family members. Actually, we planned to buy foods from some restaurants. However, it did not work due to some reasons. Firstly, I felt very sad because of the inconvenience. But later we managed very well and we enjoyed a lot.

    "Answer": "Today I am going to tell you about my favourite animal, what it is, where it lives, when I first encountered it and why I like it so much.\n\nI like lots of animals, so it is difficult to choose just one. However, I think my favourite animal is the Warthog. Warthogs live in Africa, they are a sort of wild pig. They get their name because they have four fleshy bumps on their faces, which look a bit like warts. These are part of the defence mechanism for males when they fight. Some people think warthogs are ugly, but I think they are lovely, they have great character.\n\nI was lucky enough to spend some time volunteering at a property in South Africa. At the property, there were three young warthogs which had been orphaned after their mother was poached – killed for food. The baby warthogs were, therefore, hand-reared. When they were old enough, they were set free to run around in the wild. However, because they were so used to people they preferred to stay nearby. \n\nThese three warthogs were very friendly, intelligent and loved to play. They also like to follow their leader. In the wild, baby warthogs will run after their mothers, these three young hogs used to follow us. They would run after us even if we were in a vehicle or on a horse – once they even tried to follow the landowner when he took off in his helicopter! The pigs (as we started to call them) loved to be scratched and cuddled, they were very affectionate. They were also very nosy, whatever we did, they wanted to be with us!\n\nI love warthogs, they are energetic, loyal, and funny and I think they are beautiful too. Though I do understand the saying ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder!’"

    "Answer": "People love different kinds of animals for different reasons. Some love them because they look so “cute” and adorable while others love them because of their rather smart and loyal character. Anyway, like many others, I also have my favourite animal, about which, I will describe very shortly.\n\nThe name of my favourite animal is “deer”, and they belong to the Cervidae family of mammals. Other members of the family include Elk, reindeer, chital, roe and etc. Depending on where we live, we can find over 90 species of deer around the world. Deer are lean and long-legged animals. Deer species range from very large to very small. The smallest deer is the Southern pudu which can weigh only about 20 lbs. (9 kilograms) and gets to be only about 14 inches (36 centimetres) tall when fully grown. On the other hands, the largest deer is the moose which can grow up to 6.5 feet (2 meters) from hoof to shoulder and weigh around 1,800 lbs. (820 kg). Their typical colouring ranges from reddish-brown to grey-brown with the cream-coloured underside.\n\nDeer live in lots of different places in the world including Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. They don’t live in other continents because of their extreme weather. They usually live in or close to forests in small groups, called herds, with other deer. Some Deer sometimes even make their own beds out of plants! Anyway, I like deer for a number of reasons, but the main reason, of course, is their sheer speed.   \n\nAnyway, deer are my favourite animal because they look so distinctly beautiful with some of their unique features. They are also my favourite animal because they are never violent around us human, or for that matter, with any other animals! In fact, they are very social, with one group of them watching over another, but shy and very wary creatures, features which make them look very “adorable”. Finally, deer are my favourite animal also because they are strictly “vegetarian”, eating grass and plants that are mostly redundant, and thus helping maintain some kind of ecological balance around us."

    "Answer": "I think this is an easy topic for me and I would like to thank you for this nice topic. My favourite animal is the cow and it is much more beneficial than other animals. Cattle would be the accurate term to use but this animal is colloquially known as cows. Since I have always called it cow, I would like to refer it so.\n\nIt gives us milk which is a nutritious protein supply for us. It provides us with meat and the leather equipment are made from its skin. In some countries, the cow is used for ploughing the land and for farming purposes. The teeth and bones of this animal are sometimes used to make comb, buttons and other useful things. In some areas, the dung is used as fertiliser and to burn fires. In some parts of India, cows have significant religious meaning.\n\nThe cow is a four-footed animal and its skin is thick. Grasses are their main food and they are mostly domestic animals. The weight of adult cattle always depends on the breed and it can vary to a great extent. As per an online article that I read many years ago, cows have a well-developed sense of taste and they can distinguish the four primary tastes which are sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Interestingly, their hearing power is more acute than horses! Cows occupy a unique role in human history and they are living near human and been domesticated since at least the early neolithic age. The production of milk, which is also made into cheese, butter, yoghurt, and other dairy products provide an important part of the food supply for many of the world's people.\n\nI like this animal mostly because of its closeness to human and its usefulness for us. In my childhood, we had 5-6 cows at our home and they were very friendly. They had been very helpful for us. I like it as it is a very gentle and sober animal. I also enjoy when I see a cow is ruminating and giving milk to her calf."

However, since this cue card topic is asking me to do just that, I will go ahead and stick to the task as best as I can.\n\nHis name is “Lenin Gafur”. We became neighbours when he moved to my neighbourhood about a few years ago from another city for professional reason. Incidentally, I met him on the same day when he was moving his furniture and belonging to his new flat. He seemed like an easy-going fellow, who didn’t like to talk too much, even though he talked to me with a smile as long as the conversation had continued.  \n\nLenin Gafur is about the same age as me, but he looks a bit too old for a 32 years old person.  He wears looking glasses and likes to wear traditional dresses always. My neighbour is single and lives in a 2 bedroom flat which is about a couple of blocks from my own residence. He seems to be like a very busy person with his works as he returns to his residence pretty late almost every night, even though I manage to meet him every week at a commonplace of worship.\n\nBeing a “Senior Nurse” by profession, Lenin has a habit of asking all people, people he meets, about their detail health situation. I have even seen him providing necessary health tips to people around him whenever he gets an opportunity. I think that he is a good person for the most part except that he can get cranky if he hears any noise around his residence.\n\nAnyway, I think that I like my neighbour, mostly because he doesn’t poke his nose into the business of other people unnecessarily. I like him also because he seems to be a very hard-working person. Finally, I also like him because he is mild-mannered and always speaks with a smiley face."

    "Answer": "I’m lucky, I’ve got good neighbours. I’m going to tell you about just one of them, when we met, how often we meet and why I think he is a good neighbour who I like very much.\n\nI live in an old house which has been converted into about eleven different flats and bedsits. I live on the top floor, which is actually the modernised attic space of the original building, there is just one other flat in this roof area. To get to my flat, and that of my immediate next-door neighbour, you have to go up a back stairway that was probably originally the servants’ staircase, I think what is now my flat and that of my neighbour’s too, must have been at one time servants’ quarters. This means that our doorways are directly opposite one another, and we are the only people who use this entrance to the building.\n\nI moved into the flat I live in about five or six years ago now. It is a rented flat. At that time the flat opposite me was empty, but a few weeks later I met a woman a little bit older than me who was busy cleaning just inside the flat, but with the door wide open. I paused to introduce myself and talk to her. She was really friendly, and I found out it was her son who was to be my new neighbour, she was just helping him to move in. A bit later he, Oliver, turned up too. He was new to the area, so I explained where all the local shops were, when the rubbish was taken out and various other little details about the practicalities of living in the property. A couple of days later he knocked on my door and called round for a chat. We found we got on really well. We have a very similar sense of humour, a shared (but slightly half-hearted) interest in running, and a mutual appreciation of good food – I could recommend the deli over the road to him as a source of lovely upmarket cheeses, olives and home-made lasagne and delicious pasta and pesto sauce too. We also both have an unfulfilled wanderlust, always plotting our next journey. He is off to Australia soon, lucky him!\n\nGiven how close we live together, our front doors face directly onto one another, we see each other incredibly rarely. We both have busy lives, working full time but different hours. At weekends I tend to be out and about, and he’ll often disappear for the weekend to stay with his girlfriend. Even so, whenever we do meet, it is always friendly, we make each other laugh. We often end up having long conversations just chatting in the hallway outside our front doors. I probably see him only once a fortnight or so, but we leave each other notes too from time to time if we need help with anything.\n\nOliver is a great neighbour because I know I could call on him if I needed to. We will always help each other if we can. I dug his car out of the snow for him once as he didn’t have a shovel, but he’s returned the favour in other ways, taking in parcels for me when I’m away for example. Because I live on my own it is really important to me to have a neighbour close by that I trust and like. I was really sad when he told me he was planning to emigrate. I was also really pleased for him, you have to wish someone well when they are following their dreams. I hope my new next-door neighbour is half as nice!"

A little over a year later, my friend and his wife became the lucky parents of their first child, Robin Jr.  So, I guess that it is fair to suggest that I know this child from the day he came into this world.\n\nOf course, I didn’t exactly become too attached to this child from the beginning, obviously, because he was just a bit too “little” for my liking or attention, I must say. In fact, if anything, I actually tried to avoid getting close to that little baby boy even though my friend and his wife tried to build some kind of “uncle-nephew” connection between the baby and me. But, as he grew up a little and learned to make some eye contacts, I started to like the child.\n\nSince then, my relationship with the little 4-year-old child has been everything except dull and boring. Now, Robin Jr. and I seldom spend a day without meeting each other and enjoying either some ice cream together or having him a bicycle race with me while I am also pretending to be running with him. The 4-year-old loving but smart child also invites me to his place to watch some funny cartoons with him these days which I also pretend to enjoy a lot.   \n\nAnyway, I like this child because he seems to be very happy always. In fact, I have seldom seen him making a sad face or getting mad over anything. I also like this precious child because he can be satisfied with as little as a promise to buy him some chocolate next time if you can’t buy him any now."

    "Answer": "My grandfather had been the father of six children and later on when they became parents, the family grew up quite large. In our joint family, there are several children and among them, the youngest boy of my elder sister is the one I'd like to talk about. He is 4-5 years old and is my most favourite nephew. His name is Abraham and I call him Nir. I still remember the day he came to this world and I chose to name him Abraham. He lives with his parents in a different city and they visit us almost 3-4 times each year.\n\nFrom his childhood, he was very cute and adorable. I loved him very much and because of my affection towards him, he became very fond of me. I usually see him with an interval of 3/4 months and each time I get the feeling that he has grown up more.\n\nWe often play hide-and-seek and cricket together with other people and kids. He loves to listen to the ghost stories, adventurous stories and fairy stories. While their stay at our home, he stays with me at night and I tell him bedtime stories. We often go to walk in the field, go to open places like parks, near the river and forest. He likes ice-cream and I buy him chips, ice-creams and chocolates. He loves sweets and hates to eat any pungent food. I often cuddle him, make fun with him and play with him.\n\nMy affection and love for him are very profound and I love to spend time with him whenever possible."

    "Answer": "Visiting a river site is one of my most favourite things to do during the summertime, and if I am visiting a calm river, as opposed to the “violent” ones, that’s even better. Today, I would like to talk about one such calm river that I visited about a couple of years ago.\n\nThe river, I visited, was located about 50 kilometres away from my hometown in the countryside. It was a public place, so anybody could visit the beautiful river site. In fact, I would say that it is one of the most beautiful and scenic river sites, as well as one of the longest rivers in my country. Originally, starting its journey from one of our neighbouring countries, the river has left its traces of sediments on both sides of the sandy river while passing through a number of cities and regions of my country.\n\nAnyway, the side, which I was visiting with a few of my friends during the summertime couple of years ago, was protected by brick-built embankments. There were a number of restaurants and café on the riverside in order to provide refreshment facilities for its visitors. There were also many beautiful trees on the riverside which offered enough sitting arrangement for a significant number of visitors. Anyway, after arriving at the riverside, we first rented a large machine-operated boat to ride along the river water. After that, we also walked on the sandy bank of the river before resting at a café and enjoying some delicious snacks. By the way, I would recommend this place for others to visit because this could offer them a great escape from the busy city life.    \n\nAnyway, I liked this particular river site because it had all the ingredients to make me feel very closed to Mother Nature. I also liked this place because I didn’t have to spend a fortune in order to enjoy the beautiful nature. Finally, I liked it also because it allowed me an opportunity to spend some quality time with some of my best friends."

    "Answer": "I have once been at Cox's Bazar for about a week and really enjoyed my visit there. Cox's Bazar is considered to be the largest sea beach in the world and it is beside the Bay-of-Bengal. We had the trip to visit the sea, beach and natural beauty of this place.\n\nThree of our friends including me went there in 2010 probably around June. This was a good time to visit the sea beach. We stayed at a hotel which was very close to the sea. We could hear the roaring sounds of the sea from our hotel, especially at night. The sea seems endless and this was my first time to see the vastness of the sea. I tried to imagine the position of the other shore of the sea and the depth of it and after sometimes abandoned this silly idea! I was really surprised when we took a motorboat to visit a nearby island. All I could see was water around us. The waves were so enormous and high that I thought this would hit us hard and our boat would sink. I am not ashamed to disclose that I was a bit frightened about the big waves and our small boats.\n\nAt night I walked beside the sea, I watched the lives surrounding the sea, people and their culture. The moon looked like a hanging light in the wall on the other side of the sea. The sea looked less formidable at night, except the sound which was louder at night. Tourists from different locations, local people, fishermen, long sea beach and the sea itself exposed the aspects of life and places that we never knew about. I enjoyed fresh foods and fishes, different cultures of people, the vastness of the sea, the hotel, the working-class people and their mildness and have planned to visit the place again whenever possible."

    "Answer": "I like football, whether it is played between two international teams or local teams, as long as the teams give their best in the field. The sporting event, I would like to talk about, was a national club football tournament of my country that takes place every year.\n\nAnyway, the sporting event took place about 5 years ago, when two of the best football clubs of my country clashed against each other in a final match of the national football tournament. The two arch-rival teams had already clashed against each other in the past, and their number of wins was pretty much the same throughout the history of their clash, especially, in this tournament. So, essentially, nobody really knew which team was favourite to win the final.\n\nBut, when the game actually started, all the supporters of both the teams were screaming and encouraging their respective team as if they were bound to win. As a supporter, I also wanted my team to win at all costs.  Anyway, both teams were playing very “rough and tough” football that led to some unwanted “fouls” and some unfortunate “fistfight”.\n\nThe game continued scoreless up until the half time interval, but as the second half of the game started, the intensity of the game increased.  In the meanwhile, I was getting nervous in the stadium because my team wasn’t exactly playing up to our expectation. In fact, my team was lucky to survive a few scoring chances from the opponent team.  Then, suddenly, the ball was passed to the main “striker” of my favourite team from nowhere, and a goal was scored by my team, leaving the supporters of my team completely ecstatic and crazy with the feeling of a possible victory. And, in the end, we were indeed the victorious team.\n \nAnyway, I consider this sporting event to be interesting because we never know which team is going to win. Besides, I consider this sporting event exciting also because it attracts supporters from all over my country. Finally, it is interesting also because no other sporting event makes us as emotional as this one."

    "Answer": "I attended the Asia Cup final cricket tournament that was held at Dhaka Stadium in the year 2002 or 2003. We went to Dhaka to watch the game and stayed at a hotel during this time. I had 3-4 friends and a cousin with me from the very beginning. We have had our ticket for almost 3 months before the game started. On the day we left the hotel early morning and took a taxi to reach near the stadium. We found a huge crowd there; in fact, the crowd was much more than we anticipated and expected. I found one of my friends wearing the jersey of a team and others whistles. The crowd and their patience in the line gave the impression of how much popular this game over here.\n\nI had a flag with me of the team I supported. We had to stay in line for about 45 minutes before we finally entered the stadium. I simply became overwhelmed with the sheer number of spectators and their festivity and support for the game.\n\nThe game started at 10.00 am and the people were enjoying it very much. The game was really enjoyable and I found supporters for both of the team. The crowd, the music, the competition, the excitement of the game, and the liveliness and spontaneous actions of the spectators were noteworthy. After the first team ended their innings, we went outside and were looking for a hotel to eat. But people were everywhere and there was no seat in the hotel. Finally, we got an empty hotel after walking for almost 20 minutes and sat there to have our lunch. We returned to the stadium in 35 minutes and the second innings started. Several TV channels were broadcasting the live game and the number of people watching this very game in the world would not be less than 70 million.  \n\nThe first team scored 280 and that was a good fighting score at that time. The second team started hammering the bowls from the very beginning. It seemed to me that they would not need more than 30 overs to win the game. But they started losing wickets and in 20 overs they lost 3 wickets. The spirit and excitement of the spectators looked like a waving sea. The team I was supporting started doing really good. In the evening the game started turning in favour of the first team and became very close. Cricket is a game of uncertainty and this game became even more competitive and uncertain. Both teams had the chance to win and the game was changing in every 10 minutes. The last 30 minutes were breathless and extremely exciting and finally the team I was supporting won the match.  \n\nThis event takes place once in every two years, and the schedule and venue are selected and maintained by the ICC. This was my first experience to visit Dhaka as well as watching such an exciting match. I have watched a few other cricket matches in the stadium, but none of them was as exciting as this one was. The crowd, the enthusiasm of the people and the superb weather made it an interesting one."

    "Answer": "Gosh, this topic is hard for me, I don’t really go to many sporting events, and it isn’t especially an interest of mine. However, I can think of one which enticed me to go and watch, I’ll tell you as much as I can about the event, how often it takes places and why it was, to me at least, interesting!\n\nThe sporting event I went to was Le Tour de France – except it wasn’t! For one year only the opening stages took place near to where I live in South Yorkshire, but more of that later.\n\nThe event is a world-famous cycling race. It takes place every year, in a series of stages which are mainly in France, but it does occasionally pass through other countries. I think it started around 1903 and has taken place each year since then – apart from during the two world wars when obviously it was suspended. The cyclists are professional riders, and the tour is gruelling. The route changes each year, but always includes both hilly and mountain stages, fast flat sections and covers a huge distance of some three and a half thousand kilometres over about 23 days. I am told there are about 20 teams or so each year, each with nine riders. To be honest, I get very confused about how it is all timed and organised, but I do know that for each stage, the rider who has completed it in the fastest time gets to wear a yellow jersey for the next stage of the tour.\n\nThe race has fallen foul of cheating over the years, famously Lance Armstrong who won it some seven times I think was later banned for drug-taking. However, more recently cycling has cleaned up its act and gained in popularity. In 2014, a decision was made to have the Grand Depart – the start of the Tour de France in South Yorkshire. This part of England where I live has fantastic scenery and very, very steep hills that were deemed suitably challenging of the super-fit and competitive cyclists. Although I’ve never previously been interested in cycling, some of my friends are, and with such a world-famous event happening on my doorstep I wouldn’t have wanted to miss out.\n\nOn the day of the race itself, lots of roads were closed. I met up with some friends and we caught a tram as far out of the city as we could, and then walked the final stages to a good viewing point along the route. I had no idea what to expect but it was amazing! The weather was gorgeous, and Yorkshire and Sheffield folk had turned out in droves.  I think about 2.5 million of us lined the route over the weekend it was passing through. I climbed up a bank and hung onto a tree to get a good vantage point as the cyclists raced through in the peloton (a new word for me that I learned whilst spectating). To be completely honest, the actual cyclists passed by in an instant, what made the event fun to watch was the build-up and the atmosphere. The race was led by a convoy of floats and support vehicles. There was lots of good-natured banter and sharing of food and snacks as the crowds waited for the bikes to come, and plenty of people in hilarious fancy dresses on French or cycling themes. Bunting was hanging everywhere, and brightly painted yellow bikes were scattered along the route. The weather showed off our Yorkshire hills and scenery at its very best, it was awesome!\n\nI was really proud to be one of the supporters on what was a once in a lifetime opportunity to see The Tour de France passing through practically on my doorstep (I live in Sheffield). The race director for the event later described Yorkshire's Grand Depart as the \"grandest\" in the 111-year history of the race, it was wonderful to be part of that… it hasn’t made me want to take up cycling, though – those hills are ferocious!"

So, I am really glad that I am getting an opportunity today to talk about something useful which I learned from a member of my family.\n\nI used to live in an extended family, which included my old grandparents, parents, brothers and sisters along with my paternal uncles, aunts and cousins, where we all used to share pretty much everything with each other. I was the youngest member of my family. Anyway, as an extended family, my family members used to strictly follow some family codes, and one of those codes was that each of my family members, except me because of my young age, would try his or her best to donate a certain amount of money into a family fund.\n\nBy the way, the arrangement of such family fund was made by none other than my old grandmother because she wanted to make sure that we all were able to deal with any kind of emergency financial situation. Anyway, it was at that time I learned the importance of saving up money even whether I was earning enough or not, and I carried this important lesson into my life from high school to university and then also to my professional life.\n\nIn fact, this money-saving habit had allowed me to save up enough money to buy some good shares in the share market right after starting my new job about 10 years ago. Now, I am glad to say that I taught this valuable important life lesson also to my young wife and two of my younger cousins.\n\nAnyway, the lesson was important for me because it allowed me to understand the value of money if I really wanted to live a decent life. Besides, it was important for me also because it allowed me the liberty and satisfaction of exploring my true potential and worth as a positive and intelligent person."

    "Answer": "I grew up in a joint family with more than 12 family members. They were my parents, siblings, grandma, grandpa, uncle, aunt and cousins. I had the chance to learn so many things from them and it is, in fact, natural that a kid would learn things from his/her family members. I have learned swimming from my uncle, learned the painting from my aunt, learned to play chess from my grandpa, learned to play cricket and badminton from my brother and so on and on. I have learned how to handle the stress and adverse time from my parents and learned how to behave with unknown people from my elder cousin. Thus the list would be a very long one. But I would like to emphasise the thing that I learned from my younger aunt and that is the reading habit and the pleasure of reading. Not that other things I learned from other family members are of less importance, but the reading for please and true interest in reading that I learned from my aunt is different and have great power.\n\nI found my aunt very charming, caring and possesses a great personality. She had been a voracious reader and because of that, she was more learned and wise than people of her age. Initially, I thought that how come she spends most of her time reading? Over time, I became close to her, and she started helping me with my studies. She started inspiring me to read books other than my academic books. She read me stories and that help me grow an interest in books. Then she started telling me amazing stories of our history and showed me which books actually have those histories written.   \n\nShe shared the stories she was reading and thus we started becoming a good critic of stories and writers. She told me more stories that I have heard from anyone else. I am grateful to her that she so painstakingly explained different topics and help me grow a good interest in reading. Because of her contribution, I have started reading books of different types whenever I got time which I think is a better investment and activity than spending time idly.\n\nLater I have inspired my nephew to read books. I did the same, I read him stories which would be interesting to him and gave him sweets, candies, ice-cream if he could have finished a book and explain the stories. I guess he has become interested in reading as well."

However, it is even better to learn how to fix or repair a computer in the process of playing with it because I actually consider it to be a great practical skill in today’s world.\n\nAnyway, I am glad to say that I know how to repair a computer whether it has a hardware problem or software problem. Of course, when I say that I know how to fix a computer, I don’t necessarily mean that I would be able to fix all kinds of computer problems just like an expert professional quickly. Rather, all I am suggesting that I am skilled enough to try different kinds of remedies and techniques to fix a computer whether it has a problem in its network settings, video graphic card, RAM or computer cable.  \n\nBy the way, there can be so many types of computer problems that it would be almost impossible to list them all.  Anyway, in order to learn this skill, I have opened a computer several times to understand the physical relationships among their different parts, only to find out, of course, that I would need a lot more time to call myself an expert in this particular field. But, I am still glad that I get to use my computer repairing skill every once in a while not only to fix my own computer but also the computers of my friends and other people around me. Besides, I would also like to thank the senior computer lab assistant at my junior college who was kind enough to teach me this great practical skill.\n\nAnyway, this skill helps me greatly because I can fix most of my computer problems on my own without spending any money most of the times. Besides, I also get some extra respect and attention at my work because of this skill, since I can use this skill to fix some of the computer problems at my work."

I took a 2-years diploma course on designing and have worked for the card, banner, poster, logo and web designing. Besides, I have learned how to build web pages after designing it.\n\nI have gained the skill by practising a lot. I read different books on designing how to and concepts, spent numerous hours designing and learned many things from the teachers who used to take our classes. I have learned many designing aspects, tips and tutorials from different design-related websites as well.\n\nPractice and the opportunity to work on several tasks helped me master the skill. I still need a long way to go and I am still a passionate designer. Besides my academic study, I still work on designing specifically on freelancing projects and that brings me a good amount of money.\n\nI am sure this skill will help me do even better in the professional sector in the future."

But, when it actually comes to give my opinion on them, I always try to stay away from them for some obvious reasons. But, today, I would like to about an occasion when I felt that letting my opinion to be heard was important.\n\nThe survey, I took part in, involved collecting opinions on whether public smoking should have been criminalized or not, and one could just say either “yes” or “no” when giving his or opinion on this issue.\n\nAnyway, I found the survey, organized by a famous national NGO of my country, to be an important one because I also considered public smoking to be a serious problem for the city in which I was living in back then. In fact, in its introduction of the survey, the NGO concluded with various statistics that almost 80% of the adult males in my home city were a smoker. The NGO also mentioned how smoking had led to a gradual increase in the number of people who were becoming affected by respiratory problems one way or another.\n\nEven more dangerous was the fact that many high school going students were becoming addicted to smoking when attending their schools. So, all in all, it was a dangerous trend for the people of my home city as far as their health was concerned. By the way, I was asked to take part in the survey, primarily because I fell in the category of non-smoking people who had graduated from a university, and my response in the survey was that I wanted public smoking to be criminalized.\n\nAnyway, I felt really great about giving my opinion in the survey as it would help my city to raise some kind of awareness against public smoking. I also felt glad that this survey would go a long way to saving our city government in its health costs which could then be used to address other problems in my city. So, all in all, it was a great feeling for me."

I was a student of 7th semester then and I actively participated in University debate team. Our team did well in different contents and then our university administration took this seriously. As part of their initiatives, they conducted a survey to gather information what can be done to make the team even better. As far as I recall, it was Friday evening and after reaching the 6th floor of our university debate team room, I heard that we will have a session in the auditorium. We left the room and went to the auditorium. I was amazed to notice some of the high-level administrative officials in the hall and then learned that they would be discussing the debate team we have.\n\nThey congratulated us and promised that they would help the team and the association every way possible so that we can practice and do even better in the future. As part of the discussion, the debate team members, trainers and associated members were asked to take part in a survey. After I got the survey papers and pen, I found that that was a questionnaire of 2 pages and there were approximately 20 questions there. Most of the questions were multiple choices but there were 5-6 questions that asked to write our comments or thoughts. The topic of the survey was (as far as remember): \"How initiatives can be taken and what improvements can be done to make our university debate team even better\". As a debate team member and an active debater, I was naturally asked to participate in the survey to express my opinion.\n\nI mostly express what should be done to make the debate team a good one, appreciated the university authority's help so far and specifically mentioned what are the difficulties we have faced and what are the steps that should be taken to eradicate this issues. I was excited that the upper administration was taking notice on our debate team and when they conducted the survey, I felt really good and kind of honoured to be the part of the team. I have been involved in the debate team for about 2 years and with very little help from the university fund and administration we started doing better and after the session and survey, I felt it was worthy to be the part of the extra curriculum activities.\n\nThe overall experience was good and that's why I still remember this survey; even after I took part in many different marketing and online surveys, this one was special to me."

But, the problem is we can’t really enjoy life enough unless we also enjoy doing something healthy from time to time. Of course, different people enjoy doing different kinds of healthy activities, but as far as I am concerned, it is swimming.\n\nI enjoy swimming. In fact, swimming was one of my most favourite hobbies when I was growing up as a child as I would hardly let any day pass by during the summertime without swimming, whether I was swimming in a lake or a big river. Besides, one of the greatest advantages of living in the countryside (yes, I grew up in the countryside until I started attending high school) of my country is that it almost certainly would have some natural lakes or rivers to invite those who would like to swim.\n\nOf course, the difference is that when I was growing up as a child, I used to enjoy swimming just for the fun of it, but today, I do swimming because it helps me remain healthy. Besides, these days, I swim mostly in a local swimming pool as the city, in which I live now, doesn’t have many natural lakes, rivers or any ocean where I would be able to enjoy this activity better. Anyway, I enjoy this healthy activity with a bunch of other guys (they are not related to me in any respect), and I do this every weekend if not more. By the way, I am trying to form a swimming club in my city in order to make swimming more of a fun activity rather than considering it as only a healthy activity.\n\nAnyway, I think that swimming is a healthy activity because it forces each and every part of our bodies to engage in perfect sync with each other in order to keep us floating in the water. Besides, it also helps me relax after a long week of work by allowing me to forget about the worries of my daily life for a while."

Waking up very early and then doing the physical exercise is the healthy habit I have developed from the early stage of my life.\n\nI remember my father insisting us to wake up very early and then took us to the nearby high school ground for exercise. Nowadays, I wake up from bed at around 5:30 am and wear my exercise trousers and a pair of shoes. Then I start walking along with the road that has passed beside the river. The fresh air in the morning is very healthy for health. Sometimes I take my bicycle and instead of walking, I ride my cycle. I started doing this early morning exercise and swimming a few years back but nowadays 2 of my friends and cousins accompany me almost every day. They enjoy doing exercise very much.\n\nThe morning is a time when the air and environment remain fresher than at any time of the day. So breathing the fresh air, doing the exercises and finally swimming in the freshwater is definitely a very healthy habit. A sound mind lies on a sound body and this habit that I adopted is pretty helpful for keeping sound health and a sound mind."

Anyway, today I would like to talk about a sport, which I enjoy playing the most like millions of others in my country.\n\nThe name of this sport is football. In fact, football by far is the most popular sport in my country, followed by Golf, especially after the modern Myanmar national football league was formed in the year of 2009.  Besides, football has a long and rich tradition in my country as used to be one of the best Asian teams along with Iran and South Korea, winning Asian Games football tournaments twice, in 1966 and 1970, as well as being runner up in the 1968 Asian Cup, after the champion and host Iran. Myanmar youth team had also crowned Asian youth championship titles seven times.\n\nAnyway, when I was younger, I could play this sport anywhere in our streets, where I lived, with my friends and neighbours because back then, the streets were not really that busy.  But, as I've grown up now, I only play this great sport in the field by dividing ourselves, including my friends and neighbours, in two teams, with 11 players in each, and we play like true professionals. In fact, we even organize a “friendly cup” football tournament for our wards (“ward” is a local city authority in my country) in our town every year where the champion team receives an award.\n\nIn fact, when our “ward” team plays in this friendly cup football tournament, we support our own teams by chanting and screaming for them so that they become spirited and energized to score goals.\n\nAnyway, I enjoy this sport because it allows me to socialize and mingle with my friends and neighbours while also having fun in the field. The game helps me recuperate from the fatigue and tiredness of my busy working life.  Finally, the sport also allows me to remain physically fit and healthy like no other game."

    "Answer": "I've played several games throughout my young age, both indoor and outdoor games, and I try to play whenever I get time. Among those games, I enjoyed playing chess more than others. Chess is an indoor game where two players participate. This game does not involve any major physical movements like other outdoor games but a chess player has to use his/her brain and make game plans to defeat the opponent.\n\nI mostly play this game with my friends and cousins. Sometimes I play it with my father and senior relatives. Since playing chess requires only placing the board on a surface and sitting position of the two participating players, it is convenient to play chess almost anywhere. I mostly play it at our veranda, garden or bedroom. I enjoy this game because I have a fascination for this game from my childhood and I really like the overall theme and barnstorming involved in this game. It's a thought-provoking game that gives the participating players to use their brains. A player can apply his/her strategy, and then allure the opponent to fall into a trap which is much like a real battlefield.\n\nIt's not a game where someone would only use the physical movements rather the game requires a perfect game plan, finding weaknesses of the opponent and a battle strategy. This game gives you a feel of being the King of a regime where you decide your country men's fate. For all those reasons this is a very interesting and enjoyable game for me."

    "Answer": "Iran, my country, is a land of vast deserts, majestic mountains and verdant valleys with rushing streams, where we enjoy life to the fullest. I am really proud to have an opportunity to grow up in this country as a girl where I have gone through a lot of memorable experiences as a child. Today, I would like to share one such memorable experience here.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, when I was a young child, there was a traditional family gathering at my home after a marriage ceremony. Many of my family members had gathered at my house to enjoy the \"get-together\" event and some of them were enjoying their little talks among each other while the others were enjoying playing “Iranian rummy” (card game) with each other in a group. The group, which was playing rummy, had 6 people in it, including my mother and aunt. By the way, as a child, I had always wanted to play that interesting card game, but my parents, especially my mother, never allowed me to learn it because I was too young to play that game.  So, all I used to do was enjoy the game just by sitting close to the rummy players. However, knowing that my request to join the game with my mother would get flatly denied, I still requested her to let me play with them. And, that’s when I got the most surprising and pleasing response from my mother, as she actually allowed me to play the rummy with her for the first time, which made me feel like I was jumping in the moon with joy and happiness.\n\nAnyway, it is one of the most memorable childhood experiences, primarily because it made me feel for the first time, that I was actually growing up as a girl. Besides, the experience also allowed me the opportunity to enjoy the game by actually playing it with others instead of enjoying it from distance. Besides, I would never forget the night when my mother looked at me with a very loving and motherly smile on her face after seeing me happy."

    "Answer": "Childhood is a time when everything is magical and pleasant. The possibility and dreams are vast and things become happier in childhood. Everybody has childhood memories and among them some are pleasant and some are sad. I have various childhood memories and I would like to talk about my childhood memory related to my first day at school.\n\nI was about 5 years old when my parents got me admitted to a local school. I had a fascination of going to school from 3-4 years as I recall and when my father finally announced that I'll get admitted in the coming January, I felt like being in heaven.\n\nI imagined the school would be a great place and I would have lots of friends and I would study there. On the day, my parents took me to the school that I saw in the past many times from outside but never entered. After entering the school, I find myself anxious about everything.\n\nI was unsure what to do, who to talk to, what to do when the teachers would ask questions and many such things. After my father submitted some necessary papers and fees to the admission department, they gave me new books, a temporary Identity Card and a syllabus. I started feeling comfortable after I found that some of our neighbouring kids were already in this very school and they came to me and talked to me. This took place in my hometown where I grew up and I had been to this school for the next 4 years.\n\nTo my surprise, one of the teachers asked my parents to leave me and told me to attend the classes. I was not at all prepared to join the class but I found I had little choice over that. My parents spent a few times and advised me how to behave, how to listen to teachers and many more tips. After my parents abandoned me, I was frightened for a few moments and sat at a corner of the class. The teacher asked to come forward and introduce myself. I found I was unable to walk and talk. But in a few minutes, my hesitation got away and I was talking about myself.\n\nThe teacher appreciated me and some of the new classmates came forward and greeted me. I started enjoying the class and teachers and found that I started loving my school. Later on, I got admitted to college, university and many other places but the memory of the first day at primary school was totally different and I still remember the day evidently."

    "Answer": "Living in London is a wonderful experience, whether you are a local or a foreigner. Its vibrant multi-cultural society, fashion, food and nightlife would fascinate any girl like me, especially when she studies arts and music.  Anyway, while I like all these things, I also like the wonderful theatrical performances at some of the London theatres. Today, I would like to talk about one such theatrical performance that I enjoyed about a few months ago.\n\nThe name of this the theatrical show was “Les Miserables Musical” based on the novel by writer Victor Hugo published more than 156 years ago.  By the way, this novel is considered to be one of the greatest novels of the nineteenth century which analyzes the French society of his time, by reasoning about good and evil, about law, politics, ethics, justice, and the religion.\n\nAnyway, the show nineteenth-century France, during the events of the June 1832 insurrection, when Jean Valjean, an ex-convict, was seeking redemption after serving a nineteen-year prison term for stealing just a loaf of bread. Unable to find an honest job because of his past, Valjean decides to break his parole in hope of starting a new life under a false identity with the help of a bishop while suffering the relentless persecution of Inspector Javert over the years. Despite Jean Valjean’s lifelong struggle for redemption, police inspector Javert refuses to believe that Valjean can actually change his ways of life. In the end, Jean becomes an exemplary man who fights against misery and injustice and decides to take charge of Cosette, a little girl, which changed his life forever. This masterpiece of the musical theatre took place at the Sondheim Theatre, London.\n\nAnyway, it was a 'worth watching theatrical performance' because the quality of the production and acting was superb. It was worth watching also because the show perfectly portrayed the real pictures behind the French revolution with the touch of class and realism, like no other shows, with a master class display of costumes, make-up and set design."

    "Answer": "Three years ago I watched the play 'Romeo & Juliet' by William Shakespeare at the city theatre that I consider a worth watching theatrical performance. The play lasted for about 1 and a half hour and I as well as the 200 audiences of the play thoroughly enjoyed and acclaimed the play.\n\nThe city theatre is famous for quality performance by the top-class performers. The time when we heard that a team is coming from London to perform Romeo and Juliet, we planned to watch it. We knew very little about the actors and actresses but heard that they are quite popular in the theatrical world in London. After the play began I noticed a pin drop silence on the theatre except the performers' voices and background music. The costumes of the performers were just the way it should be. Their dresses, stage, music, their makeup, their accent, the passionate acting created an illusion of real Romeo-Juliet era. The play went on and the story continued as - \"Two young people fall in love the moment they met but their families are bitter enemies. The relationship between Romeo & Juliet fueled the anger and bitterness of the two families. The two innocent lovers get caught in the middle of a trap.\"\n\nThe tragic end of their lives and the eternal victory of love described in Shakespeare's gorgeous language makes it a worth watching theatrical performance.\n\nThe professional and astounding acting, captivating dialogues, intense romantic tale, wrenching separation and the tragic twist of the tale make the play unforgettable and timeless. The production and acting were superb and highly acclaimed. I still remember a news article later on that acclaimed the actors, actresses of the London team and the superb professionalism and artistic production of a great play."

    "Answer": "We all go through some life-changing experiences at some points of our life which eventually help us become the person we are. I also have gone through such life-changing experiences in my life, and I would like to share one of them today.\n\nIt was about 15 years ago when I was still a young child and was living with my parents in a busy city. Back then, I also liked to go out with my parents like any other children, whether they were going to do some grocery shopping or visiting a stadium to watch an interesting game. But, the rule was, when going outside anywhere with my parents, I needed to remain close to them all the time, no matter what the situations outside would be.\n\nOf course, I tried to stick to the rule as best as I could all the times, except on one occasion, when my parents had taken me to a stadium to watch a football match. If I remember it correctly, it was a final match between two prominent football clubs in my country, and the stadium was packed with thousands of spectators. After the match was over, my parents were very excited and celebrating with other supporters outside of the stadium, and with them, I also was in a celebratory mood. But, while everybody was busy celebrating the victory, I suddenly found myself in a huge crowd which didn’t include my parents. In other words, I was lost as I probably had forgotten the advice of my parents for a while.  \n\nNaturally, I felt very scared after getting lost and stood still where I was, hoping that my parents would find me.  Not sure, how long I had waited in the crowd, but my parents luckily found me later on.  \n\nNeedless to say, this scary incident changed my life for better, because after this incident, I have always listened to my parents and their advice, whether I liked them or not. Besides, it was after this incident that I started to exercise maximum vigilance wherever I would travel."

    "Answer": "I was only 6 or 7 years old then and went to visit my grandpa in our village. I had lots of cousins and many of them were similar to my age. Visiting the village was very exciting for me. One day I along with my cousins went to play in the evening and all of a sudden we decided to catch some fishes from the nearby pond. We had no hook or net to catch fishes so we decided to do it with our bare hands.\n\nThere were no people around so no one was there to warn us. As we did not know how to swim and had no idea about the depthless of the river, we lost control and all of a sudden I found that I and my cousin were trying to get out of the water. We already got ourselves trapped in the deep water and were struggling to breathe. I barely remember what happened except that I was trying with my last effort to fight with water and get into the land. I can't recall how much time had spent but suddenly I found that I was lying on my mother's lap and was trying to find my cousin who faced the same fate as I did.\n\nLater I heard that both of us were almost sinking in the water and an old woman came to rescue us. She was a village dweller who came to take water from the pond and had noticed us. She single-handedly rescued me and then my cousin.\n\nThis event was a life-changing event for me. After that event, I learned how important it is to stay closer to parents and to heed to their advice. I also learned how fleeting our lives are and we out to help each other. From then I also started respecting all sort of people of all ages and always believed in humanity. When we are in danger, human (known and unknown) would come to rescue us. So we should never disrespect the human and always keep faith in them.\n\nThe tragic part is that the grandson of the old woman who saved us died in the water of a river. Knowing it I started strongly believing in fates and then the tests we are bound to face in our lives."

    "Answer": "Thank you for allowing me the time to talk about this cue card topic. Spain is a very beautiful country, and it has many interesting holiday destinations to talk about. Today I would like to about one such interesting holiday destination which I have already visited once.\n\nThe name of this fascinating holiday destination is 'Gran Canaria Island'. Being considered as the third largest island in canaries’ archipelago, it is located off northwestern Africa. It lives up to its reputation as a continent in miniature, with dramatic variations of terrain ranging from the green and leafy north to the lush mountainous interior and the desert south.\n\nYou can, in fact, run headlong into three or even four seasons in one day to capture the breathtaking natural diversity of this stunningly beautiful island. By the way, this holiday destination is also known for its black lava and white sandy beaches.  However, apart from its breathtaking diversity and dramatic terrain variations, I like this island particularly because of its climate pretty much guarantees sunshine and warm temperatures throughout the entire year with temperatures ranging between 20 and 30 degrees. I like this destination also because it is much more affordable than many other Mediterranean resorts. Finally, of course, I like it also because there are plenty of things to see and do there, including visiting Palmitas bird park to see a range of exotic birds and tropical fauna, climbing rocks, seeing sand dunes, and visiting the house of Christopher Columbus and fascinating archaeological cave site, among other things.\n\nAnyway, the best time to visit Gran Canaria is between April and October, even though the main tourist season is between December and March.\n\nI consider this to be a very interesting holiday destination because I can have a holiday here in spring, summer and autumn with loads of different activities with its temperatures remaining unchanged throughout the year.  Besides, its extraordinary terrains, reminiscent of a Martian surface or a lunar landscape, together with picturesque white villages, makes Gran Canaria a very exciting holiday destination for the visitors of all ages."

Of course, this pressure doesn’t become much of an issue for some people while, for others, it can have some very negative effects on their life. Anyway, with or without negative effects, I also have to deal with stressful days at work, and today I would like to talk about one such day.\n\nThe day started perfectly well as I woke up at the right time in that morning like every other day and arrived at the office also just on time. But as soon as I started to work on my scheduled task list, I found out that my email was not working. But, I needed to open my emails badly because there were some important files and documents which I needed to download to prepare an urgent sales audit report for our corporate head office. After trying a while, I gave up to open my email and straight headed to the room of our IT guy, only to find out that the IT guy had called sick and that he wouldn’t come to the office for the whole day.\n\nWhile waiting nervously, my Managing Director suddenly asked me to see him in his room, and I immediately knew that something was wrong.  In fact, he reprimanded me because my junior product manager, working under my supervision, had sent the wrong product to one of our clients, and the client had informed my MD about the mistake. My boss also told me that I, as a senior manager, was also responsible for the mistake. Later on, I just kept wishing that the day would just pass by as soon as possible with no more stress to deal with.\n\nAnyway, it was a stressful day for me because I was not able to do my works the way I was supposed to do. Besides, I was also lagging behind the schedules for the other important tasks. It was stressful even more also because I couldn’t actually find anybody to help me out to get the job done properly."

    "Answer": "There are many stressful days I remember from University as well as from work and out of those, I would like to talk about a stressful day at my work. It was a project deadline that we were supposed to deliver before the Christmas holiday. It was due at 15th December 2-3 years back and we were in a good ground to deliver the task to the client. It was a major client of our company and the project was a crucial one for the client as well.\n\nWe were 8 people involved in this project and on 12th December we revised the project and found that we need to review only before sending the final version of the software application. Next two days were days off and all of a sudden I got a call from my office that something went wrong regarding the project and the software was not running as expected. I came to the office at around 9.00 am on Saturday and found other members had already come or on their way to my office.\n\nInitially, we thought that there would be few bugs on our code and that should not take more than 2-3 hours for us to fix them. But to our surprise, we found that the code is a mess and nothing is in order. We started revising the code and found that some of the files had been overridden by newer files which were completely empty. We felt like the sky had just fallen down on our heads and we are in the middle of a deserted area. We all looked at the project manager who was busy talking to the product owner and could guess the hot conversation.\n\nI found some of my files were missing from the project and the backup system was not working. We spent 2-3 hours discussing the situation and tried to find out what should we do. The project manager explained we have no other choice but to work on the missing files all again to make it work.\n\nI was very tired and was getting calls from home to attend a family occasion. I felt really helpless and could not be sure if I should leave for a few hours to attend the family occasion or not. I explained to the project manager that I have to attend the occasion and then I will get back to the office. He agreed and I ran home. From there we went to a relative's house and again I came back to the office in the afternoon. I found that things were as they were before I left office and everybody became worried about the project.\nWe worked till 11.30 pm and then decide to let the client know the real situation. We emailed the owner and then emailed to the client that, we would need a few more days to finish the project. On that day when I returned home at around 12:45 am, I felt very stressed and tired. I wished the next day would be different.\n\nWe had to work quite hard for the next few days to make things right. And most surprisingly we had been able to deliver the project to the client on 20th December. Though it made some trouble to the client, he was so understanding and cooperative that he did not complain about it and appreciated us for the hard work."

    "Answer": "Canada is one of the most diverse and largest countries in the world, and the festivals there also go to reflect this diversity of this country by attracting people from all religions, races and cultures. Today, I would like to talk about one such festival, which is not only distinct from other festivals in my country but also is considered to be a national festival in Canada.\n\nThe name of this festival is called “Canada Day”. Being celebrated every year on July 1st, Canada day is considered to be a statutory holiday, meaning a large percentage of the population gets the day off and in turn, many retailers, government offices, libraries, schools, and services shut down.\n\nThis festival takes place in order to mark the anniversary of the effective date of the constitution act of 1867 which eventually led to the formation of the union of the British North America provinces in a common federation under the name of Canada. It is also worth mentioning that this Canada Day holiday is comparable to the Fourth of July celebration in the U.S. but with slightly less ceremonious and on a more \"Canadian\" scale.\n\nAnyway, on this day, most communities across the country host \"organized celebrations\" by holding outdoor public events, such as parades, carnivals, festivals, barbecues, air and maritime shows, fireworks, and free musical concerts, as well as citizenship ceremonies. However, it is also worth mentioning that there is no standard mode of celebration for Canada Day, and the locus of the celebrations is the national capital, Ottawa, Ontario, where large concerts and cultural displays are held on Parliament Hill in an event largely referred to as the \"Noon Show.\n\nAnyway, this festival is important for me and people in my country mainly because it reminds us about a great part of our history that eventually led to the independence of our country from its colonial masters after a long political process. It is important also because it brings all our citizens together in order to develop a sense of common unity and solidarity in all of them."

This is the occasion that people celebrates with great joy, hope, festivity and different cultural and other programs.\n\nNew Year is the time when a new calendar year begins and the year count is incremented. According to the Gregorian calendar, this festival falls on the first January each year.\n\nPeople start the arrangement to celebrate this festival about one week prior to the 1st of January. On the 31st night, people gather together, eat western foods and sometimes the traditional foods, make prayer for the prosperity of for the New Year and stay awake till late night to enjoy the night.\n\nIn my country, people groom well on the first of January. To some extent, people believe that the first January is important to them as it the starting of a new year. They believe that remaining happy, eating good foods and wearing nice clothes would make them happy and prosperous for the whole year.\n\nPeople greet others, give and receive gifts, visit the amusement parks and do many other activities. Some fares held on for the occasion and a great gathering is observed there.  So of the big trade fares, book fares start on the 1st day of the year.\n\nThis is an important festival for us. We along with the whole world take this day as an important festival day. In our tradition, we start the year with the hope of eliminating the bitterness and failure of the past year and start a 'fresh year' with the hope of fortune and happiness."

    "Answer": "People of my country, Bangladesh, love to prepare all kinds of food, traditional or not, and eat them whether there is an occasion for it or not. Of course, when talking about preparing traditional meals, there are just too many of them to choose. However, today, I would like to about a meal which I don’t only like to enjoy, but also prepare it myself from time to time.\n\nThe name of this meal in my language is called “vegetable Khichuri” or “Hotchpotch” in plain English. Even though this particular meal is traditionally enjoyed mostly during the rainy day, its savoury taste, along with its easy cooking methods, makes it a very popular food item pretty much for all occasions.\n\nSo, what is exactly a “khichuri” or Bangladeshi version of hotchpotch? Well, in plain English, it is a food which is prepared by combining mainly rice and lentils, together with a number of spices. However, this popular food item achieves its ultimate height of taste when it is also prepared by mixing either eggs and meats or vegetables.\n\nAnyway, in order to prepare a vegetable khichuri, we first wash rice and lentils and soak them together in cold water for 40 minutes. After draining the water from the mixture, we mix them with a paste of turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and cumin powder. Then, whole chilli and cumin seeds are also added in the heated oil of a pan, and once they start to pop up, onions and ginger are added to sauté them till light brown. After that, we add rice and lentils with everything and boil them until they are properly cooked. Finally, we add some cinnamon powder to it, once cooked, and cover the pan for 30 minutes.\n\nPeople in my country enjoy this particular meal because it tastes so delicious and yet very easy to digest because it is prepared mostly with vegetables and almost no fat. They enjoy this meal also because they don’t really need any other things to eat with it. It is just a perfect meal by itself."

    "Answer": "Tandoori chicken with paratha is a traditional mean that we prepare in our country on many different occasions. This is a famous meal in our country and people can have them from some restaurants but they prepare this meal during festivals at home.\n\nTandoori chicken is originally Punjabi dish that we adopted and this dish consists of roasted chicken with spices, testing salt and yoghurt. This meal is usually prepared in a cylindrical clay oven, a tandoor, in which this dish is usually prepared. The city people usually buy this special oven which is made of steel or metal but in a village, people make the oven with mud and wood.\n\nThe paratha is a special kind of baked bread. Usually, the paratha is made from wheat flatbread and then dough with cooking oil or ghee. We have this meal for almost all occasions. Not necessarily this is the only meal we prepare in our festivals but this is a very common meal along with other traditional meals. People love to have this meal in festivals and it seems like they usually assume that this is something they must prepare for the guests. In the different parts of the country, this meal gets some other variation in terms of the cooking process, presentation and ingredients, but they are almost same in all part and the custom of making it in a festival is quite common.\n\nFrom my childhood, I have always found this meal delicious and very common during festivals. So psychologically and in terms of its great taste, I love to eat this meal. Our people have a good hand on preparing delicious meals and as a traditional meal, we enjoy it very much. For me, I don't have the chance to eat this meal always as I live in a city far away from our hometown. So during the festival when I stay in my hometown, I really enjoy a known meal which is delicious and traditional to us."

    "Answer": "In today’s busy world, it is really difficult to single out a particular household appliance as the most useful one because all of them seem to smooth out our lives one way or another. But, for the sake of our cue card topic today, I would go ahead and pick one household item as the most useful, as far as its benefits are concerned.\n\nThe name of this household item is the “washing machine”.  A washing machine is a machine that washes dirty clothes. Comparing to other popular technology today, a washing machine uses a rather simple one, in which, hot and cold water enters through pipes near the top of the machine, passing through the detergent tray and flushing the detergent into the machine.\n\nDuring the wash cycle, a large plastic agitator turns around with real force in order to remove the dirt from the clothes by moving them through the water. By the way, the wash cycle, lasting from 30 minutes to an hour, may include a pre-wash cycle, that fills the washtub with water and then agitates the machine to remove the dirt, a rest period, a rinse and then a spin to remove all the water in order to finish the washing cycle. By the way, sometimes, there may be more than one rinse and spin cycle to get clothes extra clean, and the agitator is powered by an electric motor using a rubber belt.\n\nThis is such a useful house appliance and life without it would have lost a lot of freedom from it because we would need to reschedule the daily priorities of our life activities.\n\nAnyway, this household machine is important to me because, I would have to waste a lot of time washing all the clothes by myself, which would be simply inconvenient. Besides, with my washing machine, I can actually manage my time more efficiently by doing other things simultaneously while it keeps washing my clothes. Finally, it offers great peace of mind, knowing that I can get my laundry done at any time or any emergency."

    "Answer": "Lots of household appliances are really useful to have, but today I’m going to tell you about the most useful appliance I have in my home. I’ll tell you what it is, how it works, and how life would be without it, and why it is so important to me.\n\nI didn’t have to think very long about which appliance to choose to talk about this topic, for me it is easy. I picked the item I just could not live without.  What is it? It’s a kettle. How does it work? Well, I fill it with water from my tap – and I’m lucky, where I live in Yorkshire we have lovely soft water that boils quickly and tastes great – then I simply replace the kettle on its base, flick a switch and wait for the kettle to boil. There is an element within the kettle that gets hot from the electricity, and that’s what heats the water, I don’t really know how to explain it any more fully… We have a saying in our country ‘a watched kettle never boils’ I think that’s true! The more you impatiently watch a kettle waiting for it to come to the boil the longer it seems to take.\n\nThe principle of a kettle is very simple, and it’s something that is easy to take for granted, but life without a kettle for me is unthinkable. I can think of three main reasons and all are important to me!  \n\nFirstly, I have to start my day with a cup of strong tea, I can’t do anything or speak to anyone until I’ve had that first cuppa of the day. I like Yorkshire tea, made in a pot and served with unsweetened soya milk which I always put in first. I like the pot to stand for a bit before I pour, and the tea has to be made with water that has literally just boiled or it really doesn’t taste the same. I also ideally like to have my tea in my favourite mug – never a cup.  So without a kettle, I just couldn’t face my day!\n\nThe second reason is that, in my country, if anyone ever visits your house, whether that is a friend or a tradesperson come to do a job for you, the first thing you do to be polite and welcoming is offer a drink of either tea or coffee.  Without a kettle to hand that little ritual would be impossible, it would feel so wrong.\n\nThirdly, and possibly most importantly of all, there is nothing as bonding as sitting down with a hot cup of tea with a  friend and talking to put the world to rights. Biscuits welcome too, but tea will suffice. It is my firm belief that no problem is so great it cannot be resolved with – or at least diminished by -- a shared pot of tea.\n\nIf you think I am placing too much importance on a kettle you are wrong! I don’t have to imagine life without a kettle, as unfortunately, I have experienced it. One day I went to put my kettle on and it immediately fused, it wouldn’t work!  Even though it was early in the morning it was unthinkable to go to my job without having had my cup of tea first. Before I did anything else, I hauled some trousers and a top on over my pyjamas and headed to a 24-hour supermarket so I could buy a cheap kettle, return home and have my cup of tea as usual before my shower and dressing for work. That might sound extreme, but for me, it was the only sensible practical option. When we have an occasional power cut in the UK, it’s horrendous. I can manage without electric light or hot water, but no kettle? That’s really challenging!\n\nA kettle is a much-overlooked household appliance, but in my experience, it is the most important one. Tea starts the day, shows hospitality, and in my culture, it is the one sure-fire way to make everything better. A sit-down and a cup of tea (or coffee) with a close friend is one of the best stress-busters in the world, and without a kettle, it would be much much harder to deliver on-demand!"

    "Answer": "I consider the refrigerator to be the most useful household appliance I have. Among these household appliances, I would put the refrigerator ahead because of its usefulness, specifically for me. I live in an apartment and mostly maintain all of my tasks by myself. I can't think of living without the refrigerator I do have.\n\nI own a refrigerator manufactured by LG and it is a side-by-side refrigerator with an icemaker. I put most of the foods, water and cooked food there. It makes my life easier and helps me eat fresh foods. It is quite tough for me to cook 2-3 times a day and the refrigerator saves me from doing so. My refrigerator consists of a thermally insulated compartment and the heat pump that transfers the heat created inside to the external environment. As a result, the inside of the refrigerator remains cool to a temperature below the room temperature. There is a temperature controller that the user can use to maintain the desired temperature. This temperature can differ based on the room temperature and the type of food preserved. The refrigerator also reduces the rate of spoilage of foods and foods item by maintaining a lower temperature which helps keep lower the reproduction of bacteria to a minimal level.\n\nWithout the refrigerator, life would have been much difficult. I would have to go shopping every now and then and buy only a minimum amount of fruits, vegetables and other food items that I would be able to eat in a day.\n\nI would have to purchase cold water in the summer season and have to cook 3 times a day. That would have killed a significant amount of time and would not allow me to do other stuff that I currently do. Making ice cream, smoothie and other juices would have been quite impossible and my lifestyle would not permit me to eat fresh fruits and foods. Sometimes I bring foods, meats and vegetables from my hometown and preserve them for more than a month. That would have been impossible without the refrigerator I own. For all these reasons, the refrigerator has become an important appliance for my daily life."

    "Answer": "Not sure about others, but I like to enjoy a picnic with my friends and co-workers, and I must say that I have always been lucky to arrange a nice picnic spot for us whenever having a picnic. Today, I would like to talk about one such picnic spot that I visited about a few years ago and liked.\n\nThe picnic spot, I am talking about, was located at a natural park with a lake on both sides. Of course, it was not really very close to where I lived back then as I needed to drive about an hour to arrive there. But, it was worth the drive as it was a very beautiful location with lots of trees around.\n\nIt was a rather large area with several picnic spots scattered all over the place. It was essentially two picnic sites on both sides of the lake which was connected by a very old but strongly built wooden bridge.  Anyway, people of all ages, professions and backgrounds would visit this beautiful area, mainly because it offered peace and serenity like no other places around. The chirping of birds, watching the crystal clear lake from above the wooden bridge, and the sound of gentle breeze from the trees were just too perfect of an incentive to encourage people to visit this place in order to escape from the hustling bustling of city life.\n\nHowever, some of the most attractive things about this picnic spot were that it looked very well maintained, and all its facilities there, like playgrounds and cafes, maintained safe distances among them so that people there wouldn’t get bothered by the noise made by them.\n\nAnyway, this place influences people in a very positive way as it allows them to enjoy their time in a very peaceful and quiet environment. This picnic spot offers a very distinct advantage to all of its visitors as it is large enough to accommodate plenty of visitors but also small enough to watch each other enjoying the little things, like giggling of children or fighting rabbits, of life without any hurry."

    "Answer": "Picnics are a great way to get outside and socialise with friends. I’m lucky because there are lots of good places near me where people can relax, play, chat and have a picnic if they wish. I can think of one favourite place. I’ll tell you where it is and what it’s like and try and make you understand why it is so appealing to me and lots of other visitors too. I actually think the place has quite an important role in our local community, and maybe you will understand why after my little talk.\n\nThe place is Endcliffe Park in Sheffield. It is a city park, by which I mean it is close to urban areas, surrounded by residential streets and local shops. However, the park itself is lovely. It is quite big, about 37 acres, big enough to have streams running through it, patches of woodland, a duck pond, mown areas where people can play ball games and plenty of benches where you can sit and watch the world go by. It’s well maintained by the local council and has other facilities – including loos and a very nice independent café. In the summer months, there is often an ice-cream van parked up, and at weekends and bank holidays a local guy puts up a bouncy castle and a miniature children’s carousel for children to play on. There is a small playground with swings and climbing frames, and recently, the council even incorporated a new parkour area. This is a special structure of climbing frames and walls where people can practise the sport of free-running in urban areas. It is incredible to watch.\n\nI love this park because it is really well used. I’m a great one for people watching. You can head down there with a sandwich, find yourself a bench and sit and watch the world go by. There are always families out feeding the ducks; children on their bikes or scooters; joggers sprinting by; dog-walkers. Sometimes you will see a school party pond-dipping or bravely crossing one of the sets of stepping stones. Often photographers will set up elaborate tripods there to try and get photos of the wildlife – there are lots of squirrels and birds, including a dramatic heron (a large stork-like a bird) which fishes in the pond, or the colourful tiny kingfishers that favour the running water of the streams. Local fitness instructors run outdoor boot-camps there, so you will see puffing people doing press-ups and looking like they’ve rather regretted signing up for their exercise class that morning! I think you can see why I like it so much and appreciate all the many attractions that are there for visitors of all ages and backgrounds to enjoy.\n\nIn terms of how the spot influences people, I think it just really brings the community together. Everyone who lives locally uses it. If ever I go out for a walk there, as I do quite often, I will always bump into someone I know. People use the café as a base for setting up community campaigns – like saving local trees or fundraising for charities. It is also a great location for many local events, particularly running ones. Endcliffe Park hosts my local Parkrun (a 5km weekly jog each Saturday morning) as well as being the start of lots of off-road running races that are held throughout the year. Because it is a big open space, it even hosts funfairs, music festivals and circuses – I don’t really like circuses, to be honest, but it illustrates the point of how well-used space is as a venue.  On a daily basis, people use the park as a short cut to get to work in the city. It is great to be able to appreciate the trees and changing seasons on a walk to go to the shops or get to the office. This park is one of many that fall within the city boundaries. It is one of the reasons that Sheffield is known as the greenest city in the UK. You should come and visit and find out for yourself.\n\nThere are other more remote places you can go to enjoy the countryside and be alone in the heather and the hills. Those are beautiful destinations too. But for me, my local park is just brilliant, it’s practically on my doorstep and a window on the world. I am so lucky to have this picnic and recreation spot nearby, I try never to take it for granted, but always take the time to really look at what surrounds me when I pass through."

    "Answer": "I come from Kuala Lumpur and one of the great picnic spots or recreational places there is Taman Lembah Kiara. This place is located in Taman Tun Dr Islamia in Kuala Lumpur. This is a very popular recreational place spot for nearby residents and sometimes tourists come to visit the place as well.\n\nIn the morning the Joggers come to start their day with the exercises in the fresh air. This is a place with scenic beauty, fresh air, comfortable weather and everybody loves the well-paved walking path. The park also offers a shady place for picnic lovers under the shade and they can stay there for long and enjoy their picnic. You can see that the forest animals like monkey roam there freely and some birds will attract your attention.\n\nPeople mostly like this place for scenic beauty and comfortable weather. You will have plenty of opportunities to enjoy a relaxed time there. The morning joggers are mainly the regular goers there but the nearby residents walk in the evening as well. This is a great place to relax and for recreation.\n\nThis is different than the busy metro life and people can enjoy the beautiful green surroundings without interruption and disturbance."

    "Answer": "I like to listen to all kinds of songs, whether they are taken from some solo albums or some famous music bands. Talking about music bands, of course, they usually have a different kind of appeal to music lovers, especially, if they are some musical bands like “Air Supply”.\n\nBy the way, \"Air Supply\" also happens to be my favourite music band. I first heard their songs about 15 years ago, when I still was a college student, and since then I am hooked to their music.\n\nThis famous music band is a soft rock duo, consisting of English singer-songwriter and guitarist Graham Russell and Australian lead vocalist Russell Hitchcock. Since starting their journey, Air Supply has had a succession of hits worldwide, including eight top-ten hits in the United States, in the early 1980s.  Formed in Australia in 1975, this music band has included various accompanying musicians and singers to make some of the best music in the history of soft rock.  \n\nFrom the very beginning as a soft rock duo, Air Supply has been popular for their love songs, and people react to these love songs very strongly and passionately because of their romantic nature and mellow sound.  Anyway, just like everybody else, I also love their acoustic music. In fact, these days, it seems to me that everyone is making acoustic versions of their old songs in order to make songs sound even better, but I don’t really think their “remakes” sound as good as the original songs, sung by Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.\n\nAnyway, Air Supply is my favourite band, primarily because their songs are light, and their lyrics are rather easy-going.  Besides, I have heard very few voices as beautiful and melodious as that of Russell Hitchcock.  In fact, I would consider their songs as something I can hum to anytime and anywhere. However, the best thing, which makes \"Air Supply\" my favourite music band, is that when I listen to their songs, it makes me feel as if it's just me in the room with them, and they are singing only for me."

    "Answer": "There are many music bands that I like very much but Pink Floyd is my most favourite music band. This music band is a famous music band for their music which falls under the genre progressive rock, psychedelic rock and art-rock. Though the band is not active anymore yet they are heard by millions of music lovers. They are basically English rock band that was founded in 1965 and remained active till 1995 and reunited in 2005. I have become a big fan of this band mostly because of their distinguished philosophical lyrics, sonic experiment and mind-blowing music quality.\n\nPink Floyd is considered to be one of the most musically influential and commercially successful bands of all time. Their albums have been sold well over 250 million records worldwide. Regarding the question of how people react to their music; it depends on the listener and their choice of music but people good music choice and quality lyrics choice are bound to love the songs of this band. Each of their albums got a high appraisal from the music critic and their album \"The Wall\" is widely known all over the world.  \n\nI have first listened to their music (most probably, songs from the album 'Atom hearted mother') when I was in my 10th grade in school and after that, I have listened to almost all of their songs countless times.\n\nThere are many reasons we should listen to music. It is considered to be the food of the soul. Music is refreshing and washes away the tiredness, boredom and monotonousness. Good lyrics help us brainstorm, understand things more deeply and from different perspectives, and help grow positive inspiration and motivation. Music inspires us deeply and eliminates our boredom and narrowness in life. It is one of the best entertainments and inspirational sources for human beings."

    "Answer": "In Bangladesh, there are six seasons, each containing a period of two months of intensive period. While all the seasons in my country carry their distinct “flavours” and characteristics, \"spring\" undoubtedly is my most favourite season.\n\nSpring runs from mid-February to mid-April in my country.  This season is liked by all since there is no piercing heat or bone-chilling cold in this season or is there any rain at this time. It is the best season.\n\nDuring this season, \"nature\" in my country flourishes as if it is wearing a green dress. The plants and flower trees in the fields are decorated with all kinds of beautiful flowers of all colours, offering all of them a new lease of fresh life.  Besides, people in my think that this spring season is the period of abundance since the farmers finally get ready to harvest their crops and enjoy the fruits of their labour. Of course, the poets also get busy with writing their poems during this season. The poor are happy to have it as a relief from severe cold. Then, during this season, the sky remains cloudless. Flowers bloom everywhere, with their sweet smell spreading in all directions, and bees fly from one flower to another in order to pollinate. A breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard, as well as the melodious voice of cuckoos in order to please our ear.\n\nAnyway, this is my favourite season because I can actually do a lot of things and outdoor activities, including cycling, enjoying a picnic or travelling to a beautiful natural site, during this period. Besides, I also like to hang out with my friends late at night in order to enjoy the beautiful and clear night sky. The beauty of spring season makes forget about our sorrows and also allows us to enjoy the nature around us to the fullest.  Finally, it is my favourite season also because it allows me to enjoy the perfect temperature, which is neither too hot nor too cold, no matter I stay inside my house of enjoying some outdoor activities."

    "Answer": "I come from the \"United Kingdom\" where talking about the weather is always a topic of conversation. That is because we have four different seasons, and each is special and beautiful in its own way. Each different time of year also has its own distinct weather. Today I’m going to tell you about my favourite season, when it is, why I like it and what changes it brings, as well as the things I like to do in this season.\n\nSo in the UK, our four seasons are spring, summer, autumn and winter. I like all of them in a way, but if I must choose, then I think my favourite must be autumn. Autumn is usually between around September and November each year, though it can shift a little if we have a long hot summer.\n\nFactually, autumn is the time of year when the days start to get shorter again, the temperature cools and plants and trees start to shut down and prepare for winter. You might think this would be depressing, but I don’t think so. For me, autumn is something of a relief. I get terrible hay fever in the summer from pollen, and I’m not great in the heat, so I find the temperature much more comfortable in autumn and I can be a lot more active and do more things. The best thing about autumn is the way that the trees change colour. I’m lucky because I live near woodlands. As autumn begins the leaves on trees transform from green to rich oranges; vivid yellows; warm browns and blinding gold.  If you have never seen a forest in autumn, it’s quite hard to imagine, but really and truly, at this time of year, if the autumn sun catches leaves as they blow off in the wind they can look like flames or pure gold. It is astonishingly beautiful.\n\nI also like to be outside, in summer, everyone else has the same idea, but in the autumn there are still some mild days to be enjoyed and I like to wrap up warm and head off for long walks in the blustering wind and have the countryside all to myself. I like to look out for wildlife and interesting plants on my treks. Sometimes I’ll go walking or running with a friend and it feels like the whole place up on the hills belongs just to us.\n\nSo for me, autumn is special because of its beautiful colours; the lack of pollen to give me hay fever, the possibility of long country walks and being able to enjoy our wonderful British countryside all to myself!\n\nEventually autumn ends, and it becomes very dark and cold as we move into winter. I’m not so keen on that as there is very little daylight and it seems to go on forever.  On the other hand, we have some great winter festivals: Halloween; Bonfire night and of course Christmas, so every season has its good points in my view!"

The weather condition in our country is the best during the fall and you won't feel the excessive heat of the summer or the cold wind of the winter. Nature arranges itself with the beautiful green and flowers are noticed all around the places.\n\nI like the scenic beauty, charming weather, festivities and freshness of this season. This is a distinctive season and is known as the queen of seasons in our country. The newly grown green leaves of trees, the colourful flowers, the chirping of the birds and crisp and mild air of fall are some of the noticeable changes in our country. After the hot summer ends, the fall comes and people in our country love this season.\n\nFall is the season that marks the transition from summer into winter and the night falls later than winter. The farmers start harvesting seeds in this season and they become quite active during this season.\n\nI usually get a vacation at the beginning of the fall and visit my hometown. This is a perfect vacation for me as my hometown becomes even more beautiful. Because of geographical location and culture, we have 2-3 major festival during this time and people enjoys the festivals and weathers."

    "Answer": "Well, this is a rather tough topic for me because I have visited several shopping malls, that I like, and it is not really easy to pinpoint one of them as my favourite. But, I would still go ahead and pick one of them as my most favourite to keep our discussion interesting.\n\nThe shopping mall, I want to talk about, is called “Eastern Plaza” which is conveniently located several kilometres away from where I live in my city. Considering how people from all directions can arrive at the mall rather easily, I would say that the mall is located at a perfection location.  Having served the residents of my city for more over 20 years, Eastern plaza mall easily is one of the largest and busiest shopping destinations of my country which has 6 floors and an area of almost 400,000 square feet.\n\nHaving a very beautiful and contemporary architectural design, this mall is home to almost 300 stores which include some of the world’s top-class collection of designer labels and luxury brands. I like to visit this shopping mall as often as I can in order to buy my clothes, shoes and perfumes, but I just can’t make it more than once a month because of my busy schedule.  \n\nBut, no matter when I visit this shopping mall, I see that all kinds of people from all age groups, professions and backgrounds are visiting this place. I have even noticed that many people from other cities, far, far away from the city in which the mall is located, come to do shopping at this mall.  \n\nAnyway, it is my favourite shopping mall, mainly because it is close to where I live, and it takes about only 15 minutes to drive there. I also like visiting the mall because it has a rather huge selection of products for all ages and sizes, making it almost impossible for a shopper to leave the place without buying what he or she really needs. Finally, it is my favourite mall also because it looks very organized, and the prices there are very reasonable."

It is best known as the Diamond Plaza and is situated at 34 Le Duan Street, near the Notre Dame Cathedral. I visit this shopping mall almost twice in a month and sometimes more frequent than that.\n\nPeople from nearby places and from the city are the most frequent visitors but it's not uncommon that tourists and shoppers from other cities come and shop from this shopping mall. This shopping centre includes a 22 story building plus an adjacent 15 story building and offers a great shopping experience including restaurants, cafe, hospital, lounges, Cinema Theater. There is a helicopter pad on the roof of this shopping mall and offers many other facilities.\n\nThe Diamond Plaza shopping mall hosts many renowned brands and offers a distinctive shopping experience. You can find almost everything you need to shop from here. Many fashion fans find it as their prime place for shopping and the shopping environment is unmatched. One does not need to be rich to come and shop here as the goods offered suits the people from economic status.\n\nThe food court is something you would love about this shopping mall. There are more than hundreds of food shops that you can pick from and the gaming zone attracts mostly the game lovers and teenagers. The movie theatre of the Diamond Plaza is called Lotte Cinema and is on the 13th floor. With the most modern facility and the safe environment, this is an ideal shopping centre for all types of shoppers.\n\nI like this shopping mall mostly because of the quality products and good price offering. Apart from that the security, customer service and nice environment also attract me. Another reason that affects my shopping decision from this shopping mall is its distance from my living place. It takes only 15 minutes to reach there and this is one of the reasons I mostly decide to shop there."

We also happen to be a country of many festivals, which are enjoyed by all Australians, regardless of their race, religions and cultures, and this cue card topic offers me a great opportunity to talk about one such festival of my country.\n\nThe name of this festival is called the “National Folk Festival”. It is an Australian family-oriented celebration which is attended by a significant number of people from all over Australia. Being held in Melbourne for the first time in 1967, it has been taking place at Exhibition Park in Canberra (EPIC) every Easter from Easter Thursday - Easter Monday, every year. It was inspired by the Newport Folk Festival in the United States, apparently in an effort to recognize the folk culture of Australian people, so that the people in my great country can gain valuable insight about their cultural identity through grassroots and community activities.\n\nThis also seems to be a festival which is renowned among players of traditional music as a place to go and meet their friends, and to see some excellent performances, and attend some workshops or training sessions with some of the best musicians in this half of the world. Anyway, people celebrate this festival by organising concerts, a film festival, numerous impromptu street performances, workshops on making, playing and repairing musical instruments, visual art, storytelling and poetry, and many dance workshops. There are also many craft stalls in this festival site to introduce people to Australian handicraft works.\n\nAnyway, this is an important festival in my country, because it allows regular Australian folks like us to understand and appreciate our cultural identity and features so that we can bring the much-needed sense of unity and solidarity among our people – people who come from different races, religions, cultures and backgrounds from all over the world.  Besides, this festival also allows us to have some fun and good time together with our friends and family while also learning about our folk culture at the same time."

    "Answer": "China is a country of numerous festivals and we love to celebrate different occasions whole-heartedly. In fact, there are so many festivals in China and it is quite tough for me to pick a particular favourite. I would love to talk about the Spring Festival, which is also known as Chinese New Year, as I personally enjoy it quite a lot. Other prominent festivals like National Day, Yung Xiao Festival, Lantern Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival etc are also widely celebrated in our country.\n\nThe Spring Festival is the biggest festival in our country and this festival touches every single street and every single citizen of China. I suppose it is somewhat like the Christmas festival is in Western countries in terms of celebration and as the New Year festival in terms of its norm. If someone visits our country during the Spring Festival, he will surely notice the colourful and distinguishable look at the houses and streets have. This is the time for families to gather together and enjoy their time. People get together with their family members during this time and they seem happy for that. Many stores and businesses remain closed during this time and people cook delicious food, visit relatives & friends, watch TV, gossip together, wear new dresses and welcome New Year. Many traditional food items are cooked during this time and the aroma of delicious foods could be easily found during this time.  \n\nVisiting relatives and friends is a custom I really like about this festival. This is a festival that remains for several days and personally, I find it very enjoyable as I get together with my family. I also contact some of my friends and enjoy our time together. I invite them to have dinner with us and I often roam around the streets with them. Welcoming the New Year is another important aspect of this festival. We wish each other a happy and prosperous new year and exchange gifts with friends and family members."

This usually occurs on 14th or 15th April and celebrated among the Bengali people, minor Bengali communities and in some states of India. The famous Mughal Emperor Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar introduced the Bengali Calendar most probably because of easier tax collection of that time.\n\nThis is possibly the most widely celebrated festival in our country. People from all social-economic states, from all ages and all religions, celebrate with great joy, festivity and happiness. The rally, the song, the traditional dresses, the traditional foods, the boat racing, cock-fight, pigeon racing and many more activities are very common in this festival.\n\nThe people celebrate this festival the whole day starting from the early morning. Men, women and children all wear traditional dresses, draws some temporary arts and tattoos, go to the central University place and enjoys the festival greatly.\n\nThe whole capital city, as well as other places of the country, warmly welcome the New Year and as a long tradition cook delicious dishes. This is a festival which is rooted in our history. Usually, people get their harvest at that time and makes different delicious foods. After emperor Akbar introduced this Bengali New Year, we are celebrating with great enthusiasm and in a distinctive way.\n\nNo other festival depicts the true traditions and cultures as does the Pohela Boishak."

However, there was one city which, I think, should be specifically mentioned here because I was not too sure about visiting it until the last moment. In fact, I heard a lot of negative comments about this particular city before visiting it about a year ago, but I was proved wrong when I actually visited it.\n\nThe name of this city is “Milan”. I think that we all know where the city of Milan is. But, still, just to refresh our memory a little about this city, it is one of Italy’s major metropolis cities in its northern Lombardy region.\n\nMilan is also a major financial hub which is known for its high-end shops and restaurants. And, of course, it is known as the capital of the fashion world also. Anyway, I visited this city recently, about a few months ago.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Milan has a lot of wonderful and modern architectures for a city which was bombed rather heavily during the Second World War.  Besides, visiting Lake Como, which was only an hour (by train) from Milan, was one of my best experiences ever. In fact, Lake Como, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful places on earth with its mountains and colourful villas.\n\nMilan has also some of the most beautiful and green public parks in the world, in my opinion. One of my favourite green spaces in Milan was the Library of Trees, which contains more than 100 species of trees. However, there is one thing that I didn’t like about Milan was that it was rather expensive.\n\nAnyway, all in all, I would say that visiting Milan was a great experience. Even though it is a bustling city with a lot of activities, I think that there is a lot of life in it and people in its different neighbourhoods tend to enjoy their life to the fullest. I think that I would go back to visit that city again in future."

This city is situated on the bank of the Tasman Sea and has around 4.6 million people. I have visited this city in 2008 after I finished my graduation and loved my stay there. Sydney had many attractive natural areas, botanic gardens, parks, and high rising buildings. This city has many heritage-listed buildings that attract tourists and visitors. The Sydney Opera House is one of the most recognised landmarks in Australia and is a great place to visit.\n\nThis city is known for the dynamic cultural hub and it has many famous museums, galleries and art galleries as well. Because of the great architecture, warm weather and hundreds of tourists attraction more than 11 million international and domestic tourists visit this city each year. I had been there for about 15 days and I really enjoyed everything about this city. I stayed at a 20 storied hotel that offered a really amusing view. The transportation system of the city is better than many other cities and I could have been maintaining the track and time of my schedule because of that. I loved being at open & wide spaces in the gardens and parks. People are welcoming and friendly there. A tourist can get necessary help both from people and the authority and can roam easily without any interruption. I saw 2/3 art museum and some cultural festivals and those were awesome.\n\nThere are so many places to be, so many things to do in Sydney. Some of the attractive places are Royal Botanic Garden, Hyde Park, Queen Victoria Building, Sydney Townhall, Macquarie Lighthouse, Australia Square, Sydney Opera House and so on.\n\nI had a tremendous vacation in Sydney and I liked most of the places there and I enjoyed so much that I did not even notice how quickly the 2 weeks scheduled time has passed."

    "Answer": "I have been lucky enough to have several great teachers when growing up as a student, and I remember all of their contributions in helping me become the person I am today. However, I would like to specifically mention about one teacher here today whom I remember a bit more than others.\n\nIt was about 14 years ago, and I was about a 13 years old high school student – a high school student who hated math. In fact, I found math to be so difficult that I sometimes even pretended to be sick to my parents in order to skip the class. Of course, I had tried all my best to perform better in this difficult subject, but I could get was just a passing score in the test.\n\nBut, all that changed when Mr Rajon Seikh had joined our high school as a math teacher. By the way, he didn’t look like a very smart person to me to become a math teacher, even though he was quite qualified.  Anyway, Mr Rajon gave us a brief lecture to us about the math lesson, and I must say that I was pretty amazed at his level of confidence. In fact, he assured us that if we all paid attention to his class for only about 30 minutes every day for about 6 months, he would make us the math experts. He also told us that he didn’t come to teach us, but rather he had come to create a mindset in us to learn mathematics easily and quickly.  \n\nSo, his lessons started, and to my pleasant surprise, math suddenly started to make sense to me. In fact, I grew so confident in the next 6 months, I felt like I could actually get a top score in math.\n\nAnyway, I remember this teacher because he had all the tricks in his armoury of math teaching in order to arouse interest in the minds of his students quickly. Besides, it was him, who had given me the confidence to do better not only in math but also in other classes."

    "Answer": "Throughout my academic life, I found and came into contact with several teachers whom I'll never forget mostly because of their personality and quality teaching. Such a teacher who I remember clearly was Mr Aurther who taught us History at our 8th grade.\n\nI was then about 13-14 years old and was in class Eight. He had an admiring personality and a different way of teaching. He was very punctual and honest and inspired us to be so. He never pressurised us on studying and always told us stories about different historical events. In his classes, we never felt bored. He had a gift of making the lessons interesting and attracting students to his stories. Much of the history I now know is because of him. \n\nMy major was Science and I have not studied history that much but whatever interest I grew on history was mostly his contribution. I can still recall the stories I heard from him. He never misbehaved with any of his students and all of his students admired him very much. I learned later on that he was an honest and benevolent man in his personal life. I still remember him because he was a good man, a wise mentor and a nice person who taught us things that we still remember."

    "Answer": "I like to go to many different places depending on my mood. Today, however, I’m going to tell you about a special place near to where I live. I will explain where it is and how I get there. I will try and describe what it looks like and explain why I like the location so much.\n\nI am lucky, although I live in a city, from my house I can walk to the edges of the Peak District, which is a beautiful national park just a few miles from the city centre. To get to the national park I have to walk from my house down some local roads, and up a steep hill past some allotments. After about a mile or so striding out away from the urban areas, I get to a lovely bit of woodland which has a public footpath you can follow onwards and upwards. It can be a bit of a scramble towards the end of the path as it is very steep indeed, but eventually, you leave the woodland and are on the edge of open farmland. Another footpath crosses some sheep-filled fields, and finally, you are on the moors of the Peak District. It is really spectacular.\n\nThe Peak District can be a really wild place, with its vast expanses of open moorland. You are high up, and it is quite exposed so it can be very windy and cold even in the summer. There are rocky outcrops and strange configurations of stones that have been weathered by centuries of wind and rain to create dramatic shapes. Some boulders are in piles, and there are steep vertical cliffs too. The area attracts lots of people who like walking, climbing and bouldering because of its unique and beautiful landscape. Everywhere is dark wet peat underfoot and lots of heathers. This is a low growing plant that flowers at the end of the summer turning the whole landscape purple. The park covers a huge area, I think around 555 square miles, so the terrain differs from area to area, of course, I am biased, but I believe I live near the most remarkably beautiful part.\n\nI love this place because if ever I am feeling down, or a bit enclosed, in just an hours walk I can find myself in a deserted but picturesque place, where the elements are more extreme. In winter rain and wind can batter you, but in summer the sky seems to go on forever. Every day is different up there, and every hour of every day too. The area is so huge, that often you can have it all to yourself, of course, there are other walkers about, but you can quickly disappear in the vastness of the space. The people who live in Sheffield, like me, are very proud that we are so near to the Peak District National Park, and it is no surprise it became the United Kingdom's first national park on 17 April 1951. A birthday that should be celebrated I think!"

    "Answer": "I am not really a very outgoing person. Therefore, I don’t exactly like to go to many places, unless I have a very valid reason to do so, especially, if I have to travel to a distant place. However, one distant place, which I really like to visit often, is my grandparent’s house.\n\nNow, I don’t really know many people who dislike going to their grandparent’s house, but I think that I like it a bit more than most others because I grew up there. As I have just mentioned, my grandparent’s house is a long-distance trip from where I live. In fact, I need to travel about 12/14 hours by train, but a bit longer if I travel by bus. But, whether I travel by bus or train, the excitement is the same, especially, as soon as, I leave the city vicinity, in which, I live.\n\nAnyway, my grandparents live in beautiful countryside which is not even remotely as crowded as the city, in which, I live. Like many other countrysides, it also has many beautiful trees and a number of big green valleys. The place also has a lot of fertile farmlands where the farmers cultivate and grow different kinds of crops throughout the year. If anyone roams around my grandparent’s place, he or she will get to see some beautiful ponds and lakes, from which, water is being channelled through the drain in order to irrigate the farmlands around them. By the way, there aren’t many paved streets at my grandparent’s place, but it is modern enough to have many shops and retail stores in it, from where people can buy different kinds of things to meet their daily needs.\n\nAnyway, I like my grandparent’s place and often visit there because it is very peaceful and quiet. Besides, the natural love and compassion of my relatives there are just too good to miss. The natural beauty of this place, along with the clear view of its blue sky without getting blocked by some high rising buildings, is also something that keeps drawing me close to my grandparent’s place."

    "Answer": "I like to visit my hometown more than visiting any other place. After I finished school, I came to the capital of your country and did my graduation here. Later on, I have started my job and since then have been staying here. Whenever I get vacations, I plan to visit my hometown.\n\nTo go there, I need to purchase advance bus ticket 2-3 days prior to the departure. I mostly go there by bus. Alternatively, I can go to my hometown on a train. The bus journey takes around 4-5 hours and the train journey takes 1-2 hours more than the bus journey. After reaching our hometown station, I usually pick a shared taxi that drops me near my home.\n\nMy hometown is a small urban area which is full of beauty and wonder. Green trees, fresh air and serene environment make it an ideal place to live in. My hometown is just beside a river and has less density of population than the capital city. The houses and shopping centres are not cramped and have their own urban charms. My hometown is a special place for me as I have spent my childhood there. There are three tourist attractions are there and the place is renowned for traditional foods and customs. Roads are clean and people are educated there. Anyone who visits this place will find it attractive."

    "Answer": "I heard a lot of stories from my parents and grandparents when I was growing up as a child. Some of those stories were funny, exciting and fairy tales while the others were sad or thought-provoking. However, today I would like to share a story here, told to me by my old grandfather, which is about the sheer bravery of a person.\n\nThe story goes like this - back in the days of my grandfather in the early 1920s, they used to live in a village which was surrounded by many forests. However, having forests around the village of my grandparents was not exactly an issue for them if some tigers also hadn’t lived in those forests and preyed on their cattle and goats at will. But, unfortunately, none of the villagers, where my grandparents had lived, was brave enough to take the challenge to kill their forest enemies. So, they decided to seek help from one of the strongest (a bodybuilder) and bravest persons, they knew, from another village, who had the experience of killing a few tigers by using a rifle.\n\nThis mystery person came to the village of my grandfather and set up a tent at a strategic location to kill the tiger. After waiting for a couple of nights, the brave hunter finally saw a tiger in the village on the third night.  Seeing this, the tiger hunter immediately came out with his rifle and tried to pull his trigger but, unfortunately, he wasn’t able to do so in time. So, the tiger attacked him and injured him, even though it was eventually killed by the bullet from his rifle. Anyway, it was indeed an interesting story because the brave hunter actually overpowered the tiger, even though he lost one of his ears in the process.\n\nAnyway, I still remember this story because it actually gave me a live image of the difficult life that people lived a century ago when they had to constantly struggle with nature to survive. Besides, it also taught me to be strong and brave if I really needed to face any challenge in my life."

    "Answer": "Childhood stories were fascinating and in my childhood, I had been very fond of those short of stories. My grandmother used to tell me stories before going to sleep. One such childhood story that I can remember is about a prince who fought and defeated a mighty giant to rescue his princess.\n\nHe was a good prince who helped his countrymen and was a very good fighter. He was happily married to the prince he falls in love with. They were benevolent kings and queens for the country and people of the country loved them very much. One day a giant ghost came from other territory and tried to abduct a small kid. The prince was out of the country at that moment for business purpose and the queen tried to force the giant to leave. That irritated the giant and it finally abducted the queen. The prince returned to the country a few days back and learned the stories. He became very gloomy and decided to search for his queen. Everybody tried to convince him but he finally remained steady in his decision. He started a long and struggle-some journey to find the giant and rescue the queen. The journey was much surprising and full of different puzzles and obstacles. He finally reached to the abyss and found the queen. He had to fight with the giant and finally kill it to get his princess back.\n\nAs a child, this was one of my very favourite stories. My grandma told me the story multiple times and I used to insist her to tell me this very story. As a child, the story opened a new horizon to me. I believed that every word of this story was true and that's why it made a special place in my mind. Most probably I have thought a lot about the things happened in this story and as a result, I have still remembered the story."

    "Answer": "My mother used to tell me bedtime stories during my childhood and I have heard some of those stories so many times they have been permanently depicted in my memory.\n\nOne such story was the story of a boy who was 10 years old and got lost one day. The boy tried to get back home but since a bad magician used his black magic on the boy, he could not get back home. The boy would be totally lost once the magic engulfs him totally and the magician would then use the boy to do bad things. But in the boy's memory was his mother and father and that's why he was not totally lost. The boy continued his search for the way back to his home and on this journey, he met an old man, a wounded tiger, a candy man, a king and a nomad with gold coins. Each time the boy met someone many exciting things happened. In fact, those were the tests for him. If he passes those tests would be able to get back home and if he fails the tests, he would never be able to get back home. His confront with the king was most exciting as he had to go to different places and collect different things from challenging places to prove that he was innocent. Each time the boy faced a new challenge and amazing circumstances, the story gets more exciting.\n\nAfter the boy won the last challenge he was given, the impact of the magic was no longer applicable and he found that he was standing nearby his home. As a child, I really enjoyed the story. I was almost the same age the boy in the story was and every time he faced a new challenge, the story took a turn and revealed another challenge. The story was intelligently made and I loved to hear it."

    "Answer": "Talking about holidays is one of my favourite subjects because it usually carries some fun and memorable experiences. In fact, some of these fun and great experiences are still very much fresh in my memory, as I have recently celebrated an important holiday, which I want to talk about in a moment.\n\nThe holiday, I want to talk about, was one of the important national holidays of Bangladesh, celebrated in order to mark the beginning of a new Bengali calendar year, which is, of course, different from the new English or Gregorian calendar year. This time, the holiday was marked on 14th of April, and all the offices, schools, banks and other important establishments of my county remained closed on that day.\n\nThis holiday coincides with one of the major harvesting periods of my country and celebrated in order to carry forward our Bengali cultural heritage, and its pride, with a festive mood all over my country.  Anyway, the holiday is marked with singing, processions, and fairs. Traditionally, businesses start this day with a new ledger, clearing out the old one. Singers perform traditional songs welcoming the New Year. People enjoy classical “theatrical” plays and performances, and they also wear festive dresses, with women, decorating their hair with flowers especially.\n\nPeople of Bangladesh prepare and enjoy varieties of traditional festive food during this holiday which may include \"panta bhat\" (watered rice), \"ilish bhaji\" (fried Hilsa fish) and lots of special \"bhartas\" (mashed vegetables and fishes). I also enjoyed this great holiday with some of my friends by attending a fair, visiting some of my relatives, as well as by eating some traditional food items at one of my favourite restaurants of my hometown.\n\nAnyway, this holiday was important to me because it allowed me to visit some of my dear friends and relatives whom I haven’t met in a long time. Besides, it also allowed me to recover from the fatigue of a busy working life, by helping me enjoy my time in the company of my family and friends, which was well overdue."

Eid-ul-Fitr is one of the major festivals in our country, and it is an important holiday for Muslims all around the world. I celebrated it with my parents, siblings, friends and relatives in my hometown and it was one of the best holidays of my life. Each year this day is widely celebrated by the Muslims with great enthusiasm, fervour and religious norm. \n\nI had 4 days off for the occasion and I was in my hometown in those days. Before the Eid day, I did some shopping for my family members and relatives. On the Eid day, I wake up early in the morning, took a shower and went to the Mosque to say my prayer. We wore new clothes on the day and my mom cooked several delicious food items at home. We went to visit some of our neighbours and relatives in the evening and spent a great day with joy and happiness with friends and relatives.\n\nThis Eid day is very significant for Muslims and they celebrate it with great joy and religious norm. For me, this is religiously important and I can be with my family members on this occasion."

After scheduled work and several deadlines, this was a much desired and deserved holiday for me and I went to visit my hometown during those days. I asked one of my very close friends to visit my hometown and he was excited to travel with me. After we reached our hometown, I made a plan to introduce the life and custom of our hometown to my friends and we visited almost more than 5 famous places in our locality.\n\nOn the third day, we had a family and friends picnic and we had this picnic in the garden of our home. That was really enjoyable as I had been with the friends and family members I really care about. I and my friends watched some new movies on my laptop and we watched movies almost every night.\n\nThis was an important holiday because I needed a break after a series of hard work in the office. Meeting 5-6 deadlines month after month was a bit stressful for me and I was eagerly waiting for this holidays. In terms of refreshment, relief and enjoyment this was one of the best holidays ever for me."

    "Answer": "I am lucky to have several relatives, whom I happen to like because all of them have helped me become the person I am today, in one way or another. However, today, I would like to specifically mention one of them here, who is a bit more close to me than some of my other relatives.\n\nHis name is Ebad Ali, and he is a distant cousin of mine, even though I am not too sure that I should actually use the qualifying adverb “distant”, given the type of close relationship, we enjoy with each other. Anyway, Ebad is almost the same age as me, and we grew up together for a significant part of our childhood, when we did a lot of things together, from watching cartoons and children’s movies to chasing a duck into a lake. However, during our high school years, we parted away from each other because my father had to move to a different place for professional reasons.\n\nGladly, we are back again at the place because Ebad got a great job in the same city where I live. In fact, now we try to enjoy our life the same way as we used to do when we were children. Of course, now we don’t chase ducks or watch cartoons anymore like the old days. Instead, we go to a movie theatre to enjoy a great movie or hit a nearby lake in order to swim during the summer. We also go to our favourite cafe every week to enjoy some fresh coffee and snacks. Ebad and I are very close to each other – close enough to even exchange our shirts. Anyway, I like Ebad for many reasons, but his positive attitude towards life is what makes me like him the most.\n\nTo conclude, I like Ebad because there are very few people in this world, except my parents, who understands me as better as him. I like Ebad also because he is a very resourceful and happy person, and he seems to have solutions for everything."

In fact, we share so many common interests and activities that he is more like a friend to me than a guardian. I am very close to him and we share our books, thought and views on different issues like two close friends would do.\n\nI like him because of his authentic compassion, support for me and because of the common interest he shares with me. I personally find him very benevolent and talented and he is a good counsellor for me. I respect him and it surprises me the way he treats me. I have never found him to ignore me and treat me as a younger nephew ever and that’s something I really like about him.\n\nWe often discuss our family issues, our thoughts of the politics, religion, books writers, movies, music and on many other issues. We share our books and recommend books to each other. I find his taste very much similar to me and that makes us do lots of things together including travelling, watching movies, spending holidays together and many more activities someone would like to do with friends. He even spends time with my friends without any hesitation.\n\nI am the only child of my parent and from my childhood, I found that my younger uncle was living in our house. This was the main reason we became close and apart from that the shared interests, his personality and behaviour actually made us close. He took care of me in my childhood and supported me in many ways in my teenage and with time I became very close to him."

    "Answer": "I am not exactly a “pet-friendly” person, so I never really owned any pet before. But, I don’t mind other people having pets as long as they teach their pets how to behave. Today, I would like to talk about one such good pet – as in a properly trained pet dog called peddle – which used to be owned by someone, I knew a long time ago.\n\nThe pet, I am talking about, was a special kind of dog called poodle. It was a standard size white poodle, with a height of about 50 centimetres and over 20 inches at the shoulder. Not sure, how old it really was, but I saw it live in my neighbourhood for about 5 years.\n\nHowever, I would assume that the poodle wasn’t really that old because I found him to be busy and active almost always in the streets of my neighbourhood. I am not really an expert on the dog or any kind of pet, but I thought that the poodle was of a gentle breed since I had seldom heard any barking from it except on some occasions when the weather was rainy and/or windy. I also liked the fact it would never fight with other dogs or animals. In fact, if anything, it actually liked to play with other animals like cats and cattle.\n\nIt even used to play with the little birds sometimes without ever trying to harm them. By the way, this dog didn’t really need that much care except an exercise of about 40 minutes on a daily basis and some routine grooming. Besides, I don’t really think that the poodle ate that much food except some dry dog foods and some occasional rice-chicken diet.\n\nAnyway, the poodle is a popular type of pet because they are mostly good family dogs — fun, energetic, smart and easy to train. And, they would never disappoint us if we want to take some exercise outside and enjoy some outdoor activities. After all, they are very sociable and playful dogs, and they even like to play with the cats! All in all, it is a good pet to have at our home."

    "Answer": "It is a very long time since I had a pet!  However, when we were small my sister and I did both have pets, I’m going to tell you all about them.  What kind of animal, how we looked after them, why we liked them and what makes them to this day a popular children’s pet.\n\nThe animal in question was a guinea pig!  My sister and I had one each, mine was called Treacle, and her’s was called Toffee.  They were father and son, Treacle was the older guinea pig and Toffee was a bit younger.  Despite their name, guinea pigs are neither from Guinea and nor are they related to pigs.  They are rodents, with distinctive front teeth, they are quite small, compact, rounded creatures, fur-covered, with short legs and no tail.  They are also highly social, I think they come from South America, and ‘naturally’ would live in groups of up to ten individuals so it is really important they are kept with others when in captivity or they become very stressed and unhappy.  \n\nThe guinea pigs lived together in a shared hutch in the garden.  They weren’t difficult to look after, but they did need a lot of daily care.  First thing in the morning we would open the hutch and let the guinea pigs out so they could run around the garden.  They never strayed very far, and kept the lawn beautifully short, they ate grass in preference to any of the planted flowers.  Whilst they were running around we would clean out the hutch every day.  The hutch was in two parts, an enclosed sleeping area, and a larger living area with a wire mesh side.  We would take everything out in the morning and replace it with new bedding.  First a layer of sawdust and then newspaper covered by lots of soft fresh hay in the sleeping area so it was warm and cosy. Then in the living area, we would scatter a deep layer of sawdust before putting out fresh food, a mixture of vegetables – carrots and cabbage, together with a special guinea pig food we brought from the pet food shop which contained grains like crushed maize as well as grass pellets.   They also had a water bottle hanging up which we filled up freshly each day.  The guinea pigs spent all day in the garden, but as evening fell they would put themselves to bed in their hutch.  Last thing at night we would check they were safe and well, and lock them in and pull a cover down over the front of the hutch.  This kept them warm and dry even if the weather was bad and protected them in case foxes might visit at night.\n\nI loved my guinea pig.  He was a beautiful warm chestnut colour.  He had sort of rosette shapes in his coat – not like smooth-haired guinea pigs which I think are more usual today.  I liked to cuddle him, which he tolerated, but honestly, when I look back I don’t know if he really enjoyed it as much as I did. Poor Treacle.  He and his brother Toffee were very talkative.  They made a delightful squeaking and chattering noise when they were excited – for example when they could hear you were on your way over to feed them.\n\nGuinea pigs are really good pets I think.  They are gentle and not too difficult to look after.  However, it’s really important they have the companionship of the same species, a proper diet, fresh food and water every day and lots of room to move about.  They are incredibly active, running around for about 20 hours each day.  Having a pet is a big responsibility, but I think I learned a lot from looking after our guinea pigs.  You have to care for them every day, and that is an important lesson for a child to learn. Sadly, in time they grew old and died.  We were very upset, but that was perhaps a useful life lesson too.  I gained a lot from my friendship with Treacle, but even so, I worry about animals being kept as pets, they are not all looked after as well as they should be.  If children are given pets, I think it’s really important they know how to care for them properly and that an adult is around to supervise, then everyone can be satisfied that the animal is safe and well and that the children and pets are both as happy as each other!"

    "Answer": "My uncle had a dog almost 10 years ago and we called it Dave. We stayed at our uncle's house for about 6 months at that time and I often played with Dave. This dog was around 2 years old and very fond of us. We used to feed him and that's why he became so close to us.\n\nMy uncle placed it at a pet training centre when it was 1 year old. So he was a dog who needed a little care. We used to bath him 3-4 times a week. He was very choosy about his sleeping place and we needed to make him a cosy dog room. When he became sick, we needed to take him to the nearest pet hospital. We used to tie him with a belt him sometimes when we took him to unknown places. Mostly keeping him clean and dry was the care he needed most.\n\nI liked the pet very much mostly because of the way he treated us. Whenever I returned home he came to me and acted so fondly. It seemed like he understood my moods and gestures and acted accordingly. I liked the pet because he was a good accompany."

In fact, I was working too much, so as soon as I asked for some vacation time for a holiday trip for my whole family, my company gladly agreed. Immediately, the next day, my whole family, including my parents, my young wife and a couple of my siblings were well on our way to one of the stunningly beautiful port cities of my country.\n\nOf course, before deciding about our destination, we argued long among ourselves as to what were some of the best spots to choose for our trip. Some argued that we would travel to a tourist spot of a neighbouring country of ours because the weather there was perfect at that time of the year. Some others argued that we would travel to Europe. But, in the end, we agreed to the proposal of my loving mother who suggested that we would travel to a major port city in my country because it was so naturally beautiful.\n\nIn fact, my mother told us that she had long held a dream in her heart to witness how all those foreign and beautiful looking ships, full of many different kinds of people and cargos, from different parts of the world, were docking at our port. But, as for the remaining members of my family, we went there mainly to enjoy the beautiful mountain site, with plenty of trees underneath of it, and swimming in the warm water of our ocean. Then, of course, we also wanted to enjoy the barbeque of some freshly-caught sea fishes.\n\nAnyway, it was a nice family trip because we all did some fun things, which included swimming in the ocean, enjoying a speed boat ride, taking a family picture of ours at the feet of the rather large mountain site along with many other beautiful pictures at different interesting parts of the city. We also didn’t forget to purchase some beautiful boutiques to carry with us to home as some souvenir."

This trip was arranged by our office and all of our colleagues and some of their relatives went there.\n\nAs it was an official tour and I had been thinking about going to such a trip, I agreed to go. The place was a good picnic spot and historically important. I have had plans to visit the place and when I heard that an official tour has been arranged there, I simply agreed to go on the trip without giving any second thought.\n\nOn the trip day, all of the participants met at our office ground and took our seats on the bus. It was about 3-4 hours journey and at 11:30 am. we reached the spot. We visited the small museum there, took bath in a pond, ran through the narrow roads and bridged, climbed at small hills, played cricket, took photos, took our meals, arranged a singing competition, raffle draw program and many more interesting things there. We saw historical significances and a documentary on a wide-screen projector arranged by the governing authority of the place, we visited a small museum, and we saw beautiful fishes in the rivers, birds on the trees and many eye-catching sceneries there.\n\nWe stayed there the whole day and returned home after the evening. That was a good trip that I really enjoyed."

    "Answer": "I try not to be a very picky person when it comes to choosing or buying a product. But, that may not always be a wise thing to do because it leaves us enough room for dissatisfaction just like it did for me when I bought a product last month.\n\nIt was a travel bag which I bought from one of the popular and prestigious shopping centres in my city. I could have bought that travel bag from some other stores, but since one of my cousins convinced me to visit that shopping centre, because it was selling some beautiful travel bags on discount, I decided to oblige.\n\nI must say that I never really visited that super centre because I was under the impression that they didn’t have a collection of enough quality products. But, after visiting that shopping centre, I was proved out to be wrong because they did sell a lot of products, including some top-class travel bags. And, they were being sold on some discounted price also.\n\nNaturally, I felt happy and picked up a travel bag for me which looked just too perfect for me at that time. Of course, I had to pay a hefty price for it even though the product was sold on a discount. By the way, the bag was supposed to be water-proof. But, after taking it home, after a few weeks, I found out that it was not waterproof when I accidentally spilt some cold coffee on it. On top of that, I also noticed that the metallic chain looked already loose after using it only for a few times.\n\nSo, the next day, I took the bag to the store and explained the situation. I also told them that I paid a lot of money for that bag even after getting a good discount. I also argued that the bag was actually made out of poor materials and as such, they should have given me a full refund. Luckily, the manager understood the gravity of the situation and gave me a full refund."

    "Answer": "It would be probably 1 year or so when I bought a cell phone and went through a horrible experience. I bought a Nokia C8 cell phone from a Nokia shop in the city shopping mall. I saved the amount to purchase a cell phone over 6 months that would allow me to use the internet and install applications. Due to my budget deficiency I though Nokia C8 would be a good choice and the salesman also convinced me to purchase this particular one. I spent almost half an hour for testing the phone before purchasing it.  \n\nI used the cell phone for about a month and I was very happy with its performance. It was a touch phone and mostly operated with the fingertip. All of a sudden one day I noticed that the touch functionality is not working and hence I am unable to use it and do anything. I restarted the phone and I found it okay again. But that problem kept reappearing over and over again and I took the phone to the service centre. After a week I took back it home and used smoothly for 2 weeks or so and sadly the problem reappeared. That was a very frustrating experience and I explained my daunting experience to the customer care officer and he assured that they would fix it. But to my surprise, I found the problem again. That day I decided to through it in the dustbin and bought a new cell phone by a different brand and manufacturer. Though I have not thrown it away to the dustbin, I placed it in a box with old and unused materials. I later bought a new cell phone by Sony and found it really cool."

    "Answer": "In my 35 years of life, I must say that I have been lucky to have the opportunity to live with some really good neighbours. But, just like there will always be at least one bad apple in a bag full of this fruit, no matter how hard we try to separate from the good ones, I also am currently dealing with one irritating neighbour lately.\n\nCurrently, I am living in an affluent neighbourhood because I couldn’t find any other closer place near my office. Besides, public transportation from that area is also pretty reliable. Therefore, even though, I am paying a rather hefty amount of rent for my little condominium, the proximity of this place to my job and its reliable public transportation system have made it an ideal place for me to live until, of course, my new neighbour, Mr. Raj Nath Singh, moved into my next condo. Mr. Raj Nath is not such a bad guy, after all, as far as his behaviour is concerned, since he talks pretty much to every person, except the cleaning ladies, in our neighbourhood, but when it comes to leaving his trash outside of his entrance for days, cigarette smoking habit and leaving the cigarette filters to everywhere, and listening to loud music at late night, nobody could really beat him!\n\nIn fact, his cigarette filter littering habit to all over the place around the condominium complex became so rampant and unbearable that the cleaning ladies have been finally forced to complain about this bad habit of Raj Nath to the condominium management authority because the cleaning ladies are just so tired of cleaning them every day.   \n\nAnyway, all of my neighbours are thinking about talking to Mr. Raj about his behaviour and how they are negatively affecting an overall peaceful and clean environment of our neighbourhood. We are also planning to suggest the condominium management authority to move him into an isolated corner or condo of the building, so that rest of the residents doesn’t have to deal with his irritating behaviour anymore if he fails to change his habits and behaviours."

    "Answer": "Most of our neighbours are amiable and well-behaved and they are good neighbours except Mr. Deun who seems very irritating to me. He is living in our community for about 3 years after he bought the house from the previous owner. So he is our neighbour for the last three years and shortly after he started living here people started noticing his annoying behaviours. \n\nHe is a retired person who has only 4 family members and though other family members are well-behaved, this person has some issues that make him a bad neighbour. He does not behave politely and often we find him rude with others. He often shouts on very silly issues. Even with kids, he behaves rudely.\n\nHe often complains about people standing in front of his house while it is a street and people stand there for a while to look for an auto. In my opinion, he has no right to yell with the neighbours who play in the nearby playground. He does not go out very often and stays at his home most of the time. But he complains about everything, about everyone. Since he has complaints on other people, he should have followed the strict rules not to disturb others but in reality, he does the opposite. He sometimes shouts with his family members that other people can hear and that's very disturbing especially in the middle of the night.\n\nI remember him scolding a 10 years girl who mistakenly entered in his garden and just enjoyed the flowers. She did nothing and Mr. Deun acted very impolitely with her. People in our locality sometimes make fun of him for his behaviours and usually avoids him from the social gathering. He has a habit of advising people while he does not listen to anybody's request. Thus I find him very annoying.\n\nI am not sure what to do to reduce his annoyance but I guess we should talk to him very politely and try to make peace with him. He is not a type of person who would yield to any logic or good intention. So if he does not heed to polite conversation, the local senior persons can sit with him to short out the problem. His family members can contribute to making him understand that the way he behaves with others is not acceptable and is not a good sign. Finally, if nothing can be done to change him, we should avoid him and ignore his disturbance. He is not a kid whom we can teach the basic of mannerism and social responsibilities. So, in my opinion, a polite discussion can be effective and if not there is nothing we can do to change his behaviours."

    "Answer": "I don’t exactly recall that many occasions when I was congratulated, primarily because, over the years, I have remained more of an “under-achiever” rather than a bold and successful person. But, I guess that my luck decided to smile on me also once when I also got some sort of recognition and congratulation for something which I never thought I would ever be able to pull off.\n\nYes, it is hard to believe that I got congratulated by a group of people, who had never taken me seriously prior to that pleasing moment because I helped my company save a lot of unnecessary costs.\n\nAnyway, here is how the story went. About 5 years ago, I had just started working as a Jr. Accounting Analyst at a small electronics appliance manufacturing company. But, when I started my job there, the company was already struggling financially. Of course, that was not exactly any of my business because, frankly speaking, I was just happy to have a job there. But, I could still feel the tension and commotion in and around the offices of my company concerning the direction of the company. Anyway, while we all were worried about the direction of the company, one day, we all were called at a meeting by our company chairman who asked us to prepare some reports on how to cut the high costs of running the company. So, we all got busy finding the reasons behind such high costs and preparing reports on it. Once all the reports were submitted, it was time to know which report(s) got the best reviews and remarks. And, to my surprise, I found that it was my reports which got the best comments and remarks. In fact, the company board of directors even called me at their office and congratulated me for the findings.\n\nNeedless to say, I felt so happy and speechless about the congratulation. After that congratulation from my company board of directors, I thanked them while also realizing for the first time that I also had some good potential in me for a successful career ahead of me."

    "Answer": "We all get appreciations for the good things we do for others or for our great achievements or personal excellence. One such occasion when I was congratulated was the time when our debate team won the district/ county level championship.\n\nIt was 2001 and I was a student of grade 8. I was an active member of our school debate team and had participated in different solo and team debate competitions. The yearly inter-school division/ county level championship is considered to be a prestigious tournament and the final is broadcasted on local TV channels as well as on the radio. Our school had never been able to win the championship before 2001, though some of the debate teams participated till the semi-final round of the championship. This year I was the captain of the debate team and to everyone's great surprise, we won the final. Most of the people in our city watched the final on TV and had been very excited, happy and proud that we won. The school arranged a ceremony to congratulate us for our achievement and I found more than 5 hundred students, their guardians and local people were present there. I was so proud, happy and excited about the occasion and when all those people started congratulating me, I felt like I was flying above the sky.\n\nLater, I received many congratulations and appreciations in my life, but the excitement and joy I felt on that occasion were incomparable. We walked through the long line towards the stage and people stood up and clapped their hands and were greeting us. Out teachers, local political leaders, upper-level government employees and renowned persons of the locality were also present there. The program lasted for 2/3 hours and we got many gifts and bouquets as well."

    "Answer": "They say that there is no end to learning. In fact, there are so many things in this world to learn, but unfortunately, I neither have the time nor the money to do so. But, one thing, I really want to learn for sure, is the \"Japanese\" language.\n\nBy the way, I started to dream about learning the Japanese language since the time when my father had introduced me to a team of Japanese Agricultural experts about 10 years ago. By the way, my father (now a retired person) used to work as a senior official at a government office of my country as an agricultural expert that allowed him the opportunity to meet the same kind of professionals from many other countries in order to exchange their views and opinions on different agricultural issues.  \n\nAnyway, after introducing me to those Japanese experts, my father whispered to me that the Japanese people have some of the most brilliant minds in the world, and we can learn a lot of things from them. My meeting with them was very brief, and my English was very poor back then, but still, I managed to figure out that they were very polite and civilized people in their behaviour. In fact, it was after that meeting that I started to make some pen friends from Japan and learn about their language and culture on and off. But, I knew that it was never going to be enough to learn a different language or culture. So, now I am also planning to enrol at a Japanese language school in the near future in addition to collecting some useful language videos from the Japanese cultural centre of my country.\n\nAnyway, learning the Japanese language would help me to understand the culture, lifestyles and traditions of Japanese people which I have really admired since my childhood. Besides, it would also allow me to learn about some of their innovative ideas and incorporate them into our culture and working style. Finally, learning this great language would also allow me to have better employment opportunities since there are many successful Japanese companies all over the world."

    "Answer": "I have a long desire to learn how to play the piano. Even after my desire and passion, I have not been able to learn it. If I ever get the time and opportunity to learn it, I would grab the chance.\n\nI am not sure exactly when this passion grew in me, but I can guess it was something that came in my mind after I saw a foreign movie where an actor played this instrument. The movie was related to a musician's life and he mostly played the piano and sang songs.\n\nIn the movie, the actor played the piano 3-4 times and the quality of the music was really good. Possibly from that time, the passion started to grow in my mind. I work as a computer programmer and have no intention to do any serious type of music, but I want to learn to play the piano. If I get spare time and my schedule allows me, I will get admitted in a piano lesson in my city. Not many opportunities are there but I heard that there are 2/3 musicians who teach enthusiast people the piano for a high payment. I will probably get admitted to such a program and would keep learning.\n\nI will need to save around $1000 to get admitted into the piano lesson and hopefully will have this amount at the end of next year. Then I will talk to the musicians who offer the lesson and would pick one to learn from. I'll allow me to be free at least 2 days in a week to participate in the lesson and I would practice at least for an hour daily. I know it takes a great determination, passion and talent to learn a creative thing like piano, but I believe, I will be able to achieve it."

    "Answer": "I would say, I want to learn computer programming in the future. More specifically, I want to learn C# (C Sharp) and PHP which are two very common yet powerful programming languages. Besides, I want to enhance my skill in database programming so that I can combine those skills to develop great desktop and web-based software and applications.\n\nI come from a commerce background and I have finished my undergraduate degree in business studies. During my 4th and 5th terms in the university, I got admitted to a computer training centre and learned the basics of computing and programming. At that time I was introduced to the C programming language and I found that being able to write codes to develop software is a great and unique skill. I found that I was coding very passionately at that time and I came to the decision that I would spend at least a year to learn computer programming. I want to learn it to enhance my skill, to get a job in the Information Technology field and to develop some great software. Without knowing these programming languages, I will not be able to develop those applications and software.\n\nThough I have learned some basics of C programming language, there are still so many things that I do not know about programming. As computerisation is a must in every field of work, I want to prepare myself for this in advance. I need to learn more about programming to meet the great demands of the application of the computer.  \n\nI have decided to get admitted to a large IT training institute in our city and I would get enrolled in programming language courses. Besides, I would invest a great deal of my personal time to practise and would take help from the Internet to become an advanced programmer. Online video tutorials and podcasts on learning to code would make things easier for me, I believe.  \n\nAs I have already told, I want to build up my career in Information Technology related field and without learning those programming languages, it would be quite impossible for me. I want to develop some great software and make a great contribution to this field. Honestly, I am quite ready to dedicate my time and effort to achieve this."

    "Answer": "In the past, I tried a number of hobbies, but I just couldn’t stick with them for too long, probably because of the age factor. But, at this point in my life, I must say that I have found a hobby which I could probably enjoy for the rest of my life without ever getting bored.\n\nThe name of this particular hobby is called “internet surfing and collecting information from it”. Yes, you heard it right. My favourite hobby nowadays is surfing the internet. I also think that more and more people should consider surfing the internet as their hobbies because there are just so many interesting things to learn from the world wide web that it is almost impossible to get a better view of the world in which we live without surfing the internet.\n\nAt least, I have been doing this for the last three years or so, and I just love it. Besides, what could be a better hobby than learning about the world around us with just a click of a mouse? The best thing about this hobby is that I can enjoy it anytime from the comfort of my home. You want to learn about a unique aspect of a particular culture or tradition? Well, the internet has it whether you want just some written/text information or an actual video of it. You are interested to learn about the recipes of some delicious foods? The internet will provide you with tons of videos on it for you. Like these, there are so many things that we can learn by surfing the internet if you really have the intellectual acumen to put all the information in the proper context. Now, why would I think of going outside to enjoy some hobbies while I can do it right at my home with my family members and the loved ones?\n\nAnyway, this hobby is important for me because it stimulates my mind and brain unlike anything else. Besides, the wealth of information, I receive from the internet, helps me make a lot of informed decision which otherwise wouldn’t be possible that easily."

I will tell you what the hobby is; how long I have been doing it; who I do it with and why it is important to me.\n\nMy hobby is running!  I know I do not really look like a runner, and it is true I am not very fast, but this is still the activity that I like to do in my spare time.\n\nI have not been running for very long.  I started running just 18 months ago, as I decided I needed to get fit, and I thought it would be a cheap way to exercise.  I did not expect to enjoy myself. Near to where I live, there is a park.  It is very beautiful with trees and streams.  Each Saturday a large group of about 500 people meet at 9.00 a.m. in the morning and go for a 5 km run together. This event is called Parkrun, and it happens in over 300 different places in the UK each week. I was nervous when I first went but found the group was friendly and encouraging.  Now I go every week, and I even have trained for some longer races 10 km and my longest was 20 k.m.!\n\nI have made lots of friends through running.  However, the best surprise was that when I went to my local Parkrun, I met someone I had not seen for over 30 years!  We had been at school together but did not keep in touch.  We had both moved to the new city of Sheffield and did not realise we lived so close to each other.  Now I run with this friend every week, and we go for breakfast each Saturday after our run.\n\nRunning is important to me because it keeps me fit, has helped me make new friends, and it has shown me that I am not too old to try new things!  I hope you all find activities that you enjoy doing in your spare time!"

Sometimes I write on how-to and tutorials which are helpful for people looking for it. Sometimes I write on books I read, movies I watch or about new things I learn and that helps me observing those in a different perspective.

    "Answer": "Today I am going to talk about an activity that I do in my spare time. I will explain what the hobby is; how long I have been doing it; who I do it with and why it is important to me.\n\nI don’t think you will be able to guess what my hobby is because it is quite unusual! In my free time, I work at an Alpaca Farm! An alpaca is an animal that is kept for its fleece, they look a little bit like sheep but with a very long neck! They are related to camels and llamas which you may recognise more easily. They usually live in South America, but there is an Alpaca Farm near to me in Sheffield and I work there at weekends. Although it is called an Alpaca Farm, in fact, there are lots of different animals there: horses; goats; sheep; some ducks and hens and even some llamas.\n\nWorking with the alpacas and the other animals on the farm means I have to get there early in the morning. I help to feed the animals and clean up after them. Sometimes I have to drive a tractor to take hay and water out to the horses. Often there are visitors to the farm and I will give them a guided tour and introduce them to all the different animals. At some times of the year, I help with special jobs to care for them, such as giving injections to protect them from illnesses or trimming their toenails if they get too long. My favourite time of year to help is in the spring when baby Alpacas are born. New-born alpacas have to stand up very quickly and within hours are drinking milk from their mothers and running around – it is amazing to watch.\n\nI work on the farm with the farm manager. He is a very kind and funny man. Although we might not seem to have much in common on the surface, we get on really well together. We laugh and talk all the time whilst we are getting the jobs done.\n\nAlthough my hobby is unusual it is very important to me. My full-time job is in indoors in an office and a lot of the time I am sitting down, so at weekends I like to get outside into the countryside and do some physical work that is completely different. I love animals, the fresh air and the exercise. I also really enjoy talking with the farm manager as he can tell great stories. In the winter though it can be very cold, and trudging through 3 foot of snow to feed the animals is really exhausting. On those days I am glad that working with the Alpacas is just a hobby, I can spend the rest of the week in the warm!"

    "Answer": "Different people have different ideas about their versions of the most beautiful natural sceneries while I have my own. But, unfortunately, I am not really a poet nor do I have the talents, skills or proper choice of the words to describe one of the most beautiful natural scenery I have ever seen. Still, I would like to go ahead and give it a try to do some justice to this topic.\n\nThe most naturally beautiful scenery, I am talking about, is a little natural reserve of my country which I visited along about a few years ago. The place was surrounded by green mountains and forests. There was no ocean in that reserve, but the beautiful lake there was no less beautiful and inviting than an ocean. There were six mountains in that place, and each of those mountain tops was competing with each other to glow like a piece of heaven on earth with just about enough natural light on them. There was a huge but luscious green valley in that area that stretched up to the feet of those mountains as if it wanted to provide some touch of softness into the rugged mountainous terrain. The place looked so beautiful, and the natural smell of the luscious green there was so intoxicating that I felt like I could spend the rest of my life there. Besides, the calming effect of the beautiful lake on my mind and body felt like a supernatural experience to me.\n\nAll in all, I think, it was the most beautiful natural scenery, I have ever seen, because I don’t think that it has ever been affected or destroyed by human-created pollution. The place looked so beautiful to me that I actually forgot about all the worldly worries as long as I was there while enjoying the little hide and seek game of mountains with the sunlight and chirping of the birds. Finally, the place seemed so peaceful that even the wind seemed to be too careful to blow with speed lest it had upset the natural quietness and serenity of that place."

It was in a remote area and the natural scenery I saw there was the most beautiful natural scenery I have ever seen. It was in (...say the name of a place...) and the small river, the hill, the green fields and the blue sky made a combination that I felt something out of the world. I saw it in one autumn evening when I went to explore the surroundings of the village. That was an awe-inspiring scenery that I will never forget. I saw this scenic beauty in 2011 and it was mid-autumn season then.\n\nMy friend, I and one of my friend's cousin were present at that time and I heard from my friend that his village was a very beautiful place. I could not believe how much beautiful it was until I saw it with my own eyes.\n\nWe left for the river in the evening and I was amazed to notice the hill and the sloping road track beside it. The river was flowing gently and the vast paddy fields were all around us. I heard the chattering of the birds in the green trees and the sound was creating harmony in my ears.\n\nTo me, this was a truly amazing feeling to witness natural scenery that could exist only in our imagination. I have seen many rivers, hills and paddy fields but in my friend's village, they were arranged in such a way which is only possible in an artist's picture. The blue sky seemed very nearer to the horizon and the vast green all around us make me feel like visiting a fairyland."

    "Answer": "I never really needed to worry about my health or diet in the past because I have remained a reasonably healthy person for the most part of my life except suffering from some occasional flue and fever. But, about 6 months ago, my doctor told me that I was a bit too overweight for my age, and I was at the risk of being diabetic.\n\nNeedless to say, the doctor’s findings came to me as a piece of shocking news because, frankly speaking, I never really thought that I would have to worry about such health issues, especially, my overweight issue. But, it happened and I needed to get rid of that extra 10 kilos, which I gained over the years, except that it was a difficult thing to do.\n\nSo, the first thing, that I did, was to start consuming lesser and lesser carbohydrate, especially, the freshly-made “round flatbread” made from brown flour, which I just loved eating in my breakfast. The diets for my lunch and dinner also changed from eating meat and fishes to consuming vegetables. The diet control continued for a good 3 month time or so, but unfortunately, I wasn’t getting the expected result in my weight loss. Of course, the doctor also had told me that I would need to do some intensive physical exercises every day for about at least 6 months, but I was just too lazy to do that because it would put me on a tight schedule to go to my job and finish it on time. But, I still took the risk and started running for about an hour every day. Finally, after some extensive physical works and diet control, I was finally about to lose about 8 kilos of my weight.  \n\nNeedless to say, I felt really happy and relieved about the result, particularly, after making a lot of adjustments with my regular work and life schedules. Besides, after losing that extra weight, I felt that I had become more energetic than before as I felt much better and confident about myself as far as my look and shape were concerned."

    "Answer": "In our life, we do so many difficult things knowingly and unknowingly. For some difficult tasks, we get appreciation and some remain unnoticed by others.  \n\nI would like to describe one of the difficult jobs I did and was appreciated as well. It was an event when I was around 18 years old and saved a little boy who was drowning in a pond. That day I was near a big pond in our town and all of a sudden I noticed a human hand in the water. No other part of the little boy's body could be seen except his hand that he was desperately trying to get up at the last moment of his life. Initially, I thought that I was just hallucinating and nothing was in the water but instantly I changed my mind and had been sure that it was a boy who was drowning. I took off my shoes and jumped into the water. Then I realised my mistake that I have not pointed out the exact place where I thought someone was sinking. \n \nI desperately swam and went to the approximate place after I struggled for a few minutes. But there was none to be found. I started feeling very helpless and found some people were looking at me with curious eyes. I shouted that I saw a boy was drowning and trying to save him. I found 2-3 others also get into the water to find the boy. I felt overwhelmed by the urge to find the boy. All of a sudden I saw the flash on water and quickly reached there. I felt someone who I had felt with my body and I tried to pull out him from the water. But to my surprise, it seems impossible for me to bring the boy out of the water. \n \nI used all of my force, energy and determination and will to get the boy from the water. I had to struggle a lot and I was sure how long it took me to bring him up. To me, it seemed like an eternity and finally, I had been able to grab the boy firmly and swam towards the land. I was worried because the boy had already lost his conscience and I tried my best to help him to breathe. I pulled down and up my hands very strongly over his chest and finally, he coughed. I felt very tired and yet happy that the boy was out of danger. Some people came to extend their helping hands and they took the boy to the nearby hospital. I went to the hospital and returned home when the boy was completely safe. \n \nI felt really proud to be able to save the boy and the gratefulness I saw in the boy's parents is something I will never forget. People appreciated my bravery and efforts and I also felt very relieved and proud."

    "Answer": "In this age of information and technology, it is almost impossible not to know about a nation or a country as famous and important as German. I am glad that I know about this country well enough to talk a thing or two about it.\n\nWell, it is not really necessary to introduce German anew. I started to learn about this great nation right after starting high school when I was studying Geography. Later on, I came to know a lot about it by reading newspapers, books, travel journals and watching TV programmes.\n\nFrom what I have learnt so far about this great country, I have no hesitation to suggest that German is one of the very few versatile countries among the league of nations, boasting over two millennia of history, which, for good and bad, shaped the world as we know it today. Especially, its tremendous impact in shaping the history of the world for the last century, after forcing two devastating world wars on the world, just can’t be denied.\n\nGerman is also a very beautiful country, and it has a deep-rooted and fascinating culture, which expresses itself in the architecture, in the music, in the literature, in the philosophy, in ways of thinking about the world and so on. In fact, sometimes, I am even tempted to think that there is actually no greater culture than the German one. German is also the largest economy in Europe.\n\nAnyway, I am interested in this country for a number of reasons, but the main reasons are its ingenuity and its ability to excel at many things, such as automobiles, electric appliances, and of course, efficiency.\n\nHowever, what I like most about German is that I think German is a great role model for other nations, especially, in its stunning economic success after the destruction of the 2nd world war. I also like the fact it has emerged as one of the most deeply rooted and stable democracies on the planet. Finally, I also like how this great nation has confronted the darkest aspects of its past – 2nd world war, by some astonishingly thorough, but remorseless soul-searching."

    "Answer": "I love learning about different nations and cultures from around the world because it allows me to have a greater understanding of the world and its affairs. Anyway, while I like all the nations and countries in their own merits, today I would like to talk about a nation which, I think, I know pretty well.\n\nThe name of this nation is “Switzerland”. Anyway, Switzerland, officially known as the Swiss Confederation, situated in the confluence of western, central, and southern Europe. It is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons (meaning, member states of the Swiss Confederation) with federal authorities seated in Bern.\n\nSwitzerland also happens to be one of those few countries which are landlocked. It has an area of about 15,940 square miles and this is probably the country in the world which has 4 different official languages, including German, French,  Italian, and Romansh. By the way, I fell in love with this beautiful country when I first came to learn about it in my high school from the geography class. After that, I also have learned a great deal about this country by reading travel guides and watching travel channels.\n\nI am interested in Switzerland not only because it is arguably one of the most beautiful and safest countries in the world, but also because of its extraordinary economic and political stability due to its neutral behaviour when it comes to international conflicts and power politics.\n\nAnyway, I like this nation because, for centuries, it has kept away from all sorts of international conflicts in a very clever and diplomatic manner. I also like Switzerland because of its stunning natural beauties. Besides, I like this great nation also because even though it has so many ethnic groups from all the neighbouring countries, it has never witnessed any racial, political or ethnic tensions, which makes a nation truly civilized. Finally, I also love this great nation because of their creativity, especially, in offering the world the best and most famous watches as well as the most delicious chocolates. All in all, Switzerland is a truly unique nation in all aspects."

    "Answer": "Experiencing the first day at work, or where one studied for the first time can always be a unique one. I don’t think that I will be able to remember about the experience of studying at a place where I studied for the first time, because it was a long time ago, but I can certainly remember my first day at work of my current job.\n\nI will start with the description of what kind of building it was located in. My first impression of the building was that it was a rather tall building even though it had only 10 storeys. I think I felt like that, probably, because most of the other buildings around it were not more than 5 or 6 storeys. Occupying entire floor, which was no less than 3000 square feet in size, my IT firm was located on the 3rd floor. The building has both the stairs and lift facilities even though I felt that the stairs were just a bit too stiff to climb for a regular person.\n\nThe great thing about the building was that each of its floors was fully equipped with fire extinguishing tools, and they all had large windows in order to allow enough natural light and air. Built with a rather simple architectural plan, this building was closed to a busy commercial area, and it was painted with a cream colour. My office was also fully equipped with all kind of modern facilities. However, regardless of the building, it was important for me to work there because I was offered a full-time job there, and a good one in that.  \n\nAnyway, at the end of my first day at work in that building, I felt like it was a perfect facility to work in because the overall working environment there was really nice.  \n \nI was pleased with my first-day work experience in that building. It was a modern facility with all kinds of amenities, and it offered a nice working environment, with very limited noise from the activities and commotion outside of the building."

    "Answer": "I am currently working in a company and I still remember the first day of my job. This is my second job and I have worked for the first company for about 2 years. After I finished my graduation I applied in some companies and was interviewed by them. One day I got a call from the HR head of the company that, I have been hired and expected to join them from the next Sunday. I was very excited and happy to get the job.\n\nI did my preparation part to start the office and reached the office 30 minutes earlier. The office was in a 10 story building and the office was on the 6th floor. They had more than 90 employees. This was a modern building with a big yard in front of it.\n\nThen I contacted the HR head and submitted my academic and other relevant documents. The HR asked me to sit on a couch and after 30 minutes or so, he returned. In the meantime, I noticed other employees arrived and went to their work desks. Most of them looked at me and one person asked me if I am waiting for someone. I explained that I was joining from that day and he congratulated me. I was feeling a little bit nervous and noticed that my heart was beating faster! The messenger came to me and offered me a cup of coffee. After the HR head came back, he gave 2-3 forms including the contact papers and asked me to read them all and fill up the forms. I read the papers and filled up the forms and gave them to the HR Manager. He then took me to some of the key employees and introduced me to them. Then he showed me my desk and I sat over there. Since this was the first day of my office, I did not have any particular task. I started feeling easy after I sat on the desk and started using the computer. The computer was pre-configured and I went through the company website and learned lots of new information about their service and product offerings.\n\nI took my lunch in a nearby cafeteria and came back to my desk again. Thus the clock ticked to 5:30 pm and I noticed others were leaving. I asked the HR Manager and left with some of the employees.\n\nI felt very comfortable at the end of the day and the hesitation I had has been removed and I was happy for the reason that the office environment and colleagues were very friendly."

    "Answer": "It is a rather interesting topic because I have always wanted to organise a surprise party for my friends, but I haven’t yet managed to do that so far. However, I would still like to share my ideas here about how exactly I would like to organise a surprise party for my friend.\n\nAnyway, whenever it comes to organizing a surprise party, the “birthday party” almost automatically comes to our minds, except, of course, my surprise would be organised in order to commemorate a wedding anniversary of one of my best friends.\n\nAnyway, to give a surprise wedding anniversary party, I would choose a nice and big restaurant which has all the arrangements for such a surprise party. Of course, for that, I would first need to order a big wedding anniversary cake with a very nice looking flower on top of it. Then, I would also prepare a nice stage (hidden from the public, of course) in that restaurant, with the names of my friend and his loving wife, plastered all over, and decorated with beautiful flowers and colourful paper rosettes. I would like to turn the stage into a dreamy place with all kinds of beautiful lightings. To put the icing on the cake, I would also like to compose a romantic song with the name of my friend and his wife in it.\n\nFinally, when the anniversary date approaches, I would invite my friend and his wife to the restaurant either before one day of the anniversary date or after. Once, they arrive at the restaurant, the romantic song, I just mentioned about, would be played from the background to call my friend and his wife onto the stage in order to surprise them on their anniversary.   \n\nAnyway, I would organise this surprise party to show how I really care about my friend and his wife, who have been through thick and thin with me throughout many years. Besides, I also want to help my poor friend show his love and appreciation for his loving wife since he keeps forgetting about his wedding anniversary pretty much …well… every year."

    "Answer": "It is not always easy to organise a surprise party and I did organise such 3-4 surprise parties for my family members and friends. The surprise party I would like to do is for one of my friends on his birthday. He is going to turn to 26 next February and I'd through a completely surprise party for him at his home.\n\nThere is a good chance that his family members would organise a birthday celebration on the day, so my planning would be to through it at 12:01 am at night. I would keep everything secret from him and would let only 2-3 friends know about the planning of the party who would also participate in organising it. We would buy a big birthday cake and birthday candles in the evening and 6-7 friends would gather together. We will buy our individual gifts for him and would go to him home exactly at 12:00 am. We will then notify his mother and would let her know that we are planning a surprise party for him. At exactly 12:01 am we'll enter his house and probably there would be a lot of shouting and birthday wishing. That would be a big surprise to my friend as he would have no clue about our arrival at his home on his birthday.\n\nHe is a very good friend of mine and I remember him to be very supportive to me in several times. A birthday is a very special day for a person and people become very happy when he finds that people who care him also celebrates and congratulates him on special occasions like a birthday or a wedding ceremony. I would organise the surprise party to make him happy and to enjoy the occasion."

    "Answer": "Well, in this modern world, finding a peaceful place is sometimes difficult but luckily I happen to know one such place where I have been to a few times.\n\nThe name of this place is called “Ladakh”, the highest plateau in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and mostly isolated from the rest of the civilization. Some people call it “the land of snows” while the others call it “little Tibbet”.\n\nBut, whatever they call it, Ladakh undoubtedly seems to be one of the most peaceful places on this earth to me, with its picturesque beauty, unique culture, Buddhist monasteries, stunning alpine lakes and amazing Himalaya mountain views in addition to the wonderful trekking routes. But, on the other hands, it is also freezing cold – so cold that even the boiling hot spring water freezes as soon as it oozes out of the ground - daylight is short, and can be very treacherous to travel during the winter. In fact, this region so remote and hostile that there’s a famous Ladakhi saying, which says that “The land is so barren and the passes so high that only our fiercest enemies or our best friends would want to visit us”. By the way, I learned about this beautiful and peaceful place on a popular TV travel show, and also by reading different travel journals.\n\nAnyway, I like this place because they are some of the friendliest people on this earth. In fact, the villagers in Ladakhi strongly disapproved of public displays of anger, disharmony, or discontent. They idealized a peaceful, united, harmonious community, free of conflict and anger. Conflict, they felt, is a manifestation of a society that is degenerate. Besides, when conflicts arise between villagers, they are resolved by the elected head of the village, called the “goba”, who listens to both sides of the case and makes a decision as to which of the parties may have to pay a fine or make restitution.\n\nNow, if a person is not able to find peace in such place with nobody really to poke their noses in his/her affairs, while also watching the beautiful snow and having a secret conversation with the sky, almost touching its earth, I don’t think that he/she will ever find peace anywhere else in this world."

    "Answer": "My grandfather's house is a peaceful place that I visit around 2-3 times a year and like very much. This is in the village (...say a village name...). My grandfather’s house is a big house with lots of open spaces and a river is flowing nearby.\n\nIn this big house only 3-4 people and 2-3 servants live as my grandparents are no longer in this world and my uncles, aunts are mostly living in different big cities. There are 7-8 rooms in the house and a big garden in front of the house. The servants take care of the garden and keep the place neat and clean. Since I live in a city and work for a big company where I have lots of responsibilities to perform, city life seems very busy and even sometimes chaotic to me.\n\nWhenever I visit my grandfather’s house, I get the impression that I have come to the most peaceful place in the world. I have not seen many places and have not travelled extensively but in my experience the peace and the mental tranquillity I enjoy being here are unmatched. One of the reasons can be my childhood memories; as I have spent my childhood at this very house and whenever I go there, lots of memories flashback and give me a pleasure that I do not get from elsewhere.\n\nI know this place from my childhood as I was born and grown up here. This place is quite different to me as I leave behind my busy life and come here to relax both mentally and physically. The memory of my departed grandparents, my childhood and other happy events are related to this place. I can get fresh air, meet some of my relatives, enjoy the country life and stay close to nature here and for all those reasons, I like this place very much."

    "Answer": "I like to laugh and be happy whenever there is a reason for it. Cracking jokes makes us happy and so do many funny incidents which we experience in our daily life. However, today, I would like to talk about a funny incident that happened to me a while ago. The incident took place at a birthday party about a few years ago. It fact, it was a birthday party of one of my little nephews.\n\nEverybody, including all of my family members, relatives and the little friends of my nephews, was invited to the party on a lovely evening in order to enjoy the party. By the way, the party was supposed to be concluded as early as possible because all the little guests, friends of my nephew, needed to return to their homes safely before it was getting too late at night. So, the party formally started at around 8 pm with opening up the gift boxes ceremoniously. Once, we were done with opening the gift boxes, the time came for singing the “happy birthday to you” song, and we all sang the song in order to wish a very happy birthday to my nephew.  Finally, the moment, we all had been waiting for, finally had arrived, and we were ready to cut the birthday cake except, of course, the cake had already been cut!\n\nWithout having a clue about what had really transpired, we all started to look at each other’s face until we suddenly noticed two little boys who were busy eating cake in a corner of the room. Once approached by me, the boys spared no time in divulging their secret about eating their “fair shares” of cakes with a very happy face instead of waiting for others! Needless, to say, we all burst into laughter.\n\nAnyway, what I really remember the most about the funny incident is that the boys, who decided to eat their “fair” shares of cakes, looked so confident and happy as if they really had achieved some extraordinary “feat” by managing to cut the birthday cake way ahead of others."

    "Answer": "The funny incident that I remember occurred was almost 2-3 years ago that I would like to describe. That time I was a student at a university and I was in my 7th semester. We had a group assignment and to collect data we went to some libraries after our class. In the evening, I found that my group members are complaining that they are hungry and they need to have some foods.\n\nI found them entering a restaurant and I went with them. One of my classmates ordered some foods directly to the waiter without looking at the menu and after we are done with our foods, I noticed that one of the group mates is asking the group leader to pay the bill. The group leader was astonished as he had not offered the meal and said that he did not have the money to pay the bill. I asked the waiter to bring the bill and we were thundered to look at the amount. It was much higher than the usual price. Though we were a bit worried, we started laughing and enjoying the whole thing. One of the classmates offered to collect all of our money and then pay the bill. We looked at our wallets, pockets & bags and collected the whole amount. There were so many changes and coins there that we had to calculate 2-3 times. But to our surprise, the total amount is still not sufficient to pay the bill.\n\nWe started laughing and I proposed to two of the groupmates to give their cell phones and wrist watched as the alternatives of the bill. These two group mates got serious and were protesting that these would be an insane idea. Rest of us started enjoying their reaction as we found that they have actually taken this seriously.  One of your group mates proposed that we should pay the amount we have with us and ask the manager of the hotel to allow us time to pay the rest of the amount. I told them that the manager would not allow that and would call the police! We enjoyed the event, the dubious looks on some of your classmates and the fact that 2-3 of them have taken the whole thing very seriously and are actually got anxious.\n\nWe stayed there for about 1 hour and noticed that people around us were giving surprising looks as we something very funny and interesting is going on among us. One of my group mates' house was nearby and he proposed that he would go home and bring the money and in the meantime, we would stay there until he arrives. We agreed and waited for him another20 minutes or so. In the meantime, one of the boys told that the classmates who left won’t come back! We laughed at the idea and acted as if it's going to happen for real.  After our classmates returned from home, he paid the bill (with some tips as well!) and then we left the restaurant.\n\nWe then left for our home and I took a taxi and paid the taxi fare from my home. I told the story to other classmates the next day and they found it very funny and interesting as well. This event became famous in our class and we often mentioned the funny things happened that day among us."

Of course, it is not like that I had enjoyed all of those outdoor activities, whether I was doing them for the first time or continuously. However, today, I would like to talk about an outdoor activity which I had started to like from the very first time.\n\nThe name of this activity is “fishing”. But, to be honest, about 20 years ago, I didn’t really like the idea of sitting on the bank of a lake or river in an anticipation of some fish to be kind to take my bait. In fact, I used to think of this outdoor activity as some kind of “hide-and-seek-game” except it was much harder than that because I could see my “prey” only after catching it.\n\nHowever, all that changed when I was finally convinced by one of my cousins to accompany him in order to do some fishing practice with him. In fact, he even assured me that the fishes would eat my baits. So I agreed and went to a nearby lake to catch some fish. By the way, before throwing my fishing wire into the water, my cousin did some tricks with attaching the   .... on my fishing rod. \n\nAnyway, I started to wait, but I was growing little impatient with the waiting as I could see no sign of fish near my fishing rod. Suddenly, I saw that my float was moving and informed it to my cousin. My cousin immediately asked me to pull the rod out of the water and I had caught my first fish! And when we finally left the lake, I had caught 3 fishes! Needless to say, I felt so happy later about that outdoor activity.\n \nAnyway, I would recommend this outdoor activity to my friends because the excitement of catching a fish is simply outstanding! Besides, this outdoor activity would also help learn how to become patient because it takes a lot of patience to catch a fish. After all, the fruit of patience is always sweet."

They were dressed like professional cyclists and were discussing something. That day I was with one of my friends and we went out with our bicycles as part of our evening exercise. My friend and I went closer to the group and heard that they are some members of a bicycling group who do the gathering and cycling as part of their outdoor activity and exercise.\n\nAfter a few minutes, we found that they were planning to round the city in 3 hours with their bicycle and they would start that in the next 30 minutes. The team leader asked us to join them just when we were planning to leave. They made us members of the group and it was free. We started cycling with them starting from this place and went through the major parts of the whole city. Cycling for the whole 3-4 hours was not an easy task and yet we enjoyed it and we were close to the group whole time. After a few hours, we came back to the place where we started and I found that I was totally absorbed and exhausted.\n\nThe team leader congratulated us because it was our first day and we did well. I looked at my friend and he was looked exhausted and tired. The team gave us a membership card and told that they do it twice in a month. Though we had plans for joining them again, we could not do so. I found the whole idea of cycling very interesting and a good chance to meet new people. I felt well that we actually did it and the feeling of travelling the whole city riding a bicycle was thrilling.\n\nI would definitely recommend this activity to anyone capable as it would be a good exercise as well as a chance to know different people who have some common interests."

    "Answer": "There is no alternative to introducing and implementing good laws if we really want to create a better and peaceful world for ourselves and our children. Of course, some people would argue that already there are enough laws like that to do the job. But, I would say that we can always come up with better laws in order to meet the demand of our changing times.\n\nTalking about introducing new laws, I would also like to implement one in my city which would allow our city to impose additional taxes on the car owners if all of their car seats are not fully used and occupied either with human passengers or some other portable items.\n\nI feel the need of introducing such a new law because many of the car owners in my city are thinking that it is their right to own as many private cars as they wish, just because they have money and the permit to drive a new car. This is a very disturbing trend because more and more new cars, with empty seats, are running on our streets, creating very bad traffic jams for the common public like us.\n\nHowever, I also am very aware of the fact that it won’t be easy to introduce such a new law because the car owners, who are rich and powerful, in my city would vehemently oppose such idea. In fact, they would try their best to brand the law as a very controversial one by saying that it would violate their “property-owning rights”, even though the majority of the people in my city would consider this new as a rather popular one.\n\nAnyway, I would like to introduce this new law because, first, it would greatly reduce the traffic jams in our city because more and more people would use public transports. Besides, it would also reduce air pollution in our city because there will be fewer cars on our streets. Finally, the law would also reduce unnecessary noises in our city, which negatively affect our school-going children and patients at the hospitals."

    "Answer": "The place I currently live in is a big city called (...say the name of the city or area you live in…) and it has got lots of problems and issues which need to be addressed. We have lots of laws and rules and many of them need amendment and better implementation. If I am in a position to impose a new law to make my city a better place to live in, I would make a new law that would make it mandatory for every house owner to plant at least 10 trees in their area and would prohibit cutting any tree unless permitted by the law enforcing authority.\n\nA country should have at least 33% forest of the total land area for a natural balance in the country and the existing percentage of trees and forest in our country are alarmingly lower than that. Particularly in our city, this rate is almost less than 5% which makes it an imbalanced city to live in. It is not easy to enhance the forests in this city as it is a populated city and has very minimum open space. So making this rule a mandatory one would help us make the city greener and better.\n\nCurrently, most of the house owners do not have trees on their premises and there are places where this can be done. So if every landlord of the city plants some trees and takes care to grow those properly, that would improve the environment of the city. Moreover, the house owners should not be free to cut any tree whenever they want. They need to take permission and give proper reasons if they really need to cut any tree.\n\nThis would not be an easy law to implement. Lots of house-owners would not be interested in following this newly implemented law and would complain that there is no spare space for doing it. However, if the law is implemented and imposed, over time that would be achievable. Once the consciousness and necessity are understood and we start feeling our obligation towards Mother Nature and our society, many people would feel the importance of it.\n\nThis new law would have a great number of benefits. There is no alternative than to plant trees and keep the environment healthy and this law would make our city a better place to live in."

    "Answer": "I was lucky to have my own room since the time I started going to high school. After that, of course, I have swapped rooms with my siblings a number of times, but luckily, I still can remember the room in which I stayed a considerably long period of time.\n\nIt was one of the main bedrooms of my home – a large but old home –which had already been used by my 2 brothers and one sister before I occupied it. Not sure, what exactly encouraged me to move to this room, but I am assuming that it must have something to do with its perfect size.\n\nBesides, I also must have moved to this room, because I wanted to maintain a safe distance from my parents, since I used to play rather loud music, and my parents just hated loud music. Anyway, I used to do all kinds of things in this room, from sleeping to playing video games with my friends as well as from learning to play the guitar to teaching karate to my school friends. I have used this room to even study night after night I was about to finish high school. This is the room where I learned to use a computer for the first time, thanks to my elder brother.\n\nBy the way, I spent about 6 years of my life in that room until moved out of my house to attend a university. However, if one asks me, why I stayed for so long in that room, I don’t think that I would have a definitive answer for that except I liked the quietness in it.\n\nAnyway, I have some great memory of this room because this is where my elder brothers and younger sister would admonish me out of their genuine love for not studying hard (yes…I was an indiscipline student). Besides, in this room, I have spent a lot of time in planning for my future. Finally, this is the room where I learned how to become a grown-up man by forgetting all the childish behaviours."

    "Answer": "I have stayed in my university hostel for about 5 years and this is the room I would like to talk about. This room was on the 3rd floor of the university hostel and my room number was 230. I shared this room with another roommate and I had a total of 3 roommates during the time I stayed there. This was a medium-size room with the usual furniture for 2 students provided by the university. The best thing about the room was that it was in the corner of the 3rd floor and as a result, it was quieter than other rooms. There were 2 big windows and I got fresh air in summer seasons. The university had its own water supply and electricity supply and because of that, we enjoyed uninterrupted water and electricity supply.\n\nI lived there for a long time and because I was a student at that time, I mostly studied, slept and enjoyed my friend's company there. In the morning I left the room for classes and mostly came back in the evening. I studied till 12.00 and then slept. Sometimes I played indoor games, watched movies, listened to music and cooked in my room. I spent the time there because I was arranged by the university and was inside the university premises. I needed only 5-10 minutes to attend my class from my room and that was very convenient. Another reason I stayed there is the cheap rent which was significantly lower than the cost of living outside the university.\n\nI have lots of memories regarding this room. I have spent a golden time there where I studies, gathered with friends, learned many new things and felt like home. I learned how to cook during my stay there and there are several times the things I cooked were not easy to eat as I had been a horrible cook. Later I developed my skill on cooking and I guess I would have never learned it unless I stayed there.\n\nI often had friends whom I talked to and played with the whole night if we did not have classes the next day. There were some ghost stories regarding this room and my roommate once got freighted because he heard that someone was moaning outside though he found none outside. Since I do not believe in ghost stories, I have never encountered any situation like that.  I cherish the memory I have regarding this room as I have spent a long time there and enjoyed my stay."

    "Answer": "Recently, my younger sister came to visit me from abroad where she is living with her husband. I hadn’t seen her in a long time, and because of that, she thought that I wasn’t being a good brother to her. So, to prove her wrong, I decided to buy her an expensive gift.\n\nThe expensive gift was a wristwatch from one of the most prestigious watchmaking companies in the world. Made in Switzerland, it was one of the most feminine, elegant and classy watches I have ever seen. It is a blued-steel watch (not just a blue colour watch) with a unique bracelet, and it is also waterproof.\n\nOf course, it was a luxury watch all the way, but it was made with such a master class touch artworks that anybody would make mistake to think of it as a fashion watch.  Anyway, the case of this watch is round, and it has only an hour hand and a minute hand. Having a very beautiful and contrasting dial/face colour, the watch would surely attract anybody’s admiration and attention with its metallic gold and bright bezel. Finally, it is a 24-jewel, natural ruby watch, and it has a beautiful golden colour chain, which is in perfect harmony with the colour of the rest of the watch.  \n\nAfter buying this precious gift for my sister, I felt really great because I have searched such a beautiful gift for a long time.  In fact, I have visited at least 2 dozen shops before deciding to buy this very attractive looking gift for the only sister I have.\n\nAnyway, I chose this precious gift, mainly because I wanted to show my little sister how much I really cared for her as a brother. Besides, I also feel that the gift would perfectly match with her overall style and fashion, no matter on whatever occasion she would use it. Finally, I also wanted to make my little sister happy. After all, I don’t think that there would be any greater happiness for a brother than to see an expression of joy and happiness on the face of his little sister."

    "Answer": "The gift I gave to my younger sister recently is the one I would like to talk about. I gave her a cell phone recently. The model of the cell phone is Sony Experia Z and it has Android Operating System. This is a water-resistant cell phone manufactured by Sony Mobile and is a hot one in the market. The cells phone cost me around 40 K and I had to save the money for the last 6-7 months to present her the gift.\n\nI knew that she had been wishing to buy a smartphone for a year but could not do so. I thought to buy her one on her next birthday and started saving the money. I saved almost 7-8 k each month and just before 3-4 days of her birthday, I bought the phone.\n\nI felt really great after I gave the gift to my sister. That was an unexplainable pleasure, amusement, satisfaction that I felt after I saw her bewildering face after she opened the gift. She was so happy that I felt like that was a perfect gift for her. I am sure I would not have felt the same pleasure as I felt giving her the gift doing something else. She had been longing to own a smartphone and after receiving it from me she hugged me.\n\nAs I already told, from her conversation I knew that she wished to own a smartphone that she would be able to use the internet and take quality photographs. From that day, I promised myself that I would buy her one. And I wished to buy her a really good one. I could have bought her a phone for 10k but seriously I wanted to give her the best one that I can accommodate."

    "Answer": "Not sure, if the story, I am about to tell here, is unusual or interesting, but I find it both amazing and fascinating because I have never really done such a thing before.\n\nIt was about a couple of months ago when I and one of my close friends went to an international trade fair in the city, where I live. Of course, it was not the first time that I attended an international trade fair, but this time, it was a bit different for me because this time, I actually wanted to sell something instead of buying something from there.\n\nYes, you heard it right. I truly wanted to become a salesman except, of course, I just didn’t know what I sale, or which store from the trade fair would employ me for at least an hour with no salary. Initially, my friend simply laughed off my idea of becoming a salesperson for an hour. But, when he understood that I was serious, he took me to one of his acquaintances (a supervisor) at one of the stalls there.\n\nWe explained my wish to him, but he also thought that I was joking with him. But, when I challenged him that I would be able to sell at least one of his boutique items (it was a boutique selling store) within an hour, provided that there were customers in his store, he agreed to employ me just for an hour. So, I started to use all of my sales tricks, but the customers were simply not buying into them. On the other hand, my “one-hour” time limit was also about to finish. So, I became even more aggressive with the customers, and I finally did make a sale!\n\nAnyway, it was something really unusual and interesting because I have never really sold a thing in my entire life before making that sale for a profit. Besides, it also brought out the great sales skills in me which I was not aware of up until I experimented with my selling techniques at that international trade fair."

    "Answer": "A few months back while our visit to a friend’s hometown, all of a sudden a friend proposed us to go inside a nearby forest and have a picnic there. This was a plan proposed by Arnold (...say one of your friend's name...) and 4 of our friends agreed to do so.\n\nThis was a bit dangerous as people scarcely go inside the forest and from the local people we have heard different scary and wild stories about this jungle. Our main attraction was the abandoned house inside the jungle and we planned to do the picnic there and take photos of wild lives and the abandoned house. We knew that my friend's guardians won't permit us to do that and hence we planned not to let them know about it upfront.\n\nOn a Thursday morning, we left the friend's house and bought the necessary ingredients, vegetables, food and other things that would be required for the picnic. We entered inside the jungle and to our surprise, the inside was much more open and beautiful than we thought it would be. With some difficulty, we reached near the abandoned house and spent time till the afternoon. This was a very exciting and unusual experience for us. We collected some woods and made an arrangement for cooking. We eat the food we cooked and that was horrible in taste. However, we were looking for adventure and interesting stuff, so the bad food did not kill our spirit. We could not enter the abandoned house as it was blocked and very fragile. We took several photos of the place and we notice some of the wild animals were observing us with suspicion.\n\nI have to confess that was a bit dangerous and imprudent thing to do but we enjoyed our interesting and unusual picnic inside a forest."

    "Answer": "I have had my fair share of training sessions in my not-so-long life as a professional. While some of those training sessions left me overwhelmed and bored, for the most part, the others were interesting enough to hold my attention for a long period of time. Today, I would like to talk about one such interesting training session that I had attended about 5 years ago.\n\nThe training session was held at my company’s corporate head office when I got promoted as an Assistant Project Manager. Of course, I already had learned a little about project management due to working under my Senior Project Manager, and I thought that it would be enough for me to carry on with my responsibilities as an assistant project manager. But, as I went on with my new role, I increasingly felt the need to attend some kind of training sessions.\n\nThe training was to be held in 8 sessions over 5 days, and I was to join a few other staffs at our corporate head office from a few other departments of my company like finance, customer acquisition and quality control. By the way, I was working at one of the largest construction firms in my city back then.\n\nAnyway, although the training session started with some speech from the lead trainer on how to acquire the necessary project management skills in a demanding environment, later on, it also covered important subjects like time management, risk management and effective negotiation skills. Even though the training session was an eye-opener for me in many respects, one of the most exciting parts of them was that it allowed me to find out some of my natural skills which I never knew before.\n\nI learned a number of things from the training session. First thing was that professionals should never stop learning no matter what their positions and level of experiences were. Secondly, I also learned that we can always learn new things by actually cooperating more with each other instead of competing against each other."

The training session was on Advanced Microsoft Office and presentation on PowerPoint. As a B.B.A student, I had a great interest in computing and I attended the session with an enrollment fee of 500. The session was organized by a career-building organisation in our city and they had a good reputation for conducting successful sessions and training programs. Many of my classmates attended the session that was held on the 3rd floor of the company's building.\n\nInitially, we had some doubles about what we would learn from the session as we already knew the basic Microsoft Office functionalities. But after the session started we found that the session was organized by some professionals and aimed for those who already knew some basics.\n\nThe session started at around 10:00 am and ended at 4:30 pm with 2-3 breaks. During the session, the professionals who were conducting the training talked to us about numerous career-related topics and their way of presenting those was very exciting. They told us many interesting facts and sometimes joke as well and we could not restrain ourselves from laughing. The training part went well and was interesting as well since we have learned many new things from it.\n\nThe advanced office functionality they presented was amazing. I never knew that those things were possible with the programs I already knew! Later on, the PowerPoint presentation session went very well. We learned so many things and became very excited. I was so interested that I went home in the evening and at night I tried those lessons and functionality on hands with my computer."

    "Answer": "I never really understood math that great when growing up as a young student. In fact, I would be very happy just to get an average score in math. But, all that changed when I luckily got a new math teacher at my junior college, and I have no hesitation to say that he was/is my most favourite math teacher to this date.\n\nHis name was Mr Shad Reza. We simply used to call him “Reza Sir”, and he used to teach College Algebra. I also heard that he didn’t only have an advanced degree in math, but also a degree in “education”. So, it was generally assumed among his students that he knew a thing or two about how to teach difficult math, and I also agreed with those students as soon as I attended his first math class after starting my junior college.\n\nIn fact, when he came to our math class for the first time, he started his lesson with some very basic math problems which had nothing to do with algebra class whatsoever. Later, he also told us that he was going to make math as easy as counting the numbers. Needless to say, it was also for the first time that I actually became interested in learning match instead of just “passing” the course. The next day, he only joked with us about college algebra to ease our fear. But, as time progressed, he tried so many techniques to teach us math that it was practically impossible for anybody not to learn math. But, what made me like him the most was that he never gave up on his smiley face even when he was frustrated with some of his students.\n\nAnyway, I have never really seen any teacher who had such an easy approach to teach a difficult subject. In fact, it was because of his influence that I became confident about my math skills later on. Besides, he seemed to have such unique techniques to teach math that I never really saw any student asking him any questions even when he was begging them to."

    "Answer": "Environmental pollution is a serious modern-day problem for any county and its cities all over the world, and the situation is only getting worse for the most part. Anyway, today, I would like to talk about the same pollution problem which my city is also facing increasingly.\n\nNot too long ago, my city used to be considered as one of the safest cities in my country as far as environmental pollution is concerned. In fact, many people from around my whole country settled down in my city in the past because of its greenery, clean air and clean water.  But, today, the situation has dramatically changed because its air is not completely safe to inhale because there are just too many vehicles on the roads and streets today that emit carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide. And, we all know how these ingredients pollute our atmosphere and air.\n\nAs far as the surface water of my city is concerned, it is also contaminated because of too much industrial and toxic waste. Another type of indirect environmental pollution, which is affecting my city, is that its lands and trees are being used (some would say “destroyed”) indiscriminately in order to make rooms for residential and industrial buildings. And, as this happens, it takes away the oxygen supplies of my city. Anyway, as this environmental pollution takes place, people in my city are increasingly suffering from lung diseases and other kinds of respiratory problems, especially, during the cold weather.  Besides, the city also has to spend extra money in order to purify its drinking water, which is putting extra pressure on its budget.\n\nThis pollution can be controlled by first limiting the number of private vehicles on the roads to reduce carbon emission in the atmosphere. The city should also put in place a more efficient filtering system in order to stop the industrial toxic waste from entering the source of water supply. Finally, the city should adopt a scheme of planting more trees in and around the city in order to cleanse its polluted air."

    "Answer": "I live in (..say the name of your city..) and this city has got some several issues related to environmental pollution. The major environmental pollutions that this city has are water pollution, air pollution and sound pollution.\n\nThe main reason for these pollutions is overpopulation and rapid and unplanned industrialisation of this city. The city has more than (…say the current population level of this city...) whereas the number should have been far less than that. It is evitable that a large number of populations in a small city always cause environmental pollution as they use more cars, consume more energy and natural resources and create more wastages and noises.  \n\nThe reason for water pollution is the uncontrolled number of industries, factories and other constructions that have been grown up beside the rivers. These factories and industries produce a large number of chemical and other wastages which directly affects the water. Inappropriate and uncontrolled construction is another reason for water pollution in our city. The effect of water pollution is severe, the water supply would be affected and the supply of safe and clean water would be threatened. A large number of people rely on the water of the rivers and they would be directly affected. Lots of people would get sick due to water pollution and those diseases can become epidemics if not controlled and that results in an immense loss of innocent lives.  \n\nAir pollution is also very concerning in this city and the chemical smoke, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emitted from automobiles and industries are the main reason for air pollution. This city has more than millions of automobiles and thousands of industries which are omitting the dangerous gases, and ingredients which are causing the air pollutions.  Air pollution is the direct reason people suffer from various dangerous diseases including lung cancer, asthma, heart disease etc. In fact, the number of people currently suffering from these diseases is alarming and if proper steps are not taken to prevent air pollution immediately, this number would rapidly increase.\n\nSound pollution is produced by the loud horns used by the cars, loud sound used for announcement and cacophony created due to loud sound. Aeroplanes that fly over the resident area created a very loud noise as well. Air pollution is a silent killer that causes lots of serious diseases including hearing and brain cancer. The air pollution directly affects the natural balance by affecting the wild lives.\n\nThe most important thing to reduce pollution in our city is to create public awareness. We are mostly creating that pollution and endangering ourselves, the Earth and other species. Without our awareness and strict determination to prevent our city from pollution, we can’t reduce or prevent it. Strict laws should be introduced and be applied against any environmental pollution and all the illegitimate industries and companies should be banned. The decentralisation of industries and offices can be effective as it would reduce the number of people currently living in this city.\n\nJob opportunities and other facilities should be improved in rural areas so that people can manage works in their own cities and villages other than coming to this city. Education and morality are two important aspects that help people understand the necessity of keeping the city clean and healthy."

    "Answer": "Traffic jam is a reality of the city life, and we have all seen it happen, from slowing down to crawling to complete stop, whether there is a reason for this type of bad traffic or not. Then, minutes later, it begins to move again and then suddenly moving to full speed. 'Why does this happen anyway' is a question many people ask and we all ask 'what could be done about it'!\n\nWell, it happens because even a minor but natural “disruption”, like slight brake of a car or an unexpected bump in the roads, to the flow of traffic can cause a “self-enforcing” chain reaction which eventually amplifies until it creates a wave of slowed or stopped traffic. But, even when cars manage to leave this kind of irritating traffic jam or wave, the jam or wave doesn’t disappear itself as it may gradually drift backwards against the direction of the traffic.\n\nAnyway, sometimes these traffic congestions bring the ‘worst’ in people, people who usually never become “angry”, as we get “agitated” and start blaming each other for the traffic congestion. Of course, people have their reasons for such “agitation” because, to begin with, it wastes their valuable time which otherwise could have been used to spend with their families or used in doing something “constructive”. Besides, when people get stuck in the traffic for longer than “usual”, they usually fail to get their “jobs” done on time, making them look inept or inefficient in the eyes of friends, co-workers and managers. Spending more time on the road also causes people to usually spend more on the fuel cost for their vehicles. As a whole, the country suffers from economic losses.\n\nAnyway, we can control these kinds of traffic congestion if we choose to rely more on public transportation, which can carry and accommodate more people at once, instead of using private vehicles at will and at any time. We could also do things like widen our roads and streets and becoming more cautious in maintaining our cars more frequently in order to avoid “movement interruptions” on the roads, but we could also “build” more “technologically-advanced” cars which could adjust their “speeds” or change the roads/lanes by sensing the traffic jams ahead well in advance."

    "Answer": "I come from (...say the city name…) and this city accommodates a large number of population. Due to this huge population and the increased number of public and private cars, the city often faces bad traffics.\n\nThe number of people living in this city, the cars they are using and the public transportation they need are much higher compared to the number of roads. As a result, the traffic jam often occurs and people have to suffer. Another reason for the traffic jam is the unauthorised parking of cars in the street. People do not often follow the exact traffic rules and because of their insincerity, we often face the horrible traffics in the streets.\n\nThe traffic jam in our city is one of the terrible things the city dwellers have to face. People get stuck on the roads and they have no idea when they would be able to reach their destination. Because of this jam, people often miss important schedules, students can’t reach school in time and the outcome is devastating. Because of the jam in the street people have to schedule accordingly and the total time killed in the street is simply a waste of time.\n\nThere are many steps which should be taken to reduce the jam in the street. First of all the people who are driving in the street should very strictly follow the traffic rules. The traffic control authority should more strictly apply the rules. The number of private automobiles is increasing rapidly. Many single families own multiple cars and thus increase the number of total cars driving in the street. The rule should be imposed on purchasing cars and the price of the fuel could be increased as well. The public transportation system should be improved so that people can travel in public cars. The city has more population than it can comprise and decentralisation of industries, offices and educational institutes can be another solution to this abhorrent problem."

    "Answer": "I don’t really get to spend much time watching TV programs mainly because I remain busy with other priorities in life. But, sometimes, I do enjoy watching different kind of comedy shows and documentaries because they make me “think” differently. Today, I would like to talk about one such comedy show which made a great impression on me.\n\nI watched the program about a couple of years ago in the absence of my family who were out on a visit to see a “terminally” ill relative of them. Coincidently, the comedy show was also about an “elderly” ill person, with “limited” mobility, who wanted to find his “love” for the last time before dying.\n\nBut the problem was, of course, no woman was willing to put up with the old man because he had a very “tight fist”. In other words, he was a very “stingy” man with no intention whatsoever to spend any money on others, even if it meant spending on his “wife”! In fact, he was so “stingy” that he even liked to “sleep” on his money sometimes due to his fear of getting them stolen by others. Anyway, finally, one elderly lady became kind enough to marry him on one condition. And the condition was, the old guy would need to stop sleeping with his money. The guy happily agreed. But, after the marriage, the guy still kept sleeping with his money. The wife saw it and angrily reminded about his “promise”. The guy very calmly answered that “he was not sleeping with his money any more, rather the money was sleeping with him!” Needless to say, that was the moment when I simply burst out in laughter!\n\nI really liked the comedy show mainly because it did highlight on a very natural human instinct which “pushes” people to go to any length, even if it is “lying” or “cheating”, in order to find “love” regardless of age or sex. It also made me realize the fact once again that even though sometimes “money” is what helps us “buy” love, it pushes us away too."

The TV program that made a strong impression on me was a documentary that I watched on the Discovery Channel.\n\nThe TV program was called “The sacrifice of genius” and it was a serial that had 10 episodes in total. I watched every episode and enjoyed them thoroughly. This was mainly a documentary serial which emphasised the sacrifice the famous and genius scientists like Marie Curie, Thomas Edison and 8 other scientists made in their life.\n\nI watched the TV program during the third term of my university years. In our local time, the program was broadcast at 9.00 pm every Thursday. It showed the life and work of the famous scientists and the sacrifices they made for others to make the world a better place. These stories were presented in a fascinating way and each episode was made painstakingly. I got the impression that I was actually watching those great scientists and their works in person!\n\nI have learned so many things about the lives of these scientists and the sacrifices they made. Those sacrifices were unbelievable and after watching this program, I could not stop thinking about those famous scientists and their supreme dedication.\n\nThis program has helped me judge life from a different perspective. I realised that working hard to bring something important for others can be more meaningful than our personal achievements like wealth and fame. I later searched for more details of those scientists and other famous people and learned about their life and work. I was actually inspired by this program and started learning deeply about the people who made the world a place where we no longer need to live in the darkness and do not have to compete with the wild animals to collect our food."

    "Answer": "My favourite television program is an old series which was produced during the '80s in America. The title of this serial was \"MacGyver\" and it was an action TV series. MacGyver was produced for about 5 consecutive seasons, and it was considered as one of the top-rated TV series in its era.\n\nRCTI was the local television station in Indonesia that broadcasted the programme. The TV series was usually played once a week for about one hour, and I remember that it was played on Friday night at 7.00 pm. So as a teenager during that time, I would have sat in front of the television from 6.45 pm and waited for the programme to start. On the very next day, my friends and I would discuss what had happened in it, how cool and exciting the episode was and how smart and talented Mr MacGyver was.  \n\nThe unique thing about it is that the main character, MacGyver, did not like to use a gun. Instead of using rifles, that we see many heroes do, he used his creativity in creating tools to fight his enemies. I remembered that in one of the episodes, where he was locked by his enemy in a garage, he found some tools, that are used to open the gate of the garage, he escaped from this place.  \n\nI believed I learned some positive things from this series. I learned that we should be encouraged to use our creativity rather than using our physical power and weapons. I believe that MacGyver had influenced so many teenagers during my era and I hope that it would be remade in the future."

    "Answer": "Not sure, how much of an “importance” one should attach to owning a “motorcycle” on a scale of “owning important things”, but I consider my motorcycle to be very important to me because I have always felt like it is a “part of me” since the day I bought it, or “owned” it for hundreds of reasons, seriously.\n\nI have always loved riding a motorcycle since my early childhood, and even wanted to “own” one since then, but my parents didn’t quite feel comfortable with the “adrenaline rush” or a “pre-teen” boy like me. So, I had to wait for at least another 10 years or so before I could actually “own” my “dream” two-wheeled “road warrior”, courtesy to the goodwill of my parents who didn’t hesitate to spend a “handsome” amount of cash to “spoil” their university-going, only “male” child.\n\nAnyway, since then, I have been “driving” (more like “torturing”) my shiny black motorcycle for almost 5 years, without any major complain, in order to travel back and forth from my home to work, visiting my families and friends who are living far away from me, and carrying my younger sisters occasionally to the nearby shopping mall. I also take the help of my “ever-dependable” vehicle to run for different kinds of errands frequently in order to help my family. Finally, if I don’t mention how I drag my “roadster” to take me to a lake, by weathering very “rough” road conditions sometimes, against its will so that I can do some “fishing”, I would not do a complete injustice on my motorcycle.\n\nMy motorcycle is very important to me mainly because of the “versatilities” and flexibilities, it provides, in taking me to different destinations in different kinds of weather conditions. It is important to me also because it saves me a lot in my travel cost, considering how frequently I travel to different places. Finally, the “cool” feeling of walking into a restaurant or an upscale office, with a helmet under my arm while also having a “swagger” at the same time, is just “unbeatable” and “priceless”."

    "Answer": "The desktop computer I own is very important to me. I spend almost 6-7 hours on this computer which is even higher than the time I spend with my friends! My father bought me this computer 3 years ago when I got admitted to the university. I have done some configuration upgrades, but the main parts of the computer have remained almost the same as they were when I purchased it.\n\nI browse the internet on this computer and thus get lots of help related to my studies and assignments. I maintain social networking, update my blogs, play video games, watch movies, listen to music, learn and practice the graphics designing and programming and many more things on this computer. This computer has become an inevitable part of my life and I can hardly think of a day without this computer. The references and helps I get from the internet regarding my studies are unmatched. This saves a lot of time and helps me do better in the exams as well.\n\nThis computer is the main source of information and entertainment for me. I send important emails and check incoming emails which help me do important communications. Every time I am confused about something, I just search it online.  The result is gratifying and it helps me learn more. In short, this is the most necessary tool that I own."

    "Answer": "Holidays come and go in our lives. While some of those holidays feel really “special” to us, the others make us feel really “disappointed”.  However, today, I would like to talk about one such holiday which I would call the “best” one of my life.\n\nIt was about 6 years ago when I was studying in the final year at my university, and things were getting tough as far as the classes and assignment tasks were concerned. Besides, an “unusually” hot summer, “unusual” for the time of the year in my country, made the things even tougher. So, I was desperately looking for a holiday. But, “where would I go” was the first question that came into my mind. However, after giving some thoughts, I finally decided that I would visit one of my cousins, having almost the same age as me, who was living far, far away from my hometown in one of the most beautiful countrysides of my country called (... say the name of a place...) with my loving aunt. So, the next day, I took a non-stop train and arrived at my cousin’s place after travelling for almost 16 hours or so. After arriving there, the first thing, my cousin wanted me to do, was to visit the lake and swim in its crystal clear water to “cool” myself down. The next couple of days, of course, we mostly walked through the meadow while enjoying the mesmerizing beauty of the countryside, followed by bird-hunting and having a picnic in the bush.\n\nIt was arguably the best holiday of my life and so special mainly because it allowed me to enjoy the beautiful nature of my country, while breathing some fresh air also at the same time, which just couldn’t be found at a 5-star luxury hotel in a city, even after costing a “fortune. Besides, sometimes, doing the “simplest” things in life is what really makes us feel happy, when everything else fails, like reuniting with some very special family members, who love you so dearly, or listening to the chirping of some special birds at early dawn without actually ever getting out of your bed."

    "Answer": "The best holiday of my life was the vacation I had with my parents and sisters two years ago. I work in the capital city and visit my hometown 2-3 times a year. My hometown is a 7-hour drive from my current city. That time I got a week’s holiday and planned to surprise my family members. I reached home at around 1.00 am and my parents and siblings were delighted and quite surprised at the same time to see me. They were excited when they heard that I had got a vacation for the whole week. My mother called my elder sister the next day and she came to visit us on the same day with her children.\n\nThe next day we went to watch a movie in the theatre and we ate dinner in a Thai restaurant. We return home late at night and then played cards together. My nephew and niece kept me busy all day long and I spent some exciting time with them.\n\nNext day we went to a nearby picnic spot and that was a very pleasant experience. We cooked our own food and I personally prepared the grilled fish item, which, to our surprise, was delicious. We played outdoor games, ran in the fields and swam in the water. This was a truly great day that I enjoyed thoroughly.\n\nSince my vacation was getting over, my parents planned to visit our grandparents’ (parents of my father) house. Though our grandparents both had passed away a few years ago, we still cherished our time in this very house and enjoyed our stay there. The next morning, we drove to my grandparents' house. It was a bit tough for the car to accommodate all the luggage and us and yet we decided to travel together in a car. We drove for several hours and discussed so many things we have not discussed for a long. It was nostalgic and yet exciting!\n\nIn the evening we reached to our grandparents’ house where two of my uncles and their families live in. Later on, we went to visit the nearby river and enjoyed the open and fresh air. In the evening we returned home and had our family dinner.\n\nOur two days’ stay at my grandparents' house passed very pleasantly and quickly. I returned to our home the next day, and the day after that I returned to my city (where I live and work) by train. This holidays I had with my family is a memorable one, and the best I ever had, as I scarcely get a chance to meet and spend time with all of my family members together whom I love and miss dearly."

    "Answer": "My day starts with a casual walk in the front yard of my house when uncle \"sun\" is just about to start shining with its smiley face. Then starts my routine morning activities including freshening up, taking breakfast and reading some news on the internet to keep myself up to date with what is happening in the world.\n\nOn a typical weekday, I don't really worry too much about my breakfast, but on a weekend, I can be really \"handful\" when it comes to my breakfast, as I want my toasts and omelette to be really fresh and hot as if coming right out of the oven. Anyway, then comes the difficult part of dragging myself out to work since it involves almost an hour of commuting on a day with regular traffics (now you can only imagine how long it would take me to reach my work on a day when the traffic situation is really bad). \n\nIf I reach my work on time, consider that I am lucky since I don't really have to find a \"valid\" reason for the delay. Finally, it is actually time to start working on my tasks which I exactly know what they really are. But, unfortunately, on a typical day, I pretty much spend my time \"helping\" my co-workers from 8 am in the morning to almost 1 pm lunchtime. It is actually after finishing my lunch that I get to work on my own \"scheduled tasks\". I hurry as much as I can to finish the tasks before 6 pm so that I can get out of my office on time, only, of course, to find out that it is almost 7 pm, and I haven't even finished half of my tasks for the day! \n\nThe only \"consolation prize\" for me at the end of a long working day, of course, is I won't get \"admonished\" by my boss the next day for failing to deliver the works on time as he is very much aware of my \"generosity\" to the co-workers. At 7 pm, it is time for me to actually leave the office and finally enjoy my favourite time of the day.\n\nAfter finishing my office works, I don't take a straightaway ride to my home. Instead, I take a little walk (about 10 minutes) to my favourite café, located inside a beautiful garden for the nature lovers like me, for the purpose of unwinding myself with a cup of fresh cappuccino while also smoking my favourite Dunhill international cigarettes occasionally.  I never really spend more than 2 hours at my favourite café, but these two hours allow me an opportunity to think about anything and everything that is not related to my \"works\" and \"money\". Then, after enjoying my favourite part of the day, which pretty much worked like a healthy dose of \"tonic\" for me, when I return to home, I know that I am ready for the next day.  I have been following this \"not-so\" glamorous routine of life for last 5 years or so with nothing really exciting to offer, but, nevertheless, it is a life of some routines, and I don't really have much to complain about it."

I spend my days mostly adhering to this routine except for Sundays when I do not follow a specific routine.\n\nI get up early in the morning, mostly at around 6:30 am and take a shower. A hot-refreshing shower makes me ready to take the challenges of the day! I eat my breakfast and then get ready for university. I reach my university roughly at 8:30 am and attend the classes till 3:00 pm. I eat my lunch at around 1:00 pm from the university cafeteria. I usually spend some time with my classmates after classes and return home at around 4:30 pm. I take some rest and go to nearby fields in the evening. I walk for an hour and return home at 6:30 pm. Sometimes I play football with my friends.\n\nIn the evening, I eat some light snacks and then concentrate on my studies. I usually read till 9:00 pm and then spend a few minutes browsing the internet. I usually browse the internet for about 1-2 hours a day. I eat my supper at 11:00 pm and then read for another hour. Before I go to bed I brush my teeth and read a novel. I read the novel for around 40 minutes to 1:30 hours and then fall asleep.\n\nI have been following this routine for the last 3 years. If I do not have classes or if I have holidays, I go through a different routine which includes watching movies, playing computer games, hanging out with friends etc.\n\nI enjoy the morning shower, evening walks and my classes very much among the activities in a day of my life. Sometimes, playing football with my friends is thoroughly exciting and entertaining."

    "Answer": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa, also known as Tower of Pisa, is an impressive structure situated in the Pisa city in Italy.  It is the third oldest structure in Pisa's Cathedral Square and very famous for its unintended tilt to one side.\n\nThe height of the tower is around 183 feet and the width is higher in the lower part than the top part. This tower has 296 steps and offers a great architectural value to the world. The tilt of this tower was not planned and occurred unintentionally. During the construction phase, the slope was created because of the inadequate foundation on the soft ground. Later this slope increased until the structure was stabilised. Around 200 years were taken to build this greatest structure. There are some debates about the real architect of this world-famous structure and it has been credited to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano as the architects of this structure. But recent studies imply this credit to Diotisalvi as the original architect.\n\nThis structure has innumerable historic significance and was one of the seven medieval wonders of the world. The people of Pisa started building this structure to show the rest of the world about the importance of the Pisa city. The plan included a cathedral, a baptistery, a bell tower and a cemetery. The construction began at around 1173 AD and completed in the middle of 1300 AD. This famous tower is not known only for the great beauty of its Romanesque architecture but also for its historical significance. The famous astronomer Galileo Galilei is said to have dropped a cannonball and a musket ball bot at a time from the Tower of Pisa to prove that weight does not affect the dropping speed of an object.\n\nThis structure is one of mankind's greatest achievements and architectural works and should be preserved as part of our heritage and past. \n\nThis structure was listed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 and had been very famous as one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. I had been fortunate enough to look at this marvellous structure a few years ago and it is one of the most profounding architectural feats in my opinion."

    "Answer": "Often being considered as the \"8th wonder of the ancient world\", the Pantheon in Rome is a true architectural wonder still to this date. Having been shrouded in mysteries as to when the structure was really built, many historians suggest that the temple, once dedicated to all the gods of pagan Rome, was built and dedicated between 118 -125 A.D.\n \nThe pantheon's basic design is simple and yet, very powerful and fascinating as far as its architecture is concerned. The basic and fundamental structure of the temple is made of a series of intersecting arches. The arches rest on eight piers (a platform of pillars) which then support another eight, round-headed arches that stretch through the drum from its inner face to the outer face. If approaching the Pantheon from the outside, it would appear rectangular in shape. But, in reality, it is only the first small room (called \"cella\") that actually has corners. However, the rotunda itself is completely round. When it came to building the dome of the pantheon, the Romans also knew perfectly well how to use arches to help carry the weight of their huge building structures by using lighter materials at the top of the dome while using heavier materials at the bottom. But the lightest of the materials were reserved for the ceiling of the dome. Interestingly enough, the Romans used bricks to build the dome. Lastly, but not in the least, built with costly wooden scaffolding, the detail of the pantheon is simply outstanding.\n \nThis great architectural wonder should be preserved as visiting the Roman pantheon today would almost be like transporting back to the Roman Empire itself. As architects from all over Europe and America from the Renaissance through the 19th century studied it and incorporated what their findings into their own works, later on, the pantheon has remained as one of the most imitated buildings in history. The pantheon is probably is the best-preserved of all Roman buildings which had been dedicated as a Christian church to Mary and the Martyr Saints in 609 A.D. Being used as a tomb also, this Christian temple also carries the memories of painter Raphael, the first two kings, and first queen of Italy, the pantheon today exists for all the people being a house of \"worship\" for all religions in the west."

    "Answer": "The first television, as we see it today, was first invented by a young guy called Philo Taylor Farnsworth in 1927. But, little did the young American inventor, still, in his very early 20's, know that his first \"electronic television\" would change the trajectory of the world of showbiz and news in such dramatic fashion. Today, with more than 1.4 billions of households (out of 1.9 billions of them) in the world, including me, own at least one TV set, it is fair to conclude that TV still today arguably is the most popular electronic media for the mainstream viewers including me.\n \nAnyway, I don't know about others, but I like my television more than a radio or internet simply because I have been watching it since the day I began to understand the world around me, and also because I am just a bit too much traditional to let go of it just yet.  But, to be more precise, I like my TV because it provides me with an escape from the hustle and bustle of a busy life when I need it the most. Whether I want to watch or listen to some news or just need to unwind myself by watching a good game, I know that my TV won't disappoint me. \n \nThen, of course, when I am in a \"serious\" mood to learn something important, I just know that I can rely upon my \"audio and video\" box in order to watch some of my favourite documentary shows on the \"discovery\" or \"history\" channel. Finally, I seldom have to worry about hitting a movie theatre in order to watch a good movie simply because I know that I will be able to watch it on my cable TV one day, sooner or later. \n \nTelevision can be many things to many people, but the biggest advantage of having a TV is that this particular electronic media has the ability to unite millions of us around a common cause and interest by offering us a verified and trusted source/platform for news, cultures, sports and entertainment. A good TV program can also improve our world views, encourages proper education and understanding, elevates our curiosity and triggers our imagination. \n \nBut, that doesn't mean that television is without its fair share of criticism as watching too much television by remaining indoors can detach us from the realities of the outside world. Besides, the study suggests that excessive TV watching (more than 3 hours a day) can cause sleep difficulties, lower grades (in children) and behavioural problems. People, who watch too much TV, are socially inept, due to the lack of enough social interaction, as well as obese due to the inability to burn the excess calorie intake in their bodies. Finally, there are just too much vulgarity and illicit content on some channels which can have some dire consequences on young children.\n \nHaving said that, if we use it for good, it can be a marvellous electronic media for the whole family."

    "Answer": "My favourite electronic media is television, and I guess this is the most popular electronic media in the world. With the popularity of the satellite channels and diversity of the programmes offered by different channels, people have started accepting TV as a mean to enjoy their time. \n\nWith the satellite network connection watching even more than 500 channels cost a very little per month in my country. A large number of TV channels offer information, news, entertainment, an insight into an event, weather reports, live shows and so on. People can spend hours after hours watching TV programmes which are thoroughly entertaining and educative. People heavily rely on their television for latest and international news. The audio-visual representation of news and information on TV are easier to grasp than that of other media. \n\nWhat do I do with this electronic media? Well, I watch the news, documentaries, movies and music shows on TV. Many TV channels offer specialised programmes for people and among them, I find National Geographic, Discovery and the BBC very reliable and authentic source of information. As we have a smart TV at our house, I often connect to the Internet and watch my favourite videos on YouTube or use an application like Skype to talk to a friend. With a smart TV, the possibility is virtually limitless.   \n\nThe television is the primary source of news, information and entertainment for many around the world and TV channels are constantly working to educate people and let them know the local and international events. One can easily watch a TV programme while doing other tasks. This is quite impossible for other media like the print media. The variation of programmes is helpful for people to easily pick one’s favourite channels. We can watch live events and news on TV and with the advancement of technology, it has become easier for everyone to own a TV at home.\n\nThe main drawback of this media is that people become addicted to TV programmes and thus often stay indoors rather than going out and socialise. On top of that, politically biased news sometimes misleads people and causes unavoidable conflicts. Overwatching television has health-related issues and specifically harms children who watch TV programmes for long hours. Apart from that, international TV channels are often thought to be the reason for the cultural degradation of youths."

    "Answer": "Being a student of science, I have always wondered what would have happened if \"Physics\" as a faculty of science didn't exist. Well, one thing for sure is that we wouldn't have got the theory of relativity and Gravity, to name only two out of many, which have practically changed our views of the world as well as our \"lives\" itself. But, as I took my educational journey to a university and got the opportunity to learn \"the subject\" of Einstein and Newton in more details, I didn't really need to wonder anymore. \n \nI liked physics during my student life probably more than any other subjects. I liked it not only because I was good at it, but also because of my fond memories and experiences of this subject. Spending many, many hours of learning fundamental theories of physics in the classrooms together with even more hours at a physics lab, I have learnt to understand that physics probably and potentially is the most satisfying of all the main science subjects as this difficult subject tends to explain why and how things happen in this material world. Having learnt about circular motion, waves, gravity, energy, force, electricity and much more, as a student, I could certainly feel myself as being little \"smarter\" than others, who were not the students of \"science\".  Whether I was experimenting with Newton's \"law of motion\" or \"law of gravitation\" in a lab, I always felt like I was a \"scientist\" in my own little lab.\n \nI enjoyed learning this interesting subject mainly because I could actually engage myself on an intellectual level with not only the teachers but also with my fellow students. Besides, in a physics class, more often than not, I would be one of the few lucky students to be requested to the class board in order to explain some of the difficult topics of physics whether they were related to the laws of thermodynamics or quantum physics. And I loved being challenged by a very interesting branch of science that represented a complete purity of thoughts without having to worry about any religion, politics, human psychology or any other ambiguous human variables for that matter."

    "Answer": "History was my favourite subject in my academic life. I have learned so many things from history books and started realising how important it is for us to know our past to build the future. I learned a lot from my history teachers and they were excellent tutors who always motivates us. I was so fascinated about my experience of reading and learning the history that it was my major in my university.\n\nLearning about the past is something that gives us essential knowledge about our country, heritage, the world we live in and about the human race as a whole. It also warns us about past catastrophic events and motivates us to build a better world. I took history seriously for the first time when I was in grade 7 and I found it intriguing. I learned about the ancient world, how the social and economic conditions were then and how the world has been shaped by the different events throughout the time. I liked it more than any other subject in my school. I could actually relate things I learned from my history textbooks, and this was not the case for a few other subjects that we were taught at that time. So I really liked history as a subject. I developed an uncanny attraction towards it and tried to read as many history books as possible back then. \n\nAfter that, I become so interested in this subject that I started reading books on History by different writers. There is a famous saying that \"To shape the future you must know the past\", and history teaches us that. I had been lucky to have some great teachers who have a tremendous way of explaining the topics of history. To me, other subjects like literature and math were also interesting but I felt a different passion for history as a subject.\n\nAfter I finished school, I took history as my major and that has greatly influenced me the way I look at the world and to the past and the future. Reading and learning history was like travelling through time and generations and that excited me so much. To be honest it still does. I fell in love with this subject and it became my favourite subject soon."

    "Answer": "This is indeed a great topic to talk about and the credit goes to you for allowing me the time to think and talk about it. \n\nMath has always been my favourite subject in my school days and my interest in math helped me profoundly to understand other science-related subjects more accurately. I have recently graduated from computer science and I could not have been a good programmer without my understanding and love for mathematics. Academic subjects like statistics, algorithm, data structure and programming are hard to learn without someone's command in mathematics.\n\nI liked mathematics because I was good at it! My father is an architect and I have always felt curious about his passion for mathematics and architectural design. In my academic years, I was not a top scorer, but my grades in maths were always high. I remember spending more hours solving mathematical problems than memorising poems and reading literature. Thus when I was in high school, I was good at maths and it's natural that I spent more time doing maths than other subjects.\n\nMy father has a great influence in developing my interests for maths. He painstakingly explained mathematical formulas, their usage and practical implications to me and thus I started loving this subject from my early childhood. I was lucky to have some great teachers during my academic years who also were my motivation to do well in mathematics.  \n\nI could solve mathematics as I had a solid foundation in it from my childhood. I was often asked by my class teachers to explain a certain math problem to them. This also grew my confidence and in high school, I was persuaded that I can solve any math problems from our textbooks. As you know, young people often like the subject they are good at and spend more time reading and understanding it. This was also the case for me and math has always been my favourite subject in my academic years."

But, as for me, I have always loved it when my father moved to another place. In fact, I actually used to get bored of a place if my father lived there for more than a couple of years. Having seen my interest in travelling to different places, my father once joked with me saying that I should become a \"Travel and Tour Guide\" when I grow up. And, interestingly enough, I actually liked what my father told me then. But little did I know at that time that I would actually fulfil the \"wish\" of my father after 16 years by becoming a Travel and Tour Guide. \n\nWell, what can I say? I just love to see what this beautiful world has in store for us, and I just don't think that there is a better way to do it than choosing a career path which pays us to do the things that we actually love! After all, how many people can resist a job which involves guiding a group of cool and curious people to see the fantastic places in this world?  \n\nI am probably one of those few lucky people in this world who has a job that always keeps him interested in his next assignment or task. And it means that when I get to stand up in front of a group of new people from a different land/country every once in a while and empower them with the coolest information about a prospective tourist spot or attraction, I know that I have earned their faith. But, I think, the best and the most rewarding part of my job is when I also get to become just like another tourist with my tourist companions in order to encourage them to view the \"treasures\" of this world through their own eyes instead of how I present them.\n\nThen, of course, trying to have a little \"chit-chat\" with them by \"butchering\" their languages (despite my best efforts) during the tours is no less rewarding either, given how they wish sometimes that their tour guides would speak in their languages instead of English. Finally, after a day-long tour of sight-seeing and enjoying very good local cuisines at a very affordable price, when I see my \"tourist cohorts\" admiring me in smiles and getting ready for the next day \"adventure\", I know that I deserve the satisfaction of a job well done."

    "Answer": "I have recently finished my graduation from university and my major was computer science. I would like to work as a software developer (more commonly known as 'programmer') in a reputed software company and that's the career I want to have. I have learned a few programming languages, web and database applications and hope to work as a junior programmer for approximately two to three years. I hope I would be able to become a skilled programmer after a few years.\n\nThe job of a programmer involves understanding how software and database are designed, writing codes and then debugging them to make the required software or web applications. For that, a programmer needs good code-writing experience and understand the requirement of the software. From a retail shop to the nuclear research centre, everywhere computer software is used and I want to work for a company that makes software for large-scale clients. The programmer has to make sure that the software runs without any glitches and it is time and cost-efficient. They also need to be a good team member as a large-scale software is developed by a team of people rather than an individual programmer.\n\nI chose it mostly because of my educational background and personal interest. Since I have studied in computer science, naturally I would want to work on something that relates to my education and skills. Secondly, I have a passion for writing software codes. I have already developed some small utility tools and web-based software and learning software development methodologies. Now I want to create some larger-scale software, or at least be a part of the team, that would help me gain valuable experiences to enhance my career in the future. \n\nI believe someone should work in an industry that relates to his/ her skillset and synchronises to his/her interests. The software programmer's job perfectly suits my enthusiasms and academic study. Furthermore, the prospect of this job is very high and a good programmer earns more than employees of many other industries.

    "Answer": "No doubt that the internet is one of the greatest inventions, if not the greatest, of all time which has certainly changed our world for good. In fact, the possibilities of the internet are simply endless, if used properly, as there are so many important benefits of using it, no matter what we do and which part of the world we live in.\n\nTo begin with, one of the most important benefits of the internet is that it allows us to connect and communicate, by supplying an endless amount of knowledge and information, with each other in an instant manner which was unimaginable before its invention about several decades ago. In fact, in the past, it would take days, and sometimes even months, to receive a letter from someone else. But, today, with the internet, we can send an email (electronic mail) or even “instant messages” to anyone in the world and have it delivered, along with loads of information, in seconds!\n\nAnyway, while different people prefer internet for different reasons, I prefer it because it allows me to chat with my friends and families instantly, with the help of social media and different chat messengers, while also see them live no matter where I live. Students can also take advantage of such benefit, provided by the internet, by researching for different kinds of data and information on the world wide web which would ultimately help them to prepare important research papers and other important documents from the comfort of their homes without ever visiting a library.\n\nAnyway, the introduction of the internet has proved out to be very important for my country on several grounds. First, it has improved the efficiency and productivity of our workers at factories and offices by accelerating the process of sharing different kinds of data and information rather easily and quickly. Besides, it has also enabled millions of our young workers to search for different kinds of “online works” in different countries and companies and thus helping eliminate the unemployment problem of my country rather significantly."

    "Answer": "Computers and the internet are comparatively new inventions and yet they have revolutionised the way we lead our life. The internet is used everywhere and this has changed the way we communicate, teach, learn, do business, purchase a product, and what not!\n\nThe internet has brought countless benefits for us and in my opinion, the ease of communication is the most important one. The old way of communication via postal mails, telephones and travelling were expensive and time-consuming. But the internet has made it possible to communicate with others, be it a personal communication or business communication, remarkably easy. Someone can send an email with rich media like video, image and multimedia presentation to anyone in the world instantaneously. The widespread popularity of social media networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have made it possible for us to get connected with friends, family members, colleagues, make new friends, and this list goes on.\n\nWith the internet, people can do business conference from different parts of the worlds and it has improved the way companies run their businesses. The internet reminds us of our friends’ and family members’ birthdays and other important events and thus this technology helps us become more proactive and social.\n\nI prefer to use the internet for several reasons. First, it is easily accessible and cheap. I can use the internet at home, at the office and even when I travel. I can get help on any topics from the internet, can find a location on Google Maps and get directions while I drive. It helps me get connected to my family members, relatives and friends. I do online shopping and that helps me to save significant time. The internet is probably the richest knowledge hub that can answer my questions. This is a great medium for entertainment for me as I can find any music, movie or TV serial I like to watch.\n\nThe internet, as I have already said, is the most opulent source of information. Students can easily take advantage of it and enhance their knowledge. In fact, many students already use the internet as their study references and they complete their assignments with the help of it. Reading books online is another great way to enhance knowledge for young pupils.\n\nOur country has a high potential for the development of the IT sector and a large number of companies are working in this sector already. This promising sector heavily depends on the internet. Besides, the eCommerce is primarily dependent on this technology. There is scarcely any office or business in my country that can run without the internet. Thus our economy has a significant dependence on this technology."

    "Answer": "The internet is the most extraordinary thing! I am old enough to remember a time before even computers existed, let alone the internet. It has brought about many benefits, and today and I’m going to focus on the one I think is most important. I’ll tell you what it is, why I have chosen it and how it has helped me and could help students too before finishing with trying to articulate just why it is so important in my country, the UK.\n\nThe internet is an almost infinite resource. We can use it to find information on any topic – although just because it appears on a page online somewhere doesn’t mean the information or advice is necessarily true or wise! For me, the real benefit of the internet is the way it puts people in touch across the world, communication and connectivity. Not only through instantaneous messages whizzing across the ether to people thousands of miles away that you already know via email, but more extraordinarily through putting people in touch with like-minded strangers.\n\nWhen travelling this year, for the first time I kept a blog. I was astonished. I had a ‘comment’ feature on the site, and people from all over the world got in touch with me to give advice, offer feedback on what I’d seen and said and share their own experiences of travelling and working overseas. It was inspirational. I thought travelling on my own would be scary and maybe lonely at times, instead, I found that there was a whole international community of well-meaning, like-minded people who were happy to travel along with me – albeit virtually, and laugh with me at the highs and support me through more challenging aspects. It really opened my eyes to the possibilities of building new international friendships with people who had encountered my blog pretty randomly. It was fantastic to access this group of people, learn from them and enjoy their contributions. It made me much more confident in my adventures, I felt like I wasn’t alone.\n\nThe internet sometimes gets a bad press in terms of the dangers of social media and the need to be cautious about who you meet online. That is probably true in some instances. However, my experience was wholly positive. I felt that these friends from afar that I have only ever met online, provide proof positive that there are more kind and helpful people in the world than not. The internet facilitates that for everyone who can access a cyber café or the internet signal wherever they are in the world.\n\nStudents - like everyone else – can exploit this. Whether that’s by carrying out original research from talking to someone active in an online forum about a particular topic, accessing an expert opinion from a specialist blog or from getting in touch with fellow students to offer each other peer support around difficult subjects. The internet is at its best when, rather than being used for passive searching for information, it is used to actively engage with other users. Discussion, debate, sharing experiences, all have value.\n\nFor my country, the UK, the internet has revolutionised the way people connect with one another. We have come a very long way from the times when sending a letter could take weeks by sea or many days by air. The only other alternative being to make a ruinously expensive phone call and keeping your fingers crossed that your intended contact would be in when you called. As for reaching out to a complete stranger ‘someone somewhere’  – I think the nearest equivalent pre the internet might have been to write a letter, put it in a bottle and cast it into the sea! Times have certainly changed!"

    "Answer": "In the past, I have become a “member” of different clubs, but it never occurred to me that I would also need to be a “club organizer” at a small town because nobody there really cared to understand the “importance” of having a club for whatever reasons that might be.\n\nIt was about 10 years ago when my father was transferred to a small town in my country because of professional reasons. By the way, it was indeed a very small town (more like a “countryside”), with only a few thousand of people living there, which had nothing except a few “streets”, a dozen of different kinds of shops/outlets, and a few large office buildings. The town luckily also had a “junior” college, which I attended for a couple of years, as long as I lived there. But, what really bothered me that the town didn’t exactly have any facilities for “recreation” or “cultural activities”. So, I took upon the challenge myself to organize a local “sports club” for young people.  \n\nBut, it wasn’t really easy because nobody initially wanted to cooperate with me to find a suitable location for the club and the funds to run it. So, I decided to talk to the “local city counselor” and sought for his help. And, it worked like “magic” as soon, we didn’t just get a “sports club” but also at least a dozen of enthusiastic college student members. I didn’t just stop at “organizing” the sports club, but I also actively took part in different kinds of social/cultural activities, such as a musical concert or organizing a monthly picnic.\n\nThe club was important to me because it allowed me to connect with the local residents there at a social level. Besides, it also allowed me to remain fit and healthy, both mentally and physically, by taking part in different kinds of physical, social and cultural activities, organized by the sports club. Finally, it also taught me great people/communication skills and team-building skills which later proved out to be very helpful to build a stronger resume/CV for a better career opportunity."

    "Answer": "Besides my study, I am an active member of the \"Youth Knowledge Club\" in my locality and I do actively participate in different programmes they organise. I would like to thank you for allowing me the time to talk about it.\n \nThis is basically a club that encourages people to read books. It also actively take part in various 'social welfare' related activities. The members pay only a small amount of fees and the rest of the money comes from a large NGO. The members attend the club every Sunday, from 10.00 am to 12.30 pm, and discuss different social, environmental and personal issues. Some cultural activities are also held on and these are mainly conducted by us. The members of our club enjoy the advantage of taking books to home, and they also contribute to the betterment of the local youths, their education, and moreover, social and cultural aspects in our locality.\n \nI am a member of this club for the last 5 years and because of that, I have access to a very rich library they have. I bring books home every week and because of my involvement with the club, I have been able to read books by many writers. This has definitely helped me learn new things and enhance my knowledge. Apart from that, I take part in some cultural and social activities they organise which I find interesting and exciting. In several occasions, we have distributed books to poor children for free, stood beside victims of natural disasters and cleaned the locality. I had been able to be a part of many noble works because of my active participation with this club.\n \nMost of us want to help people who are in need but sometimes it is not possible to reach them alone. Being involved in a club that mainly focuses on aid for people is a great way of helping others. That's why my involvement with this club is very important to me."

    "Answer": "When I was in high school, I organised a club with some of my friends and neighbours. As I recall, we named it as NAVIGATOR. We organised this club with the aim to collect donations for the flood/cyclone/earthquake victims in our country. This was actually aimed to help people and the club was a charitable organisation. Apart from that, we established a night school for the street children and a library for the club members as part of this club.\n \nI was actually a founding member of the club and we had to work hard for a long to establish the club. Making it a helpful organisation for the people took a great deal of effort. To my surprise, this club and its activities were reported very positively in a local newspaper. I did so many things back then including donation collection, member authorization, teaching at the night school, conducting meetings and so on. I extremely enjoyed being a part of a noble cause. Though I am no longer an active member of this club, I still feel very passionately about it. It's so great to see that something that was my brainchild has grown considerably. \n \nIt's a club where I got involved in from the very beginning of its inception. Over time, it became actually a part of my life. This club gave me the opportunity to do something good for the poor and suffering people. I felt great by contributing to this noble cause and this club brought me this opportunity."

    "Answer": "Today, it is almost impossible to live in a world without the internet, no matter where we live and what we do. People, who are offering internet services and facilities as their profession, also understand this and that’s why they also open cyber café in different places and localities. Today, I would like to talk about one such cyber café in my locality.\n\nThe cyber café is located inside a rather large shopping complex, which houses many other different kinds of shops, at a major city intersection. The good thing about this internet café is that it can be seen rather easily from outside. With a size of about 1000 square feet, the cyber café is well decorated with enough furniture, computers and other office equipment like printer, copier, and fax machine. The café also has a very nice lighting system to help everything see very clearly.\n\nThe computers are kept in a cubicle like space in order to ensure enough privacy for the users. Offering a full air condition facility, the cyber café is a great layout, with all the users sitting close to the walls while the café staffs sitting in the middle so that the staffs can monitor every user and meet their needs when required.\n\nLike any other cyber cafe, users here can surf the internet in order to search for some information, read or send emails, watch their favourite videos online, or just read some news. The cyber café also offers its visitors the opportunity to have a voice chat with others and making video calls also to see each other on camera. Besides, the internet users there can also get print out or photocopies of the important documents. By the way, it is a paid café as in it charges customers for using internet service on an hourly basis.\n\nAnyway, it is an important place for people in my locality because it allows people to use the internet who don’t have any access to a computer or the internet at home, or allows users to print important documents who don't have printers at their home. Besides, it also allows our community members to share their views with each other, which is not possible otherwise, on an array of issues that affect our locality in general."

    "Answer": "With the ever-increasing popularity of the internet and people's dependency on it for various reasons, the need for cyber cafes or internet cafes has grown tremendously. As a result, cyber cafes can often be seen in different places in our city. To meet the rapidly increasing demands of internet use, emails and printing documents, people nowadays visit the nearby cyber cafes now and then. Those who have a personal computer and the internet connection usually use the internet at home but other people go to those internet cafes that offer a cheap rate for browsing internet, printing, and making video calls. One such internet cafe in our locality where I often go to is \"Express Cyber Zone\".\n\nThis internet cafe is only a few minutes away from my home and it offers a good service. Their computers have the latest configuration and they offer a high-speed internet connection. The speed is 5 Mbps and users who are ready to pay a bit more can use even faster internet which is 10 Mbps. The decoration, environment, sitting arrangement, privacy option and behaviour of the cafe staffs are good and that's why they have many regular customers. For regular users, they offer a discount and they also have monthly membership facility. The computers have IPS backup and per hour browsing rate is competitive. For these reasons, I mainly go to this cafe apart from using the internet at my home. If I need some bulk printing, I go to that cafe and they offer professional service for printing needs.\n\nBesides the internet browsing facility, they also offer printing, scanning, computer servicing, and DVDs.  Fast food, tea, coffee are also available and interestingly they have a dedicated kitchen to serve the customers. People mostly go there to use the internet and this place offers a high-speed internet connection and also offers a nice environment for internet browsing."

    "Answer": "Thank you for this cue card topic because it allows me to describe a place where I spend a significant amount of time as a student, learning about many things. I am talking about my favourite library.\n\nThe name of this library is “Central Library” at Indian Institute of Technology, which is located in the city of Chennai (formerly known as “Madras”) of Tamil Nadu. I visited this library and studied there for about 5 years when I was studying Engineering.\n\nIt has around 2 million books covering all disciplines of science, engineering, technology, humanities & social sciences. The collection comprises printed documents such as books, reports, theses, standards, atlases, patents and journal back volumes. Being very well equipped with modern facilities and resources, the library also has non-book collections, including microfiche/film, audio/video cassettes and CD ROM discs. It has a separate collection of prescribed textbooks under 'Book Bank' for the exclusive use of students.  \n\nBesides, it also has a website which provides to its students the electronic access to various full text & bibliographical databases & e-journals.  The library is a large 5-storey building, and it has nice layout and architecture where a very large number of students can accommodate themselves in their own privacy.\n\nAnyway, as a post-graduate student, I visit this library in order to study and research. I also use computers at this library in order to read some news and chat with my friends online when I get tired of studying. This great library benefits me and all other students by allowing us access to all kinds of important information on a rather quick notice which otherwise wouldn’t be possible.\n\nAnyway, it is my favourite library because I really like the nice, quiet and clean environment there, where I am not only able to gain important knowledge, but also able to relax by studying all kinds of interesting materials. Besides, it also allows me to share views and exchange information with my friends and fellow students on important study-related information which help me in a great deal academically."

    "Answer": "The \"City Central Library\" in my town is my favourite library. This is a library that is run and funded by the local council and is a renowned library in our town. This library is more than 100 years old and has a very rich collection of books, journals, reference books, novels and other reading materials. The authority has recently introduced some digital book searching and reading facilities, which I believe is a great initiative. Almost 200 people go to this library every day and it offers a quiet and calm environment for readers, exactly the environment a bookworm would expect.\n\nThis library offers many benefits for us. The most important thing is about a library is that it comprises books that are the main source of knowledge and wisdom. This library has more than 20,000 books and people can easily find a book that might interest them or the books they were looking for. Students come here to take reference for their assignments; some readers come to read novels and stories by world-renowned writers and some locals come here to read newspapers and magazines. The regular members can borrow books to home and thus can read in their free time. Time spent in a library is a wise investment and I feel that the contribution of this library towards making an informed and conscious generation is unmatched.\n\nI often go to the library to read books that are in my \"must-read\" list. Besides, this is a good place to take notes and to read. And I often go there for my study purpose. As I am a member of this library, I can borrow books and I usually return those books in every 4-5 days to borrow a new one.\n\nWe have many famous libraries in our country that I heard about and yet this is the very library that helped me grow my interest in an extra-curricular habit -which is reading books for pleasure and not for academic purposes only. I have read books from this library that have greatly helped me and because of that, I like this library more than any other library in the world. Furthermore, the environment for reading a book there, the friendly staff, the arrangement of books, the rich collection, and my easy access to this library make it my favourite library."

    "Answer": "I loved to read different kinds of books when I was growing up as a child. In fact, every time, there was a new children’s book in the market, I would have to get my hands on it. Of course, I didn’t really care to remember about those books, after reading them, that much except for a few books. Today, I would like to talk about one such book.\n\nThe name of this book was named “Charlotte’s Web”.  The book, written by E.B. White and published in 1952, was considered to be White's most famous novel. In fact, it's sold more than 45 million copies since its first publication and had been translated into 23 languages. Eventually, the book had made its way into several film adaptations as well. In 1970, the novel earned White the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal, one of the highest honours in children's literature.\n\nAnyway, the novel tells the story of a livestock pig named Wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named Charlotte. When Wilbur is in danger of being slaughtered by the farmer, Charlotte writes messages praising Wilbur (such as \"Some Pig\") in her web in order to persuade the farmer to let him live.  At the end of the story, while Wilbur gets to be very famous at a country fair with the help of Charlotte message writing skills, Charlotte herself reaches the end of her life after laying an egg sack. But before dying, Charlotte entrusts her eggs to Wilbur who takes them back to the barn, guarding them until they hatch. However, while most of the newly-born spiders leave Wilbur, three of them stay behind and befriend Wilbur, who lives a long and happy life surrounded by Charlotte's descendants. \n\nAnyway, it is my favourite book from my childhood because the characters and descriptions of farm life in the book looked so surreal to my little mind. Besides, no other books, which I had read up until then, had awakened my imagination to give me a heavy heart as the anatomy and sad demise of a spider’s life, called “Charlotte”, in that timeless classic."

    "Answer": "‘The Diary of a Young Girl’ which is also known as ‘The Diary of Anne Frank’, was one of my most favourite books in my childhood. I was so touched by this book and enjoyed it so much that I read it 2-3 times. This book was published from a diary written by a young girl named Anne Frank. My father gave this book as my 11th birthday gift and I read it when I was 11 years old. I have even read it when I grew up and was a student at the college. To my surprise, the book was as appealing and touchy as I found it in my childhood.\n\nThe book was adapted from the diary Anne Frank, who was a teenage girl around 13 years old at the time of writing her diary. She originally wrote in Dutch language and later this book was translated into more than 60 languages worldwide. She wrote the diary when she and her family were in hiding for two years during the Nazi occupation of the Netherland during the Second World War.\n\nAnne got a diary as a birthday gift when she turned to 13 and she began to write in it from 14th June 1942. At that time, the Nazi invaded the Netherland and they were in hiding into a sealed-off upper room of Anne’s father’s office building in Amsterdam. They remain hiding there for two years and Anne wrote the events of the people living there, her personal thoughts and what happened at that time.\n\nShe has a good relationship with her father and a poor relationship with her mother. She admired her sister’s talent and intelligence and calm nature. She was initially irritated about Peter, a boy of her own age and later on they two became very close. Thus a little girl wrote about the relationship, people’s mentality, perceptions of human, little joys and sadness of life and revealed the suffering of the people due to the war.\n\nAnne dies when she became 15 years old after they were betrayed and found by the Nazi. Sadly she dies only 2 weeks before the British troops liberated the prisoners from the concentration camp. After her death, the diary was bit censored and was published with her father’s permission who was the only survivor from the Nazi camp.\n\nThe suffering of the people during the war, the feelings and thoughts of a young girl, her complaints and happiness, her perception of life were so brilliant that it touched my heart. I could not leave the book until I finished it and I was deeply touched to read the thoughts of a young and brilliant girl who was killed at her 15."

It was the time of the annual sporting event, and I took part in a friendly volleyball match.\n\nBy the way, volleyball was the only sport that I enjoyed playing back then. However, needless to say, I wasn’t really very good at playing volleyball even though I enjoyed playing it a lot. So, I started to do little practising and jogging early in the morning to increase my fitness level.\n\nAnyway, the game started between the two teams which included both the senior and junior students of my school in both the teams. The first 4 sets of the game were drawn, but the final set was really competitive as both teams tried their best to score points. I also tried my best to return the ball over the net, when it had come on my way, but unfortunately, I had failed to return the ball on a few occasions. As a result, my opponent team had a little edge over my team. The game had continued like this for some more time, with everybody trying to hit and punch the ball over the net on the opposite side of the court, and I was getting tired.  Suddenly, another \"serve\" came on our way, which, we thought, was going to fall outside of the court, but my whole team was proved wrong. Little later, my opponent team was declared the winner.  \n\nAnyway, I felt really great about the completion, even though I was on the losing side because it made me feel competitive. I also felt really good, when my fellow team members were cheering me and encouraging me to play well because it made me really confident about my ability."

    "Answer": "Ooh, it’s quite hard for me to think about an example of a competition I’ve entered as generally speaking I am not a very competitive individual! However, I can think of one competition that I entered, which I think you will find funny. I’m going to tell you what I had to do, what the competition was for including the prize, and what happened after I entered.\n\nMany years ago I used to live in a town called Leamington Spa. One of the few independent shops in the town was a large old-fashioned department store which sold quite traditional items like haberdashery products for sewing and knitting and gentlemen’s gloves and handkerchiefs. Over time, they decided they needed to extend their product range to attract new customers, so they held a competition in a weekly local newspaper. The competition was very easy to enter, you simply had to complete your name and address on the coupon and post it into the newspaper offices of the Leamington Courier. The prize was to be a specially fitted lingerie set, as a way of launching their new selection of ladies underwear!\n\nI never win competitions, or I thought I never did. So I was amazed when a couple of weeks after posting my entry I received a letter telling me that I was one of three lucky winners! I was instructed to come to the store for a fitting and informed that ‘a photographer from the local paper would be on hand to photograph the winners afterwards!’ It was very funny, the letter was badly written, and it made it sound as if we would be expected to pose in our winning underwear and agree to be pictured in the local news! I duly went along to the store, where the comedy continued. Although the brassiere range was supposed to be suitable for women of all shapes and sized, in fact, none of the three of us who had won could be correctly fitted into the bras available. Embarrassed, the manager of the store offered us alternative products, and the photographer from the paper said he still wanted a shot of all the winners with an appropriate background. After some discussion, he got us to peer into a brochure, as if choosing a glamorous underwear set, whilst behind us were rails and rails of lingerie. The lingerie department wasn’t very big, and nor was it well lit. Our photographer was unfortunately rather generously proportioned and he struggled to move his 'ample frae' between the rails of clothes to get the right camera angle. Eventually, he stepped back without looking properly, and as he did so knocked over some rails of bras and knickers and ended up in a tangled heap of coat hangers, fallen rails and covered in a selection of compromising underwear. I hadn’t laughed so much in years!\n\nSo how do I feel about the competition? Well, I was amazed to win something, and I did end up with quite a nice new set of underwear for very little effort, but most importantly of all, I had a really hilarious day collecting my prize and I hope you will agree I got a good anecdote out of it too!"

One such contest that I would like to talk about was the Cycling competition that I participated in my college.\n\nI was then a student at the college and around 15 years old. One day I noticed an advertisement in our local newspaper that an inter-college cycling competition would be held on next week. The entry fee would be $20 and the prizes would be given to the first three cyclists. I had a passion for cycling and I that’s why I thought to participate it.\n\nOn the day of the contest, I went to the starting point and registered my name in the competition. I took my bicycle and wore my cycling dresses. I noticed there were around 30 competitors and I was asked to stand at my start point. With the sound of the whistle, I start cycling. I had almost no intention of winning prized but I simply did concentrate on cycling. The total distance was around 5 miles and that required some energy and time. After I finished racing, I was really surprised to hear that I won the third prize. I found that some of my classmates were shouting because I was one of the three prize winners.\n\nI felt really happy and proud that I did well in this competition.

    "Answer": "Today, there are so many different types of houses or apartments that it is really difficult to decide what type of apartments I would like to live in. However, one thing is for sure that I would want my apartment to be equipped with all kinds of modern amenities and features.\n\nFirst of all, I want my apartment to be located at a beautiful suburb, having wide streets, a big and clear lake and lots of trees, which wouldn’t be too far away from the city. My apartment should be about 2000 square feet that have 4/5 rooms with one master bedroom. All the rooms should have a spacious balcony attached to them. The apartment should be located on the 4th or 5th floor of a tall building, that has a 24-hour lift or elevator facility and enough empty space around so that I can have a perfect view of my beautiful surroundings from my apartment.\n\nSince I want my apartment to be fully loaded with all kinds of modern amenities, I want a modern gym or fitness room that includes a yoga studio in addition to a large hot tub that is full of water, used for hydrotherapy, relaxation or pleasure. It should also have a digital media and game centre with a home theatre that has high-end screens and enough reclining chairs to accommodate up to a dozen guests, and a billiard table in order to help me enjoy my time during my leisure hours. Needless to say, I also want a large kitchen with a very modern-looking cabinet, dishwasher and washing machine in it, and kitchen to be attached to a large dining-cum-sitting area. Finally, in addition to having Wi-Fi internet system and satellite TV, my apartment should also have automatic security lock system in order to ensure maximum security.\n\nAnyway, I would like to live in this apartment because it would make me feel comfortable enough to spend my time there without ever getting bored. Besides, I would like to live in it because it would also allow me to live close to a natural and clean environment, full of trees and a lake."

    "Answer": "I currently live in our house which is a 2 storied building. But in the future, I would like to live in a farmhouse in my hometown. The house would be a small one with 4-5 rooms in it. But there would be plenty of trees, gardens, ponds and open spaces in from of the house. I want to live close to nature rather than living in a cramped metropolitan building. The house would be built with woods, leaves, some modern materials and tin. There would be a big veranda in front of the house. Trees would be all around the house.\n\nThis would not be a very big house in terms of the size of the rooms. But definitely, the total farmhouse would be well over 1 acre. I would not require a very big house because I won’t have different types of furniture and showpieces. I will have only the necessary household appliances and furniture.\n\nThis house would be located in our hometown which is (…say your hometown's name...) in (...say the district/ division/ country name/ city name...). We already have a house there but I would convert it to a farmhouse in future when I will start living there.\n\nCurrently, I am living in a metropolitan city and leading a busy life. I do not wish to live in this crowded and busy city after my retirement. I have a plan to take early retirement and then build a farmhouse in my hometown that would allow me living in a place which offers fresh air, clean environment, pollution-free living and healthy and fresh food. This is the main reason I want to live there. Secondly, I already have a house there and converting it to a farmhouse would not be that difficult. Finally, I don’t want to live an idle life after my retirement and building a farmhouse and living there would allow me to get involved in many works that I won’t be able to do at my current living place."

    "Answer": "I live in one of the crowded cities in the world where life can become really hectic. Thankfully, there are some public gardens also in this crowded city which allows people to take some fresh breath of air. Today, I would like to talk about one such garden in my city which I remember visiting.\n\nIt is actually called Dhaka Botanical Garden which is located in one part of the capital city of Bangladesh and also adjacent to Dhaka Zoo. This National Botanic Garden of Bangladesh and the Bangladesh National Herbarium make up the largest plant conservation centre in Bangladesh, with an area of around 84 hectares (210 acres).  \n\nThe garden provides learning and recreational facilities. It is divided into 57 sections and is managed by the Forest Department under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of Bangladesh.  There are millions of plants which are eye-soothing. It is one of the largest botanical gardens of Bangladesh, and a nature learning centre for the nature lovers, bird watchers, photographers and botanists and a tourist destination. The Garden has a scientific collection of approximately 100,000 preserved specimens of plants.\n\nPeople can actually do pretty much everything at this place, including relaxing at a restaurant, walking in its wide space freely, renting a boat, watching beautiful lotus flowers in ponds in addition to watching water plants and birds from the observation decks.  In fact, thousands of people visit this place in the morning, without paying any fees, in order to do jogging while families also bring their children to enjoy the beautiful nature.    \n\nAnyway, I remember visiting this beautiful garden because I have seen the most beautiful flowers there, with trees as old as 500 years, as well as some really stunningly beautiful landscaping. In fact, once I visited the place, I felt like I was lost in nature for a while roaming around it, and walking on its smooth roads while playing hide and seek with the shadows of the long trees on them. In fact, it helped me relax my mind by forgetting about all the worldly worries for a while."

    "Answer": "I remember visiting a big garden at my uncle’s house when I was a college student. The garden was so big and was so beautiful that I still remember it. It was at my maternal uncle’s farmhouse and was adjacent to a narrow lake. My uncle lives in a 4 storied building but he had a firm house and a very nice garden that he looked after. This was a very good earning source for him as well.\n\nOne day he invited me to visit the garden with him and I agreed to visit it. I became speechless when I entered into the garden. It was at least 2-3 acres and had been placed beside a lake. A soft, balmy wind was blowing and the flowers were dancing with the wind. I have never seen so many flowers together that I watched in this garden. There were fences all around the garden to protect it from savage animals. There were several types of trees in this garden including flowers trees, vegetable & fruit trees and big trees to give shadows to other trees.\n\nThis was not a public garden so the entry was restricted for the people to enter the garden. But I have noticed that people could easily come near the garden as the lake was a public place. They enjoyed the beauty of the garden from outside. The people who take care of the garden water the trees, cut off the unexpected branches of the trees, takes away the dust and rubbish and keep a close eye in the garden so that, wild animals cannot cause any harm.\n\nI remember the garden because it was so beautiful and was near the lake. The several numbers of flowers in the garden and the chattering of the known and unknown birds overwhelmed me. I was supposed to be there for an hour or so but I was so much attracted to the beauty of this garden that I stay there for several hours."

    "Answer": "I read all kinds of magazines because they can be some great source of information and entertainment. However, while they all can be interesting one way or another because of their contents, I prefer to read men’s magazines. Today, I would like to talk about one such men’s magazine that I think is interesting.\n\nThe name of this men’s magazine is “Men’s Journal”. I came to know about this great magazine for the first time when I was trying to search for some innovative but easy exercises for men on the internet about 5 or 6 years ago. By the way, I like to remain healthy whether it is by eating healthy or getting some exercises. But, unfortunately, it is not always possible to cook some healthy dinners or hitting a gym as often as I would like because I remain busy with my work, and I just don’t have enough time to do either of those activities.\n\nSo, on that day, when I saw “Men’s Journal” on the internet, I naturally felt interested to learn more about it by accessing its website, and the wealth of information, I found in it, was simply mind-boggling.  It literally contains all kinds of health-related information, including holistic approaches to physical and mental fitness, adventure guides, recipes on healthy foods,  information on men’s fashion and style (both traditional and contemporary), and travel guide. The magazine also includes expert advice from some of the world’s best men’s health experts and fitness trainers. And the great thing about this magazine is that it can be easily read on the internet as it has an online version. However, one can buy it also from newspaper and magazine selling kiosk or newsstand.\n\nAnyway, I think that this magazine is interesting because it pretty much covers all kinds of information in order to help men act like a man while also living a very complete and happy life. Besides, the magazine also goes to a great length to offer new insight and perspective on men’s overall well-being by adding new features and information to it almost every month."

    "Answer": "In this busy life, we don’t really get enough time to enjoy much social and family life, despite our best efforts and intention. Still, whatever spare time we manage, we try to make the best use of it, just like I did recently by attending a birthday party.\n\nIt was the birthday of one of my close friends who lives in a different city.  I would have almost forgotten about this birthday if I hadn’t tried to organize the desk of my living room. In fact, it was on that desk that I found the little note, I wrote about a couple of weeks ago, about the special occasion and its date. Luckily it fell on a weekend, so it was really a great opportunity for me, after all, to enjoy a little social life.\n\nAnyway, the \"birthday\" party took place at the residence of my good friend who lives in a rather large house with his entire family, including his parents, wife and a couple of his siblings. The birthday party was also attended by a number of our common friends and a number of close relatives of my friend. I think that there were about 50 people altogether, who attended the birthday party, and all of them were enjoying their time in a very friendly atmosphere while enjoying some snacks and soft drinks also at the same time. Finally, the time for the cake cutting ceremony arrived, and we all sang the “happy birthday” song to wish a very happy and long life for my friend. After spending about a couple of happy and fun hours at the party, we ended it on a good note with a light dinner meal to satisfy our appetite.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed the birthday party of my friend as it allowed me to forget about the worries of my life for a while. Besides, at the party, I felt free to laugh with my heart’s content and crack any jokes with my friends after a long time. All in all, it was a great birthday celebration which made everybody happy."

My friend's name is Ryan and his parents wanted to celebrate his birthday just before his departure to the United Kingdom. Ryan invited almost all of his close friends and 6-7 of us attended the birthday celebration together. Apart from us, there were as many as 100 other people present on the occasion. I did not know most of them but my guess is that they would be mostly Ryan's relatives, neighbours and his father's colleagues.\n\nThe party was celebrated at my friend's house at (...tell a city name....). We went there together and bought a present for Ryan. After reaching there, Ryan and his parents warmly welcomed us. Later on, Ryan introduced us to his relatives and to some of his neighbours. We were astonished when we saw the huge birthday cake. 25 candles of different colours were lit around the cake and the whole house was redecorated for the occasion. Anybody could say that some occasion was going on in this house without knowing anything.\n\nWe sang the birthday song when Ryan cut the cake. We congratulated him and wished him a prosperous life ahead. Then we ate cake and had a good feast. The foods were delicious and good. We, friends of our circle, went to visit a nearby place and sang different songs. In the evening we went to Ryan's house again and attended a raffle draw. That was a very exciting part of the birthday celebration. Then after a few minutes, we left the party and went to our homes."

    "Answer": "I am one of those people who like to find peace near water. So, whenever I get an opportunity, I try to visit a lake, river or ocean, especially, if they have some great landmarks or natural views. Today, I would like to talk about one such body of water, which I visited with a group of my office colleagues last year.\n\nThe name of this is called “Ram Sagor National Park”, which is located at the village of Tejpur, about 8 km south of Dinajpur town, in the northern part of Bangladesh. By the way, the word “Sagor”, means a “lake”.  Named after a landlord called “Ram Nath”, this beautiful water body is considered to be the largest man-made lake in Bangladesh. Excavated between the year of 1750 and 1755, this national park has a size of about 44 hectares that stretches 1080 meters along north-south and about 193 meters along the east-west. Some say the lake is the biggest man-made water reservoir because it helped the people to meet their demand for clean drinking water more than a couple of centuries ago.\n\nAnyway, I and my co-workers visited this beautiful national park to enjoy our yearly picnic event. Apart from having our picnic, we also did fishing and riding boats. However, the best part of our activities was that we actually got to play with many different kinds of deer and Blue Bull while taking pictures of white-Breasted Water Hen, Jacanas, Moorhen, Ringed Plover and Grey/Purple Herons also.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed visiting this place so much that wanted to come back to this place again and again. It was a nice place, with great natural beauty, and offered just a perfect measure of quietness to feel the nature around. A variety of ornamental and fruit trees, that has flourished and become lush forested areas around the lake, was good enough to captivate the hearts and minds of its visitors. Finally, the fun experience of catching fish from the lake and enjoying \"fish barbecue\" with them just can’t be described in any words. All in all, it was a fantastic place to visit."

I chose to talk about it because I really enjoyed my visit there.\n\nThe name of the river was (...say a river's name...) and it was in (...say a place's name...). One of our relatives invited us to visit their house and we decide to visit there. I went there with 4 of my family members including my parents. After we reach there, I was amazed to notice that our relative's house was near a big river. This was the first time I visited those relatives and I was very excited about the natural beauty there.\n\nAfter we reach our relative's house, my younger sister told me that she would like to visit the river. I restrained her by saying that we will all go there in the evening. In the evening we went near the river and the river was very calm at that moment. A sweet wind was blowing from the river and the weather was very pleasant. We sat near the river and had our tea. That was a kind of family picnic. I had my younger brother, sister, my parents and 3 of our relatives at this place. Since this was the summer season, we felt very comfortable being at the bank of the river. We noticed many boats were in the river and we planned to rent a boat for an hour. When we were in the boat, the wind suddenly started blowing heavily. We quickly came to the high land and left for our relative's house."

This was a great experience and really refreshing vacation for me. I stayed at a hotel very near to the beach and enjoyed the life and nature of this place. The water, people from different states, the sound of the sea, the tide gave a pleasure that I cherished. This is one of the most famous beaches in the world and the water is very clean. I had two friends (Mark & John) with me and we enjoyed the tide & ebb, sunrise, sunset, the sun shines, roaring of the sea and the natural beauty surrounding the shore.\n\nThis is one of the most beautiful beaches in the USA and a lot of people come here every day especially in summer. I swam in the sea, ran and played in the sand, made monuments with the sands, played beach volleyball with my friends, ate sea fishes and other delicious foods during my stay. The sound of the wind blow at night was something out of the world and hallucinating. I went to the beach at the mid-night and that was an experience incomparable to anything else.\n\nThe beach is sandy and in the summer it glitters like diamonds. The water was fresh and blue and we could see the sky reflecting on it. The nights at the seashore were mesmerising and very much different than the day-life and crowd. The moon reflected in the seawater and the strong and seductive smell in the wind took me to the world unknown to me.\n\nThe journey was very much pleasant and refreshing for me. I enjoyed the picture like the sea, beach life and tasty Miami food. The people were nice and I talked to a lot of people during my visit. The natural scenery of the sea and the sea-beach is really something worth visiting. This seawater and its deep blue colour had a real attraction and illusion that took my heart away."

    "Answer": "No doubt, Bangladesh, my homeland, is a very beautiful country as it has so many beautiful places to visit. Of course, I have already travelled to some of those beautiful places before. But today, I would like to talk about a place where I would like to travel to in the near future.\n\nThe name of this place is “Sylhet”. Located on the picturesque “Surma” River (one of the major rivers of Bangladesh) valley, this hilly city is situated in the eastern part of Bangladesh and is also one of the best holiday destinations of my country. Laid between towering hills, called the “Khasia” and “Jainta” to the north and the Tripura hills to the south, Sylhet city breaks the monotony of the flat Gangetic plains (related to the area, drained by the Indus and Ganges rivers, especially the lowland plain south of the Himalayas) and is often termed as the Queen of Hills.\n\nBesides, while its terraced tea gardens, rolling landscapes, exotic flora and fauna set the breathtaking views, its thick tropical rain forest also adds just the perfect backdrop to the Sylhet landscape.  A large number of rivers, natural lakes and water bodies are also there in order to provide a sanctuary to millions of migratory birds. In fact, many people from all over the world travel to this place every year because of its stunning natural beauty. Anyway, I am also planning to travel to this place, sometime next year, but depending on the time of the year, I would either take a train or fly in order to go there.\n\nAnyway, I like to visit this place, primarily because of stunning natural beauty, including its gushing waterfalls, mountains and greenery. I also want to see the beautiful tea garden because it is one of our major exporting products, which helps us earn a very substantial amount of foreign currency. Finally, I want to travel to this place, because it has one of the best weather systems in my country, and I also want to be able to enjoy it for some times."

So my turn to visit his place has become mandatory. As he is living in a rural area where hills, tea gardens are available, I am sure I will enjoy my visit there.\n\nThere are three options to visit the place- bus, train and aeroplane. For me, the aeroplane would be a bit expensive and I like travelling by train, so I will take the train to visit there. I have a few reasons to visit this particular place. First of all, this area is famous for its natural beauty and a good number of local and foreign tourists visit this place each year. I would be able to enjoy my stay and live close to nature during my stay there and that would be refreshing for me.\n\nSecond, I would enjoy my friends accompany there and as he has already visited my place twice, I feel kind of obliged to visit his living place. Another reason I would like to travel there is to stay away from the busy life and busy city for dew days."

    "Answer": "This is an interesting question because I think the answer I’ll give reflects what I think of as ‘success’ to me being a successful business isn’t necessarily about making the owner rich, or growing the company bigger each year, it can be about other things too.\n\nI’m going to tell you about a small company I know, how I know it, what they produce and why I would call it successful. As to how it became successful, well I suppose I’ll have to just offer my best guess – if it was possible to explain why a company does well I think we would all be entrepreneurs in the making!\n\nThe company I am thinking of is run by a friend of mine. We met through a running club. She makes very high-quality bespoke cookies. The biscuits themselves are delicious, but actually, it isn’t really so much about the food, it’s about the way she designs and presents them. She will do any design or theme and create special shaped and decorated biscuits to order. So, for example, if you have a friend who is celebrating a special birthday, and they love cycling and rock climbing, she might make up a box of biscuits including one in the shape of a bike, some mountains and ropes to represent abseiling equipment. She does a lot of wedding favours – small biscuits with a personal design incorporating the initials of the bride and groom on e.g. the number plate of a classic car perhaps. She even did a special order for me. A friend of mine had a riding accident and broke her arm very badly. To cheer her up I asked my biscuit making friends make a very special box. It featured a cartoon version of the horse she had been riding; the back of an ambulance; a syringe – to represent the morphine injections the paramedics had issued, and a representation of my friend with her arm in plaster.  It was brilliant!\n\nAs to why the business is successful, I think it’s for a number of reasons. The actual cost of ingredients is quite modest so the overheads aren’t huge, so my friend is able to add value through her artwork. She meets a niche need, I don’t know of any similar businesses in the region so there is not too much competition. She can also send her biscuits through the post, and they both travel and keep well, so she can supply all over the world – in theory at least, a limitless market. It helps that she is good at what she does so repeat orders keep on coming. However, whilst that explains how she keeps in profit, for me what makes the business a success, is that she has found a way of working for herself that generates an income, but gives her a really good work-life balance. She can work flexibility and take time off when she needs to. If she wants to go for a run in the morning before work and start late she can; if she thinks the lovely weather means she’d be better off working on her allotment she can do that too – although, of course, the work has to be done later. It is fantastic that she has made a success of her business idea, and the company has grown enough that she is also able to employ a part-time assistant to help her in busy spells as well.\n\nSetting up the business was an act of faith, there were no guarantees when she started out, but she has worked hard, built up and retained a good reputation, and her products always raise a smile of delight in the recipient. Her main problem is that customers complain about her biscuits look too good to eat. This frustrates her, they are made for eating,’ keep a photo eat the biscuits’ is her advice, and she should know, she baked them herself!"

    "Answer": "I live in a medium-size town with a population of about only 2 million. However, even though, it is not a big commercial city, it still has a sizable number of local businesses and companies, which have gained some great popularity and success. Today, I would like to talk about one such company which has done really well with its business.\n\nThe company, I am talking about, is a bakery factory. I have known about this factory since my high school years as it provided regular Tiffin snacks, such as cakes and biscuits, to the students of our school on behalf of our school authority. Since those days, I have always enjoyed their bakery products which include all kinds of bread, cakes and biscuits, as well as many other kinds of pastries and snacks.\n\nAs far as I know, this bakery factory remains open pretty much every day, even though it has a varied opening and closing hours throughout the week.  Located in one corner of my town, this bakery factory supplies its products not only in its hometown but also to a number of other shops outside of its own town. Interestingly enough though, since the day the bakery had started its business, it never really extended its plant. Instead, what they have done, in order to meet the growing demand of their products, is that they have increased the number of working shifts so that more and more can work there, and that I would call a “smart” move.  \n\nHowever, even though, it has increased production, still one would hardly find any of their products left unsold at their store at the end of their business hours. So, based on their sales and their operation outside of their own town, it is fair to conclude that it is a successful company.  \n\nAnyway, to answer how the company became successful, I think that it did so by maintaining the good quality of their products. Besides, it is successful also because it never hesitates to diversify its products different times of the year, depending on the taste and preferences of its customers."

I saw an advertisement made by this company on TV first, at least 5 years ago, and then heard from others how this small company is contributing to employ many people while making a good percentage of profit.\n\nThe small company I am talking about produces a variety of food products, food cans and delicious sauce and additives. Approximately, its operation backs to over 15 years ago, when it was a small factory in the North of Iran. Gradually, it was expanded to other parts of the country, and its numerous branches made it a very prosperous business.\n\nWhile the number of its branches was only 2 in 2000, it has reached almost 50 across the country. Besides, the number of products increased from 10 items to just over 100 items. Though this is still a small business, it is improving and expanding pretty fast.\n\nLastly, the quality of its products has been improved fundamentally compared to the past, leading it to open some branches in other countries and becoming a famous brand of food-company in our region."

It also has a video resolution of 1280 x 720.\n\nAnyway,  after buying it, initially, I didn’t really find much use for it except, of course, recording every little moment of my nephew, but as more and more time passed, I became interested in using for other purposes and activities. Slowly and slowly, I started to carry it outside with me, when travelling to any places, and then also started to make videos of nature around me. The more I was using it, the better I was feeling about my camera and my works.  Later on, I felt bold enough to carry my camera even to some parties, like wedding and birthdays, in order to capture the fun and happy moments. After that, I never really looked back, as I carried my little camera pretty much everywhere with me like a trusted friend.\n\nAnyway, my video camera is important to me because it allows me to capture the favourite moments of my life, as well as the life of other important people around me, on my own terms. Besides, it keeps me busy when I don’t really feel like doing anything constructive or feel bored. Finally, it also allows me to look back to some of my favourite moments of the past when I feel down and depressed."

    "Answer": "I have several pieces of modern technology and electronic gadgets that I often use and among them, I would like to talk about the laptop I have. This is a laptop computer which is manufactured by HP. This laptop has a good configuration and it supports most of the latest software. It came with the Windows 8 operating system and it was a bit expensive for me to buy. I bought it a few months ago when I replaced my old Dell laptop with this new one.\n\nI use it for my official purposes as well as personal purposes. I use the internet, communicate with my friends using this laptop. I sometimes prepare some documents, surf the internet and play games on it as well. This laptop serves my entertainment also. I watch movies, listen to music and play games on it. In fact, I use this laptop more frequently than any other electronic device I have except the cell phone.\n\nI own a laptop for more than 10 years but I bought this current one 3-4 months ago. Since technology changes and to use the latest software and to get faster performance, we need to upgrade our computers and laptops, I replaced my old laptop with this new one.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, I use this laptop to use the internet, play games, create documents, contact my friends, maintain my blogs, watch movies, listen to music and for many other important purposes. This laptop has become an unavoidable technology for me that I use almost every day."

    "Answer": "In fact, I own several techno devices & gadgets and out of those, I would like to talk about the Kindle Fire that I have. This device is produced and sold by Amazon and I ordered it from their website last year.\n\nThis device is both a tabloid and a digital book reader. To me it is a very important technology device for purchasing online products, listening audiobooks and reading eBooks. I have noticed that after I have bought this device, the percentage of my reading has increased significantly. I use it to read eBooks and with the Wi-Fi connectivity, it becomes easier to find books online. The charges last for a couple of weeks and this is a great device for reading books. As I bought it last year, I own it for more than a year and with time this has become an important electronic device that I own. This device is my best companion when I make my journey. The perfect design, nice outlook, good quality hardware and nice user interface make it an ideal device for book lovers. To me, this is an important device as this fulfils my appetite for reading. With the internet connection with this device, I now have access to an immense number of books and reading materials. Before purchasing it, I used to read 1 book in a month on an average which has increased to around 3-4 books per month after I bought this device.  \n\nI love and enjoy reading and this is a really good device for digital reading. It is immensely important to read and for me, this Kindle Fire is a companion I would like to have always with me. In fact, sometimes I consider it to be the most important and utilitarian electronic devices I ever had."

    "Answer": "Ooh, my favourite item of clothing! I’m not much of a clothes horse, to be honest, I’m not very interested in fashion so at first, I thought this topic might be quite hard. However, I’ve thought of one. I’ll tell you what it is, when and why I bought it and why I like it so much.\n\nThe item is in itself unremarkable. It is a purple craghoppers’ long-sleeved shirt. It is made of a quick-drying poly-cotton blend and the fabric has some stretchy qualities which make it easy to wear. The fabric keeps out the sun, and the design incorporates a couple of pockets, one of which has a zip so you can keep small items securely on your person. It is designed as a travel shirt, and to be honest, was rather expensive compared to clothes I would normally buy.\n\nI bought the shirt online ahead of travelling to South East Asia. It was just coming out of winter in the UK, but I’d be going to a hot climate. I wanted something lightweight and comfortable to take with me. It was the wrong time of year to be browsing shops in England, they were all still full of winter clothes, so I just had to trust the description on the site that this would be a good buy, but I was nervous in case it didn’t fit or wasn’t practical. I shouldn’t have worried.\n\nI LOVE this shirt. It is incredibly comfortable to wear, the colour suits me quite well, and even though it is designed as a travel shirt, it’s actually smart enough to wear for work if you match it with some respectable trousers (or a skirt I suppose, but I never wear skirts!). It washes brilliantly, and if you shake it out and put it on a hanger it dries crease-free within an hour or so. The hidden pocket is handy for carrying emergency cash on your person, and I like to have a hanky with me too – there is a pocket for that as well. Because the shirt is so comfy, and much harder wearing than I expected, I wore it almost all the time on my travels. This means that the shirt is now linked to very many happy memories of places I’ve been, people I’ve met and adventures I’ve had. I wish I’d bought loads of them at the same time. I’ll be heart-broken when it eventually wears out as one day it surely must.\n\nTalking about it has got me thinking – would it really hurt to have another quick look at their travel clothes website once again? You never know, perhaps they’ll have a sale on and it would be a shame to miss out..."

    "Answer": "To tell the truth, I have a number of favourite clothing items, depending on what I like to wear on what occasions and what time of the year. For example, I have a favourite clothing item for the summertime while another for the winter. But, since this is wintertime, I would like to talk about one of my favourite clothing items which I like to wear during this cold season.\n\nThe name of this favourite clothing item is called “Blazer”. Of course, we all know what a blazer really is in general, but, to be more specific, it is a single or double-breasted men's jacket which is buttoned near the waist and ending at the bottom of the buttocks. This distinct piece of clothing has endured for a century because it builds out the shoulders of a man while also exaggerating the trimness of his waist at the same time, and its solid lines allow the eyes to move up and down the body without actually being jarred to the right or left.\n\nLuckily, I already have one of these clothing items, and it is made of wool, apparently because I like to wear it during the wintertime only in order to keep myself warm. By the way, a blazer can either be expensive or affordable depending on what kind of fabrics it is made of. For example, if it is made from pure wool or brushed cotton, it would be expensive. But, if it is made from some kind of polyester or synthetic fabrics, it would be rather affordable. So, really, its price depends on your taste of fabrics.  \n\nAnyway, I like this item of clothing, primarily because it helps me keep warm during the winter season, especially, when I am going out of my home. Besides, it is also one of those clothing items which make a man look elegant. Finally, it is one of my favourite clothing items also because it is so versatile, as I can wear it for any occasion both formally or casually with any other kinds of outfits."

    "Answer": "I purchase my own clothes most of the time and there are many dresses I really like to wear and out of those the leather jacket that I have is my most favourite. This is a brown coloured stylish jacket that I purchased 2 years ago. I bought it from an expensive brand shop which mainly sells winter dresses.\n\nAfter I moved to the capital city, I found my old winter dresses to become backdated and I was planning to purchase a new one. The jacket I bought is really a favourite piece of clothing I have in my collection. I bought it mainly because I needed a new cloth for the winter season and this one looked very stylish and seemed like made by good materials. I wandered in several shops and markets and was having a hard time finding a stylish and good looking jacket. All of a sudden this one caught my eyes and after trying it in the trial room, I instantly decided to purchase it.\n\nI wear it only the winter season and this jacket gives me the warmth I need to protect from the chilly and cold weather. I like it very much as it goes with my choice and necessity. Some of my friends appreciated this piece of cloth and they inquired where I purchased it from. I can wear it with both the casual and formal dresses and that gives me a good advantage. Besides fashion, this cloth offers utilitarian values as well. I feel comfortable and protected in this dress and it did not cost me a lot.\n\nI don’t have a huge collection of dresses and I do not purchase dresses that I would not wear. But sometimes I find myself in a dilemma when I purchase a dress and later on find it very ordinary. But this leather jacket was exceptional. I have felt a great joy after I purchased it and still this is the best winter jacket I have. For all those reasons this dress has become my most favourite piece of cloth I own."

    "Answer": "Most of the times, I think that the advertisements just a waste of time, because they don’t really do any good for the general public. But, then, suddenly we come across an advertisement, which forces us to think otherwise, just as I was also forced to think like that about a couple of years ago.\n\nIt is an advertisement about “tea” – drinking tea that is. By the way, I would say that it was one of the best advertisements I had ever seen in a long, long time, as it was made in a very clear manner to deliver a clear message in the form of having some light jokes and conversation.\n\nAnyway, I saw this advertisement on television for the first time about a year ago or so. In the advertisement, a stage is perfectly set for an enjoyable evening for 4 people, including two wives and two husbands. They were all busy talking and laughing with each other while enjoying some snacks also at the same time. Then, it was the time for some hot tea in order to conclude the evening time to get together for the day.  So, anyway, when everybody was busy to pour sugar in their cup full of tea while zooming in the brand name of the tea, they noticed that one of the wives was not taking any sugar. When asked, why the lady was not taking any sugar, she smilingly answered that she always likes to keep her sugar and husband under control. After that joke, everybody burst out in laughter.  And, with that laughter, the advertisement was concluded.  \n\nAnyway, I really like the advertisement and find it effective, mainly because it is trying to deliver a very clear message to its audience about controlling their sugar consumption also in order to check their diabetes while enjoying their tasty tea as much as they can. I like the advertisement also because it revealed a very sweet but an age-old rivalry between a husband and wife as to who gets to control who in a romantic relationship."

One such advertisement that I really liked was regarding the unmatched contributions of mothers for their kids which I saw a few months back. The advertisement was broadcasted for the 'Mother's Day' and it was not for any product. The ministry of child & mother care of health department was the sponsor of this ad and I saw it 3-4 days before the last 'Mother's Day'.\n\nThis ad was a very creative one and it was not like the most other ads that publicise or advertise their products. Rather it was an advertisement dedicated to the mothers and it reminded us that the toughest job in the world is the job done by mothers. They take care of their kids with the utmost care and dedication. They sacrifice their own wished and will to properly bring up the kids.\n\nI saw this ad in the (...say a channel name..) UR TV channel. This was a creative ad that effectively delivered the message it intended to. It has shown some successful person in the history at the end and before that, it showed how mothers are taking care and inspiring their kids to do good things and in the end, it shows the tribute to the mothers of the world for their valuable and second to none contribution."

    "Answer": "There are several types of advertisements that we see daily on TV, billboards, through the Internet, social networking sites, mobile applications, and mobile games. Many of them are very banal, full of marketing speech and kind of boring while others are average and their primary focus is to express the positive sides of a product to increase the sales. Finally, quite a few of them are creative, informative, humorous, fascinating and memorable.\n\nI usually do not like to watch advertisement between a movie/ TV programme and large commercial breaks are quite annoying to me. I personally think that the best way of advertising is using billboards, which can lead you to remember the brand name forever without actually annoying you.\n\nWell, the best advertisement I have ever seen that I still like about its uniqueness was on a highway in the United Arab Emirates and I really liked the idea of this advertisement. One day while passing the main road a big billboard caught my eyes. It was designed to look like the filtration zone of a cigarette which is commonly known as the cigarette butt. The large billboard was quite different in shape and it presented the message ‘Stop smoking even Marlboro’ quite visibly.  \n\nI stole a glance at the billboard and thought about the message it conveyed. I actually did not think much and forgot about it. After an hour I found myself in front of a beach with a packet of Marlboro cigarette in my pocket. While I was lighting a cigarette, I was wondering why I bought a packet of Marlboro? It is usually not my brand! To my surprise, I realised that the advertisement that I saw on the road had an immense effect on my psychology unconsciously. I was convinced that the billboard had forced me to buy that brand unconsciously. I think it was the first time I realised how advertisements can target people's unconscious mind. Technically speaking this is the moment I realised that the best way to influence people’s buying behaviour is to use their unconscious mind instead of trying to deliver marketing speeches. When I thought more to analyse the billboard advertising and its effect on me, I realised that the advertiser tried to use reverse advertising techniques by delivering the message that Marlboro is less dangerous and smokers who wish to quit smoking should try this. Possibly all smokers- from light smokers to heavy ones, wish a day without smoking though many of them do not try hard. Then the billboard advertisement was pretending as if they were broadcasting an important public safety message. Moreover, they used a fascinating design on the billboard that would actually grab anyone's attention. As you can see, they were quite successful as I still remember this advert very vividly and I like this advertisement due to the creative thinking of the maker."

    "Answer": "During my high school years, I wasn’t exactly very much fond of working on a project.  But, I just didn’t have any other options back then except working on those projects, in order to get some good grades, and I would like to talk about one of those projects today.\n\nAnyway, the project, I want to talk about, was creating an advertising campaign to sell a product in my 10th grade.  Of course, the product could be anything from a popular snack item to an expensive electronic device. Luckily, I was allowed to work with a few other classmates of mine, otherwise, it would have been really difficult for me to finish the project on my own.\n\nWe were supposed to finish the project within two weeks, and I thought that it was a reasonable amount of time to do so. But, when we actually started to work on the projects, it took us about a few days just to argue and come up with the idea of a suitable product. Anyway, we eventually decided that we would create an advertisement campaign for selling “lemon juice”. So, we all started to find information on the health benefits of the lemon. We even kept the lemon juices at different temperatures to discover its true taste. In fact, we felt that the more information we have about the lemon juice, the easier it would get for us to create an effective advertising campaign. Finally, once we decided what particular taste of the lemon juice we would try to highlight in our advertising campaign, it didn’t take us more than 10 days to finish creating the campaign.\n\nAnyway, I learned a number of things from working on this project. The first lesson was that we all would need to work hard to listen to our legitimate arguments, even if they sound very illogical, in order to keep a team spirit alive. Secondly, I also learned that communication skill of a person, or how he/she chooses to play with our words, can have a tremendous impact on how we are regarded to other people around us."

We were asked to create 2 radio devices that would be able to clearly communicate within the 300-metre range.\n\nOur physics teacher Mr Newphen gave us the talks and I worked on this project with two other classmates from my college. The teacher gave us 15 days time but after 10 days passed, we noticed that more than half of the task was pending and we extended the time. The work took around 22 days for us to complete and show the demo.\n\nWe had to create two radio devices that would basically similar to the devices the traffic controlling officers usages. But our device would have a shorter range and would work within 300 metres. Another objective was for us to make such two devices with a very minimal cost.\n\nWe had to work hard to make it work. I learned many things from this project like, how to work on a major project with a team, how to reduce the interferences of radio frequency, how to build quality equipment in low budget, how to fine-tune a project and many other things that later became handy for my university and office projects."

So, if there is any meal, be them fast food or traditional dishes, made with chickens, whether it is from the continents of Asia, Australia or South America, I will eat them like there is no tomorrow. But, today, I would like to talk about a meal, that I like even more, is called chicken parmigiana. Some call it chicken parmesan, depending on where you are eating it.  \n\nIt was about a few months ago when I was visiting my sister’s place in another city in order to celebrate her new job as a Sr. Manager at a multinational bank. My sister and my nephews teamed up together in favour of making some delicious meals at home with mutton curry. They also requested for some long-grain, steam rice. But, I, my brother-in-law and my niece were planning to visit a new restaurant, which just opened up a few weeks earlier. In fact, my brother-in-law told me that the restaurant was offering some great dishes at great some great discounted price. However, he also told me that their best and signature dish was chicken parmigiana.\n\nSince we were going to an Italian restaurant, the meal was prepared with an Italian style and flavour which included breaded and juicy chicken breast, covered in tomato sauce, along with mozzarella cheese. By the way, the dish was also served with some classic Caesar salad on the side with some Italian ranch dressing on it. As soon as the meal was served, my sister’s whole family, including me, started to enjoy that meal like there is no tomorrow. My nephew and niece ordered for some even more chicken parmesan.\n\nAnyway, we all enjoyed this meal so much, mainly because it was cooked to perfection with some generous amount of melted cheese on it. Besides, the hot pasta, served with the dish, was stimulating our taste bud like we would never want to stop eating them. All in all, it was a great family meal for any occasion."

Today, I would like to talk about one such wedding ceremony that I attended about a few months ago.\n\nI would like to say that it was a “marriage from heaven”. Some even called it “marriage of the year” because thousands of people attended it. By the way, a wedding ceremony, a traditional one in the cultural context of my country, of one of my first cousins, who also happened to be the only child and son of his parents. So, they made all kinds of arrangements, which included bringing some of the best catering people from the town to cook virtually all kinds of traditional and non-traditional delicious dishes and hiring a famous musical band of my country to play music, to make the wedding ceremony even a more memorable one.\n\nBy the way, the marriage had taken place at a local but very big party centre which could accommodate thousands of people. At the ceremony, the guests were busy greeting each other while enjoying some snacks. The music was being played at one corner of the party centre people some young people were also dancing to the tune of music. One of the best things about that wedding ceremony was that the party centre was decorated with some marvellous lighting system, potted plants and some fresh flowers. And, of course, people dressed to kill to make the wedding ceremony to look even more colourful and dreamy.\n \nAnyway, I enjoyed this wedding ceremony because there were so many nice things that were going on at the ceremony while it also followed the traditional values and customs of our culture. In fact, I would say that it was a wedding ceremony, which was enjoyed by all kinds of people of all ages from all over the city. It was an expensive wedding ceremony, but the fun was worth it."

I can recall that it was mid-summer and I took 4-day-leave from my university to attend the program.\n\nMy cousin Ruby got married and she was the daughter of my eldest maternal uncle. Among our cousins, she was the eldest and she was 24 years old when she got married to a doctor. I was at the wedding from the very beginning, shopping till the departure of the bride to her father-in-law's house. The whole house was decorated, we celebrated a ceremony 3 days long, lots of relatives and neighbours came to congratulate the bride and they brought some gifts for her as well. The host prepared several delicious dishes and sweets and everyone wore new and traditional dresses. Everyone enjoyed, sang and danced, the whole program was recorded and everyone cried when the bride left the house.\n\nYes, that was a typical wedding that followed the general traditions and customs. It was nothing different from the traditional marriages that are generally performed in most of the part of the country except some minor tribes and society. If fact we enjoyed the wedding because a typical marriage ceremony in our country has lots of interesting and enjoyable parts that people celebrate with boundless joys. We mostly followed the customs and thoroughly enjoyed the whole wedding program."

    "Answer": "I don’t normally watch TV unless I am interested in learning about some interesting or specific information or news. In fact, I mostly watch channels like national geography, History channel, food network channels and travel channels. But the other day, about a few months ago, my sister somewhat snatched the TV remote from me at our home and requested me to watch a program – a serial drama that is – which she thought was too interesting. Anyway, I could have simply left my sister to watch the programme alone, but I thought that it would be a bit rude to leave her alone like that. After all, she was my only little sister. So, I started to decide to watch the program with her instead.\n\nThe programme, the drama serial rather, was about a poor family, which was really struggling financially to manage the affairs of their finances. In fact, they were struggling to pay their medical bills, gas bills, and electricity bills because some of their family members, especially the two little daughters in that family, were spending a bit too much money on fashion, apparently, they were on a mission to become some famous model and eventually become very rich soon. But, the dream of those two little pretty girls just evaporated away when both of them failed to pass the audition, apparently, because they lacked the talents to become good models. Rather funnily, they blamed poverty for their lack of talent and thus their inability to become good models also. In brief, that was the story of the drama.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn’t enjoy the drama from minute one, primarily because the theme of the story didn’t quite go alone the costumes of the artists of that drama. For example, even though, it was the story of a poor family, but the dress and get up of its members looked like they belong to high-class society. Besides, I found the dialogue and conversation among the artists rather vague and artificial as if they didn’t quite know how to immerse into the demand of the characters."

But sometimes we have to watch the program that other people are watching and we do not have control on the channel changing and thus we often watch programs that we do not like at all, one such program was a talk show that I recently watched.\n\nThis was a talk show on our national TV channel (…say the name of a TV channel…) and apart from the host, there were two political figures who came from 2 opposite parties. Since this is a famous TV channel, I am sure a good number of people watched it. I watched it at a friend’s house when I was sitting in their drawing room and my friend’s uncle was watching and controlling the TV channels. \n\nThe talk show was about a sensitive national issue and the starting was interesting as the host of the program discussed in details about the program and later on asked some interesting questions to the two guests. After 5 minutes or so, I got an impression that the talk show was a scam and with this programme, the Government is trying to give some misleading facts to the viewers. The two guests started attacking each other and showed an abominable attitude to each other. That was so surprising that respectable people like them can behave so abhorrently.\n\nThe program went on and I found that I was completely irritated to see such type of behaviours from our national leaders and the feelings that this was a scam gave me nausea. I left the room before the program ended and walked outside for about 30 minutes. After I returned I found that the program ah ended and that was a kind of relief for me."

    "Answer": "I think that over the years, I have been reasonably good at time management except for some occasional hick-ups. But there was a time when I become really busy, and I was really struggling to manage my time when I was doing my Master’s degree from a university about 4 years ago.\n\nOf course, I wouldn’t really be so busy, to begin with, if I had chosen a difficult thesis topic. On top of that, I was also serving as a \"teaching assistant\" which itself was like a full-time job to check and mark the term papers of almost a hundred students. So, while I was busy attending the classes on a regular basis, I was also busy conducting the regular research works to complete my thesis and also checking the term papers of the undergraduate students at the same time since most of my teachers were very strict about getting all of his student to participate in regular class discussion.\n\nBy the way, studying an undergraduate programme and graduate program is a different story. It can be said that while in an undergraduate program, a student is able to build on previously learned concept and skills, a graduate student has to spend a lot of time in making his or her own discoveries. On top of that, the post-graduate supervisors, teachers or educators very rarely offer any lifelines to their post-graduate students. In other words, the post-graduate educators hardly provide ever any deadline extensions as far as the date of paper/thesis submission is concerned. \n\nAnyway, remaining busy is a natural thing for a graduate student because a lot depends on the results of a Masters degree as far as the question of a better career and a better life is concerned. So, it was only natural for me to remain busy at that time because I wanted to finish my university life on a good note. Besides, I also wasn’t able to manage my time that efficiently back then which made my life even busier as a graduate student."

The thesis was a complex one and I had to visit libraries, browse the internet, do group discussions and meetings and brainstorm a lot to organise the writing for the thesis. Moreover, I had to visit some local offices to collect data for my thesis. Those days were so tough and I had been so busy that sometimes I slept for 4 hours only at night.\n\nThe work pressure, tension, tight schedules, deadlines, moving from place to place, classes & study were my life. I did not visit my parents for the whole semester as they were in my hometown. There was hardly any month that I did not go to my hometown to meet my parents but during that period I did not have the chance to do so. In fact, I was unable to go to my hometown for about 7 months. I usually watch 2-3 movies on my computer each week, go for walks each morning, visit some close friends, maintain my social networking profiles and update my blog but during this period I was so busy that I did not do any of these activities I usually maintain.\n\nI am so lucky that I was finally completed the thesis and submitted it in due time. To my surprise, I got a straight 'A+' in my thesis, continued my job and did well in my term final. But for that, I had to sacrifice a lot and maintain a strict routine. I slept 4-5 hours each day on an average, read academic books and notes in public transportation while moving from one place to another, and utilised every single hour I got. Moreover, to finish things in time, I stopped a lot of my other activities that I usually do. Thus I had been able to handle the pressure and deadline. I have to thank some of my teachers, classmates and some of my friends without whom it would have been impossible for me to finish everything correctly and in time."

    "Answer": "This is such an interesting topic because I like to learn about what the future exactly holds for us and our world. While, many great movies have been made, and many books have also been written on this interesting subject, one particular book deserves to be specially mentioned here because of its interesting take on the future.\n\nThe name of this book is called “In 100 Years: Leading Economists Predict the Future” which was compiled and edited by an Economist, from the London School of Economics called Mr Ignacio Palacios-Huerta, in the year of 2014.  \n\nThis isn’t exactly like any other regular book, with chronology of thoughts or chain events, in a sense that it only contains the views and opinions of 10 prominent economists of the world, which included Nobel laureates and several other likely laureates, in order to offer their ideas about the world of the twenty-second century.\n\nAnyway, regular or not, this makes very interesting and stimulating reading because some common predictions –  as in the common ideas and thoughts of all the 10 economists – emerge in this book. Some of these predictions include, but not limited to, continual improvement in technology, diminishing poverty and population growth, and catching up with most of the relatively poor countries the rich world while the server risks of climate change and the spreading of unforeseen epidemics. But, please understand that these are just some predictions, and they may not carry any resemblance with the realities.\n\nInteresting enough though, after reading in 2017, I thought that it painted a rather rosy picture of our future world, with, of course, some predictions of bad news here and there in the book, but the main theme of the book has tried to show that the change in the “status quo” is almost inevitable as the transformation of wages and works, along with ever-increasing inequality, would probably make things lot worse before getting better, if it ever actually become better. Still, I think it is an interesting read because economists, in general, probably are more equipped to predict the future a bit better than some science fiction writers."

    "Answer": "Artificial Intelligence, also known as A.I., is a science fiction movie which was made about the future. This science-fiction drama movie was directed and produced by the famous movie maker Steven Spielberg and was released in the year 2001. This movie was adapted from a short story and was a hit in the American Box office. \n\nI watched it at the end of 2001 for the first time and later in 2012, I watched it again with my family members. The movie plot was set to a future time when the number of population was drastically reduced due to global warming and other natural disasters. As the name of the movie implies, artificial intelligence has flourished at that time and people produced robots that exactly resembled human. Not only they look like the human, but they also act, think and feel like a human. The movie set the plot at a time that is yet to come. The human-like robots, their feelings, love, hatred etc are still in its preliminary stage but the movie depicts the time when all of those have been achieved. \n\nThe storyline went on to further future, two thousand years later when the humans are extinct and Manhattan city got buried under several hundred feet of glacial ice. Then the superintelligence has evolved who could create a clone of human from the DNA. \n\nThe movie depicted the future where global warming and other natural disasters will cause a dramatic decrease in the number of the human population. At a later stage, the movie shows that humans are extinct and only highly intelligent powers exist. The intelligence gets so powerful that they can create the human from their DNA. They become interested in human and want to know about human to find the true meaning of existence."

    "Answer": "I remember many books and movies that I enjoyed and were based on future events and plots. I would like to talk about one such book that was written by James Maroon. The name of the book was ‘The lonely planet’. In my opinion, it was one of the best books I have ever read about the distant future. I love reading science fictions and this book was a very high-quality science fiction that I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nI read it 4-5 years ago when I was a freshman at the university. It was probably 2010 when I bought this book and it took me around 2 days to finish it. This book was a sure page-turner and I could not concentrate anything else while reading this book!\n\nThe story of the book begins in 2090 when technology and outer-world research is unbelievably advanced. The story of this book shows the event of the first encounter of humans with the aliens. In this story when the human first meets aliens, many of their unknown mysteries and questions about the universe, time and space get answered. On the other hand, the alien civilisation gets many of their questions answered from human life and spirit.\n\nIn the book, the future is depicted when the human becomes more technologically advanced and enriched with the necessary commodity. The society classification is a new concept in this book and the way it presented seems pretty convincing and realistic. It shows the reflection of Plato’s theory of society and unlike other science fictions, it shows that the robots and other machines are working hard to help humans and not fighting the human. The story shows that the human at that time will become more liberal, peaceful, hard-working, and benevolent. They don’t need to worry about the basic needs as they are making sure by the robots. The constructions, agriculture, farming, transportation, productions etc. laborious jobs are done by the robots. The human does mostly the research works and tries to find an alternative for starting a new colony for human as the world is moving faster to the destruction.\n\nI really enjoyed reading this book and in my opinion, the future representation in this book is quite natural and realistic."

    "Answer": "Not sure about my fellow other Australian citizens, but, I can’t really think of any other game except “cricket” as popular as any other sports. Sometimes, I even think that this glamorous game and winning in it is in our blood,  no matter which country the Australian team is playing against.\n\nAnyway, a little about the Australian cricket history should be told here for the reference of cricket lovers around the world except of course most of us already know that the cricket is being played in Australia for more than 215 years. But, the height of the popularity of this sport was achieved after starting ashes series with England in 1884. In fact, after that ashes series, Australia cricket team became a cricketing force to reckon with all over the world. Since then, Australia has played some extraordinary crickets, that has helped them defeat all cricketing nations one after another, by winning world test championship, as well as becoming the world champion in limited versions cricket like one day international and T-20 international (ICC trophy championship).   \n\nIn fact, Australia has one of the best, if not the best, national cricket team in the worlds with very a sophisticated cricket infrastructure which helps them excel as a top-class professional cricketer.\n\nAnyway, cricket is played between two teams, both consisting of 11 players each, in a large stadium, in which, both teams get to do batting and bowling in turn. Essentially, it is a game of scoring runs, and the team, making the greater number of runs, wins the match.\n\nAnyway, Cricket is a popular sport in Australia, because, frankly speaking, we are really great at it.  Besides, According to National Cricket Census for Australia, cricket is Australia's current number one participation sport after record numbers picked up a bat and ball in 2015-16.  After crunching the numbers, Cricket Australia unveiled the record-breaking results this year that suggests a record 1,311,184 people played cricket across Australia in 2015-16, an 8.5 per cent increase on 2014-15 – placing cricket at number 1 as the current top participation sport in Australia."

    "Answer": "Football is a very popular sport in our country and a great number of people play this game. In terms of popularity and people's love for football, I would say it is well developed in my country. We have some major football leagues each year and big teams participate in these games. The number of people who watch the game in the stadium and on TV is huge. The ordinary people play this game in the morning and evening and they really enjoy it. Most of the people of our country know the rules of this game and they play it whenever they get time.\n\nThough a large number of people play football in our country, cricket is the most popular game here. Our cricket team is one of the ten test cricket playing team in the world and they also play in the cricket world cup. The teenagers and young people mostly play cricket and people of all stages enjoy this game as our team plays in the world cup and in major cricket tournaments.\n\nFootball is the second most popular game in my country and we have several million spectators who enjoy major football premier leagues and the football world cup.\n\nTwo teams participate in a football game and each team has 11 players on their side. One of these 11 players is the goalkeeper who always tries to protect the goal bar. Rest of the players play in different parts of the fields namely, defence, mid-fielding, attacking-position etc. and their aim is to put the ball into the net of the opponent team’s goal bar. There is a referee, 2 linesmen or assistant referee and the match-authority to ensure the rules of the games and players get the yellow and red cards for foul play. The team that can get more goals would win the match. The length of the game is 90 minutes including a short interval and the teams interchange the position of the field after the interval. This is probably the most popular game in the world and the people in our country have a great passion for this sport."

    "Answer": "It is no secret today that we just can’t do without the internet. Whether we are using a laptop at home or carrying a smartphone outside, we have to have the internet to remain informed and communicate. Understanding the importance and necessity of this internet technology, today, we can find many cyber cafes around us.\n\nWhile I like all of those cybercafés because of their supports, I would like to talk about just one of them that I visit often. The internet café, I am talking about, isn’t exactly very far from where I live. In fact, the cybercafé is owned by one of my entrepreneurial friends who like to play with different kinds of technologies, and the internet just happens to be one of those latest technologies which he likes.\n\nInitially, when he opened up the café at a different location, far from my residence, but when he moved the place close to where I live, I started to visit that place often, mostly because I like to hang out with my friend. But, while I hang out with my friend, I don’t mind using one of his computers to surf the internet and update myself about an array of news which affects our world. Sometimes, I also like to watch some movies and interesting videos from different corners of the world while also chatting and enjoying some fresh coffee with my good friend.  \n\nAnyway, even though, my friend invites me to visit his cybercafé at least once every other day, I can do it only a couple of times a week because of my other priorities, even though I truly enjoy my time at his cybercafé.\n\nI try to visit this place often because it helps me relax and have some fun time with my friend. I like to visit it also because it allows me to exchange views and opinions on different issues with other people when chatting with them on an internet forum. Finally, I like to visit this place often also because it allows me to meet a different kind of interesting people. And, yes, I do enjoy meeting new people- both online and offline."

The name of this cyber café is ‘Express Café and Cyber Zone’ and it is only a few minutes away from our house.\n\nIt is on the 3rd floor of the ‘Shoppers Heaven Market’ and at the backside of the floor. I often go there to use the internet and take a print out. Though I have an internet connection at my home, I often go there if my internet connection is not available or if I need to take printing of important documents. I usually go there, 2-3 times in a week and enjoy the environment they offer. Sometimes I go there to purchase some computer accessories like USB cable, DVD and CD disks etc.\n\nWith the expansion of the internet, computer technology and online communications, the need for cyber café or the internet cafe has also enhanced. People often need to surf the internet for many different reasons; simply from chatting with friends to applying for jobs or talking with an overseas relative. Things are getting online nowadays and the old way of communications, mailing, talking, applying for jobs or even maintaining the banking transactions are rapidly getting online. One needs to use the internet from checking and sending emails to booking flights and that’s why we need to use the internet every now and then. But all of us do not have easy access to the internet at our home and that’s why we need to go to the cyber cafes. We never know when we will need to send or check our emails and sometimes the urgency requires us to use the internet immediately. That’s where cyber cafés play an important role. They have all the arrangement of using the internet and we can use it by paying the hourly bill which is not expensive at all. We need to take printouts of important documents, scan those or even attach them to the emails and we can easily go to a nearby cyber café and do those types of works."

    "Answer": "I have always believed that life has to be more than just coming into this world, earning a living for myself and my families, and then just leaving the world one day. Of course, this realization didn’t hit me until I reached my adulthood. But, the good thing is that as soon I realized this, I started to plan to do something more fulfilling and constructive than just earning a decent living.\n\nAnd, after giving a lot of consideration to my current lifestyle and schedule, I thought that it would be better for me to eventually establish a non-profit charitable organization while I am carrying on with my profession.\n\nOf course, it is not going to be easy to fulfil my goal because it would take a lot of time and effort on my part in order to run it as a functioning organization. But, first, I would need to obtain a license and a permit to start such a thing apart from dealing with issues like tax exemption, and networking with a group like-minded people who would be willing to help me in my effort as some kind of “board of directors”. Then, of course, there are also some legal issues like drafting bylaws and filing articles of “incorporation”. Finally, comes the all-important issue of collecting enough funds by networking with some generous individual donors and organizations that offer grants to a non-profit organization. After all, I don’t really have that kind of riches and resources to fund a charitable organization.\n\nBy the way, the purpose of establishing this charitable organization is to help the many poor and needy people around us, especially, who are sick and don’t have enough money to receive proper medical treatments.\n\nAnyway, I am pretty sure that I would feel really happy and proud when I actually achieve my goal because my little effort would probably help a lot of people in need of receiving some kind of financial help to make their life little better. Besides, I would also feel that many others would come forward with the same kinds of efforts to help our fellow other human beings."

I would start from my home country and would visit all the major tourists’ attractions and historically famous places in my country. Then I would visit the 7 wonders of different ages of the world and then other famous places in Asia, Europe, Africa and America.\n\nThis would not be an easy thing to accomplish as it would require a large amount of money and free times and in fact, there are several hundred places to go and learn about. I would require to establish my own business and to make sure that I have enough time and money to have my trips. I would start my own business and work very hard to take it to the top level. That would take a few years and I will need to get some help from my father as well. I would have to be very hardworking and prudent to achieve it.\n\nI want to do it because I have an unquenchable thrust to visit famous places and to learn about different customs and people. I want to explore the world as much as possible.\n\nThere is no end of the plan I have as our lives are limited for a certain span of time and the number of places worth visiting in the world is really enormous. But I won't plan to visit all the places but the most significant and famous places only. Once this starts and continues going (let's consider the fact that there is no end of it), I would feel very happy for every tour I would have. I would be very happy and contented to have my plan come true. That would be a truly amazing experience for me."

    "Answer": "We sure live in a big, big world with staggering mountains, massive glaciers, and beautiful forests, full of wild animals. However, while it would take a lifetime to visit only a fraction of some of these mother nature’s greatest hits, I would like to take an opportunity to talk about just one of them, which I am planning to visit sometime in next year.\n\nThe name of this naturally beautiful place is called the “Lake Van” in Turkey. Now, we all know how insanely beautiful Turkey really is, as a country, but Lake Van deserves to be specifically mentioned here because it has largely remained untouched by a slew of hotels and resorts. In fact, it is fair to suggest that even though, this is the largest lake of Turkey, located almost a thousand miles away from the east of the fleshpots of Turkey’s economic and cultural capital of Istanbul, it is still quite unknown to most foreign visitors.\n\nAnyway, with its intriguingly beautiful high altitude (about 5400 feet above sea level) and startlingly crystal-clear blue water, the Van lake region has plenty of amazing sights, historic castles, including the beautiful 10th century Holy Cross Cathedral church, and natural spectacle to “wow” the visitors. These should be enough reasons for one to visit this beautiful lake. But, if that’s not enough to persuade someone to visit this place, its stunningly beautiful sandy or pebbled beaches will.\n\nAnyway, this place is certainly worth a visit, mainly because it is all-natural in a sense that the place hasn’t yet been touched by the brutal and modern development works in the name of developing “tourism”.  Besides, this region also has a great historical significance as the lake once sat astride a major branch of the Silk Road and was also considered to be a very prosperous and populous region for many centuries up until the First World War. Finally, this region was so beautiful that the Armenian people, who lived there used to say, “Van in this world, paradise in the next”, meaning Van was a piece of paradise in this world."

It is a place that gives the impression of natural beauty, serenity and divinity as it a vast green area beside the hills and a beautiful river has passed beside it. The flowers and fields are like scenery painted by a professional painter. The butterfly, the birds, the bushes, the long trees and tea garden makes it a place worth visiting.\n\nI have heard the impeccable beauty of this place from my friends and everyone who went there has recommended it as a must-visit place. I have also read a few articles about the tourist attraction and natural beauty of this place. The writers describe it as an adventurous place, mainly because climbing on hills, swimming in the river, visiting the lightened caves at night are all adventurous activities that tourists mainly like to do there.\n\nI have a plan to visit this place in the near future when I would have a vacation of more than 7 days. The local foods of this place especially the fried fishes and shrimps are famous and that’s why I want to stay there for a few days. Most possibly I will visit this place next December.\n\nThis is a worth visiting place because it is one of the greatest naturally stunning and beautiful places. There are lots of activities to do, lots of things to see and several famous menus to test. Since lots of people visit this place and highly recommend it to others, I am sure this is a place that worth a visit"

    "Answer": "Having a perfect vacation is many people’s dreams except, of course, they don’t know how to have them most of the times. However, over the years, if I have learned one thing about enjoying a perfect vacation, it can be achieved only if we don’t worry too much about the world “perfect”. After all, it is the very ‘stress’ of planning a perfect vacation which takes the fun away from it.\n\nBut, since I will have to put the discussion of this topic into proper context, I am bound to name the spot of my vacation which could be anywhere from visiting an isolated island, far away from the rest of the civilization, to a beautiful mountain site close to a nice lake, depending on the time of the year. But, since I prefer to enjoy my vacation during the summertime, I would preferably choose a mountain site.\n\nTo be honest, my perfect idea of a vacation doesn’t include anything fancy except enjoying some good jokes and laughs with my family members and friends while forgetting about the worries about our worldly life for a while by lying at the feet of the mountain. While I am enjoying my vacation there, I want to be to able to fully connect to the mother nature which has fed us and taken care of us even though we have done to so much harm to it for last few centuries.\n\nFrankly speaking, I don’t even want to worry about cooking or eating my food when I am enjoying my perfect vacation because that would steal a lot of time from me when enjoying mother nature around me. Of course, I wouldn’t mind at all to jump in the lake and catch some fishes to do some barbecue, apart from swimming in it from the dawn to dusk.\n\nAnyway, I think, it would be a perfect vacation for me because I would be able to do anything I want there.

First of all, there would be a good plan for the vacation and the vacation would be for about a week. This has to be a different type of place that the vacation taker usually lives in. Usually, people enjoy visiting a place which has great natural beauty, quiet, offers good stay and enjoyable activities. So I would prefer a place near the sea, hill, tea garden, urban area with natural beauty or a historical place that offers a good travelling route. The journey has to be smooth and there should be tours to take the vacation takes to deferent places. \n\nI would prefer either my friends or family members to have such a great vacation. If it is my choice, I would like to go to a far end of the country or in a foreign city which offers a lot of different activities like hiking, surfing, natural sceneries and an arrangement of the comfortable stay. I would go to the famous and attractive places there, hand out with my friends, take photos, take part of the activities offered there, walk beside the open space and enjoy the night from the rooftop. I would stay in a quiet place and in the morning I would go explore the area to know about the people, their custom and culture. \n\nThis would be a perfect vacation mostly because it offers different activities and different lifestyle which are always refreshing. A vacation is aimed to recharge us and give us pleasure so that after we come back from vacation, we can concentrate our daily routine with a pleasant feeling.

Therefore, asking a complete layman person like me, with no movie or book reviewing skills, is like asking to find some treasures from underneath an ocean who can barely swim. Still, I will go ahead and try to do some justice to this topic without sounding utterly idiot.\n\nThe name of the book is “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption”, written by Stephen King. By the way, Stephen king undoubtedly is one of the best American authors of horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, and fantasy novels who has sold more than 350 million copies of his books.\n\nAnyway, the book tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (the role played by famous Hollywood actor Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades in the prison, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) and then becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden. Andy escapes from the prison while Red gets released on parole. But, they both reunite in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, at the end of the story with a glimmer of hope to start a normal life. Anyway, even though, I like the storyline of the book, I prefer the movie version of it because it helps me visualize the events of the book in a more surreal manner.\n\nNow, talking about the story of the book, I think that it is certainly a good one because there are a lot of twists and turns in it, especially, like how the prison wardens become involved with the money laundering scheme. However, the best part of this book is that it actually teaches to hold onto our hopes, no matter how bad the situation really gets, because it is the hope which gives us purpose in our life. All in all, the book has a great and engaging story."

    "Answer": "So, today I’m going to talk about a book that has had a major influence on me and based on which a movie was made. I will first tell you the name of the book, then I’ll tell you how I heard about it, next, I’ll outline the main story and finally, I will explain why it plays an important role in my life.\n\nThe book is called ‘Tracks’, and it is by an Australian woman called Robyn Davidson. It’s quite old now, I think it was written in about 1980, but it has recently been made into a film, so perhaps you will have heard of it.\n\nI was introduced to the book by an Australian friend. She was travelling to England when I met her, and we were both working at the same place. I said how brave she was going around the world, and how much I’d like to do it but I didn’t have the skills and courage to do the same. She insisted that bravery doesn’t really come into it, sometimes you just have to go. When she left to continue on her travels she gave me a copy of this book, with an inscription that was taken from its last chapter which basically says, the hardest part of any endeavour (or journey) is taking the first step, making the decision to go, and after that it’s easy!\n\nThe book is a true account of a young woman who decides to cross the Great Australian Desert on her own by camel! That is some 1700 miles of the Australian outback, from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean. What I found remarkable about the tale, is that the woman who does this is herself not that well equipped. She makes lots of mistakes, things go wrong, she loses confidence at times, and it is by no means easy. At the start of the journey, she’d never met a camel, let alone knew how to work with them! However, she overcame all these obstacles through tenacity and creativity and achieved her goal. It was precise because she was apparently so unsuited to the endeavour that I found it really inspirational to read. Sometimes you read tales of adventurers and the people who do great thing seem to be super-human, incredibly resourceful, strong or wealthy and you end up thinking ‘that’s amazing, but I could never do that’. With Robyn’s tale, it is different, you think ‘well if she can I could too. It won’t be easy, but it isn’t necessarily impossible either’.\n\nSo why is the book so important to me? Because it gave me a nudge to do something I’d been wanting to do for a very long time. To travel. The story inspired me, but also the confidence that my friend had in me that I could do it too helped me to eventually make the decision to go off exploring the world. Perhaps not anything quite so remarkable as crossing a desert on my own apart from a few camels, but my own adventures nevertheless. Since then I’ve found out for myself that it is indeed true, the hardest bit about any adventure is making the decision to take the first step. I wouldn’t say that after that it is necessarily easy, but I would say if you keep going forward you won’t want to look back!"

    "Answer": "I can remember many movies that I have enjoyed and which were actually based on books that I have read. One such book was ‘The Notebook’ which was written by Nicholas Sparks and later in 2004; a movie with the same title was released.\n\nI read the book in 2002 and thoroughly enjoyed it because of the attractive storyline. The Notebook was the first published book by Nicholas Sparks and because of the big success of this novel, the writer got internationally acclaimed. This book was published in 1996 by the Time Warner Book Group and got in the list of the New York Times best-selling books with in the first week of its release. I preferred the Book version of the story as it was touchier and more vivid than the movie version. The book tells the story in a tone that was not present in the movie. The movie-making was good as well but the story that I read was more enjoyable as I have read each line of the story and had the control how fast to read it, when to pause it and when to think about it.\n\nThe story of the book starts with an old man who reads a story to an old woman each day in a nursing home. The story he reads the woman was the story of Noah and Allie. After the 2nd World War, Noah came back and restored a house that made a piece of news in the newspaper. Allie read this news and gave him a visit. This was their second encounter after 14 years when at their adolescence time; they fall in love with each other. They were separated by the social class as Allie was the daughter of a rich man. In the second encounter with Noah, Allie felt that she still loves Noah but she also does not want to hurt her fiancé. At a later date, her mother arrives and hand over the letters of Noah that she never gave to her daughter. Allie started crying and left for her hotel when Noah tried to convince her to stay.\n\nThe old man who was telling the story was Noah and the old woman was Allie who had memory loss and did not recognise her husband. On a dinner, the old woman told him that Allie must have gone back to Noah and they are together now. Later on, Allie recognised her husband and could remember the past while in the nursing home and the story ends with the victory and joy of love. The writing quality, the storyline, the plot and other ingredients of the book were interesting and attractive. I personally enjoyed the book a lot."

    "Answer": "I am usually one of those people who like to remain satisfied with whatever little they have in their possession. So, every little thing I get in my life becomes an occasion of happiness for me. But, today, I would like to talk about an occasion which was no way a small one for me, when I was offered a handsome amount of money (at least “handsome” by my standard and expectation) by my parents to buy a small flat in my little home town about a few years ago.\n\nAgain, it was about a few years ago, and I had just managed to save up some money from my job in order to buy a small flat in my hometown. By the way, buying a new flat for me wasn’t exactly a matter of luxury for me. But, I decided to do so because I was living in a rather small flat with my parents, along with my elder brother, his wife and his two grown-up children. So, I felt that if I could move to my own flat, it would allow my entire family a little more space for living comfortably.\n\nBesides, if I could buy that flat, it would also become an asset for me in future. So, anyway, I told my parents about my intention, and they happily agreed with me. Of course, I also told them at the same time that I didn’t have enough money to buy the flat, I had chosen.  That was supposed to be the end of the story, but suddenly, a few weeks later, they offered me a paycheck of a certain amount of money, in order to help me buy the flat, with the money I had managed to save up before.   \n\nNeedless to say, I felt speechless with their act of generosity. In fact, I couldn’t believe that they would offer me their hard-earned money at an old age. But, at the same time, I also felt very happy and proud of my old parents who were still thinking about the well-being and happiness of their children."

Since the university is located in (...say a city name...) I would say this occasion took place there. I got admitted to this university in 2004 and I had to compete with several other students to be accepted. It is one of the most famous university and for a single position, more than 20 candidates compete. \n\nMy future career, what I will do, where I will be and what I will become would be shaped by this event. If I had been admitted to a different university in a different faculty, things in my life would have been different. That's why I consider this event as a very significant event in my life. When I came to get admitted to the university, my father was with me. \n\nAs I have already told this was a very important occasion in my life as it would shape my future and what I become. I felt very overwhelmed when I got admitted to this university. I felt proud to be allowed to study there, and my parents were very proud as well. I felt a bit sad that I would have to leave my family afterwards but I knew that was for a greater purpose. I felt that a different part of my life is going to start and I was determined to follow the right track with time."

    "Answer": "If one thing that has fascinated me from my early university years is the nature of international relationships among different countries in our world. No doubt, this is a very complicated subject, and the brightest of the minds are able to penetrate into it. On the other hand, I am not even remotely as bright as those people who handle this complicated job so well. But, that doesn’t prevent me from wising to become an International Relationship Expert in the future.\n\nSo, what does an \"international relationship expert\" and/or political analyst do, or what is so special about this job? Well, in plain English, he analyzes and interprets international policies, issues, legislation, as well as the activities of governments, businesses, and organizations overseas in order to forecast political, economic, and social trends. Now, of course, it sounds a bit too easy just from the sound of it, but, trust me, it isn’t that easy at all, and that’s exactly where it gets interesting.\n\nIn fact, a particular event or a political/economic development in a country can frustrate the entire plan or process to forge a mutually beneficial relationship among all countries. A miscalculation, wrong step or even some wrong choices of words can create tension or war-like situation. And, when situations become this messy or unpredictable, it is the experts on international and political affairs, who jump into actions to calm things down by putting matters into proper perspective, to maintain a steady and peaceful situation into our world.\n\nBy the way, it is not really easy to become an 'international relationship expert' because it requires extensive education with very good academic results and some solid work experience in the political field or internship in different international organizations which research on international politics.\n\nAnyway, I am interested in having this job in the future because there are just too much mistrust, hatred, competition and animosity, because of the conflict of interests, among the countries in the world, and I want to be able to minimize, if not completely erase, these conflicts for a better future of this world and our future generation."

    "Answer": "I am certainly not a “health-freak”, but I have some genuine interest in what we eat, and how our eating behaviour affects our overall health and moods. The issue becomes even more important when we see so many different kinds of food and snacks are flooded into our markets with a very little or no nutritional value.\n\nAnd, it is from this concern that I would like to take a course on improving nutrition and health if I ever have time in the future. This interesting course covers the aspects of biology, chemistry, and even physics to some extent, along with, of course, gaining an important insight of healthier eating, in order to teach us about six nutrients, called carbohydrates, fats, proteins, water, vitamins and minerals, that are needed for energy, maintenance of tissues and regulation of bodily processes. \n\nThis course would also help me understand how to read food labels, choosing healthier food, hydrating appropriately, and understanding how we should taste food so that we become more informed about the choices we make for the food we eat without spending too much time or money, or without running to a doctor.  This course would also investigate how information about healthy eating differs around the world. By the way, one can take this course from any local health institute or university. People can take this course also from online these days.\n\nAnyway, I want to do this course because there are a number of benefits to taking this course. It will allow us to consider the relationships between food and feelings and alternative routes to offer help and support to those who need it. This nutrition courses would also teach me how food, nutrients and health science can be used for medicinal and therapeutic effects – to prevent illness, like obesity, malnutrition and over-nutrition (yes, there is such a thing called “over-nutrition”) – especially after learning so much conflicting information about our food habits and diets.  Finally, I want to take this course also because it would allow me to become a registered fitness professional in the near future."

It is a combination of learning some theoretical aspect of graphics designing and then hands-on Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. These two are widely used image editing and graphics designing tools that emphasising on computer design and website designing. \n\nI would like to get admitted in (...say an institution name...) who offers a professional course on graphics designing. They have a good reputation for teaching the course participants accurately and effectively. Since I have offices/ classes till the evening, I would like to enrol in the evening course that starts after 7.00 pm. The course fee is reasonable and I would have the option to pay the fees in 3-4 instalments and that would be very convenient for me. \n\nThis should not be a very difficult course for me as I already have some background on computing and graphics designing. But I will have to concentrate on the course and maintain the regularity. This course would be a 6 months course and that's why I will have to adjust my time during this 6 months period. Another thing that required a course participant is to practice a lot. Since this is a creative task and the course teacher would show us how to do something, the course takers have to work hard to improve their skills and creativity. \n\nThis course would be helpful for me to do better in my career. Graphics design is required for many jobs and knowing it would be a great advantage for me. Besides, If I can become a prominent graphics designer, I would be able to work for clients from different countries as a freelancer besides my day job."

In fact, there are so many things in my life, I need to change, that I don’t even know where to start. But, to start with, it would be great if I could change myself to be a bit more proactive person.\n\nWell, yes, I am not shy to admit that I am a bit a lazy person. Well, on second thought, I am perhaps more than just a “little bit” of a lazy person, and I want to get rid of this ‘lazy me” as soon as possible. Let me give you some example of how lazy can I really become sometimes, especially, when I become a bit too busy and occupied with my job. For example, I don’t change my bed sheets or wash them for weeks if not months. Sometimes, when I feel exhausted, I don’t even care to change my clothes or shocks before going to bed when I come too late from work. And, I don’t even want to talk about how I “bother” my subordinates at work to do the little things for me, obviously, because I am too lazy to do them.  \n\nSo, I really want to change this dull aspect of my life, but I know that it isn’t going to be too easy at all since I have been like this since my early high school days. In fact, my grandparents spoiled me since the days they moved with me and my parents. In fact, they loved me so much that they wouldn’t even let me pour a glass of water myself, lest I would become too “tired” of working.\n\nAnyway, I would like to make this change because it is actually preventing me from enjoying a lot of things in my life because I am too lethargic to go out and explore the world. I would make this change also because people around me sometimes have a rather “negative” view of me, which can be equally embarrassing and frustrating."

But, unfortunately, we don’t always control the situations or things around us, and as such, we become late despite our best effort and intention, just as it happened last year ago when I was late to attend the marriage ceremony of my dear niece.\n\nAs I have already mentioned earlier that I always try to be on time, so, it was quite natural for me to take all the precautions to arrive at the marriage ceremony of my niece well in advance of the schedule.\n\nBy the way, my niece lived in a small city which was about a couple of hundred kilometres from where I used to live. And, unfortunately, there was no flight from my home town to her small city, and I couldn’t take an aerial route to travel to her. Instead, I chose an express (or ‘fast”) train. But, after travelling for about an hour, I noticed that the train was travelling at almost half of its regular speed, apparently, because some kind of emergency repairing works with the train lines was going on ahead of us. Initially, I thought that it wouldn’t take much longer to fix it, but as another half an hour passed, I started to worry about arriving on schedule. Needless to say, I felt very frustrated as I could very well sense that I wouldn’t be able to arrive at the wedding ceremony of my beloved niece on time.\n\nAnyway, even though, I felt very frustrated and helpless in that situation, I knew that it was not going to help me. So, I immediately decided to call my niece and explained her the situation and told her to go ahead with the ceremony without me while also telling her that my love and prayer would always be with her. And that I would meet her at the happiest moment of her life as soon as I arrive in her city."

    "Answer": "The city I live in has a severe traffic jam problem and due to that, we often get late to reach our destination. One such event when I was late in an important exam was a frustrating experience for me. It was 2 years ago when I was a student at the university. I had an exam at 8.30 am which I thought would be at 9.30 am. I did this mistake because I noted the time wrongly in my notebook. I prepared for the exam well and left home at 8.15 am as my usual journey to my university takes around 40 minutes. According to the schedule, I should have reached at least 30 minutes before the exam time.\n\nI already had the wrong idea about the exam timing and I found that it was raining outside and there were only a few transportations available on the road. I had to wait at the bus stoppage for more than 30 minutes before I actually got into a bus. To my surprise, the traffic on the road was very bad. The buses were moving very slowly because of the unavoidable traffic jam. I was hoping desperately to reach the university on time. But that was not my day! I reached the exam hall at 10.15 am and I was shocked to learn that the exam would end only in 15 minutes. I was so worried and anxious that I could not think clearly what to do.\n\nI felt helpless at that time and was asked the teacher what can I do now. He asked me to come after the exam ends. I followed him as soon as he left the exam room. I noticed that some of my classmates were also looking at me with surprise and were probably thinking about how careless I was to miss such an important exam.\n\nAfter I reach the class exam coordinator’s room, he took me to our advising tutor and asked me to give a good reason why I was late for the exam. I told everything that has happened and the coordinator arranged an exam in his room. As a penalty, he deducted 20 minutes from the exam time and asked me to finish the exam and leave the answer sheet to him. I was kind of worried and felt a bit relieved also. As my preparation was good, I had been able to answer all the questions in due time. Thus the situation was handled and I was not in big trouble for the late I made unintentionally."

    "Answer": "I have watched many movies, supposedly based on real events. No doubt, some of those movies were really good because of their distinctive visual appeals, narratives and other reasons while some of them were “so-so”. However, today, I would like to talk about a movie which I consider to be one of the best war films, I have ever seen.\n\nThe name of this movie is “Black Hawk Down”.  This war film was made in the year of 2001, based on the 1999 non-fiction book of the same name by journalist Mark Bowden, about the U.S. military's 1993 raid in Mogadishu.  The movie tells a story about a US military operation, which took place in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October of 1993, in order to deliver U.N food shipments, by preventing the Somalian warlords. But the military raid went disastrously wrong, when optimistic plans ran into unexpected resistance, resulting in the loss of 18 US soldiers and wounding more than 70 of them.\n\nWhat actually happened was that enemy rockets, launched by Somalian warlords, brought down two of the US helicopters.  Anyway, after watching the movie a couple of times carefully, because I really like it, I felt that no army, even if they are as great as the US army, would be able to take on its enemy successfully if they don’t have the resolve to risk their lives. After all, an army, which leaves their night vision gears, thinking that they would get back to their base within a few hours after successfully completing their military raid, planned nothing but some disastrous ending.  \n\nAnyway, I think that it is a good movie because it is made subtly differently, where no one person is clearly singled out as a hero, unlike many other war movies we see. I also like the fact that the movie doesn’t make any effort to cheapen itself by putting unnecessary weight into one particular moment. Finally, I think that the movie also has slick cinematography, good visual effects and believable action (as opposed to some “super-human” ones). All in all, it is a great movie."

The movie was directed by Ron Howard and he was inspired to make the movie from a book of the same title.\n\nThe famous actor Russell Crowe acted as the main character of the movie and won the Oscar for the best actor. The story of the film depicts the life, work and thinking of a young prodigy called John Nash who developed \"paranoid schizophrenia\" after he joins the secret cryptography work. The true genius, the talented and gifted person who had difficulties separating the hallucination and reality worked towards defining the mathematical relationship that changed the world. Nash lived two separate lives and one was in his mind while the other one was the real one. This film portrayed the life and work of a genius who had some mental illness and yet contributed to the betterment of the world.\n\nThe movie told us the story of John Nash who is an interesting person in terms of his genius and talent. The acting, the production and presentation of the movie was extraordinary. It was so nicely presented and acted that the majority of the critics gave a positive review of this movie just after it was released."

It becomes even more interesting when without gravity, a person (an astronaut that is) can grow up to three per cent taller if he/she spends at least 6 months on the international space station. Now, please tell me how many cooler jobs are there in the world which can help you grow three per cent taller in six months?! Well, the answer is “none”.\n\nI guess, it should be clear by now that becoming an astronaut was my dream job, especially after watching “the star trek” TV series, when I was young, except of course I had no clue at that time that it could actually help me grow three per cent because the absence of gravity helps expand our spine if I had somehow managed to spend at least 6 months in the space station. \n\nAnyway, there are many other cool things about being an Astronaut. But, first, let me tell you who exactly an astronaut is. Well, Astronauts gather information about the space in general by conducting experiments with the spacecraft itself to develop new concepts in design, engineering, and the navigation of a vehicle outside the Earth's atmosphere. However, it is not easy to become an astronaut because one has to have at least a Bachelor degree in science and at least 1,000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. He/she would also need to meet a minimum physical requirement as far as his height, visual acuity and blood pressure are concerned, specified by NASA.\n\nAnyway, being an astronaut was my dream job as a young because I was always fascinated by the vast empty space around us and how it affected our life on this earth. Besides, the idea of becoming an astronaut always gave me a feeling of tremendous adventure as far as the possibility of going to new worlds and walking on land there where nobody has been before. Besides, how cool would that be if having a job would allow someone to become an explorer, scientist, engineer, and pilot, all in one, at the same time!"

In fact, becoming a pilot, who flies commercial aeroplanes, was my dream in my childhood.\n\nI have heard about this job from my teachers and relatives in my childhood and then I had a superficial idea about this job. When I was 15 or 16 years old, I saw a documentary on the tasks the pilots do on the Discovery channel that gave me a clear idea of the jobs of a commercial aeroplane pilot.\n\nWorking as a pilot requires comprehensive training and to become a good pilot one needs very good quality and skillsets. Usually, the commercial airline companies hire the candidates and then give them comprehensive training, both theoretical and practical, and after particular hours of flawless flying records, the candidates are sent to work for their jobs. The theoretical parts teach them the different aspects of flying, route, safety and process guidelines where the practical parts allow them to actually fly a real aeroplane. They need to prove that they have gained sufficient skills to fly a commercial plane before they are appointed to do the job.\n\nI was a fascination with flying the aeroplane in the sky. It was a thrilling job for me when I was young. Since different people of the family members started giving me the idea of good careers and what I would become in the future, I started speculating my own idea and I found the job of a pilot very exciting and prestigious. I knew that being a pilot would allow me to visit different countries across our boundaries and would allow me to meet different people and these 2 ideas also attracted me toward this job. For all those reasons it was my dream job when I was young."

So, the other day, when I was visiting one such handicraft store, I saw a very beautiful looking wooden flower base, and I wanted to buy it for my room except, of course, it was a bit too expensive for me. Suddenly, an idea hit me, and needless to say, I liked it.\n\nI wanted to make my own flower base out of wood just like the one I saw at the store, but I just didn’t know what kind of wood or material was used to make it. But, I am assuming that it was made out of some expensive wood because it looked extraordinarily beautiful and polished.\n\nSo, I decided to choose my own material – I chose bamboo. But, it wasn’t exactly easy to find the best quality bamboo in where I lived, so I travelled to a bamboo garden at a distant area in order to find a perfectly round shape bamboo which was green in colour, and it was really hard. After bringing that bamboo, I cut it into some evenly-sized thin slices. If I remember it correctly, I believe that I made about 10 slices which were about 1 foot high each. After that, I connected their edges with each other with some strong glue to give them a round shape with about a 6-inch hollow space at the centre around them. In no time, I saw that my flower vase was getting shape. So, I decided to close one pole of my newly-made flower vase after painting it with my favourite golden colour in order to hide some unwanted spots on it.  \n\nAnyway, after making the flower vase, I felt surprisingly proud of my achievement because I did it with my own hands and by using my own technology. But, the best thing about it was that it didn’t actually take me much time nor did I have to spend a fortune to make my beautiful looking flower base."

But the price was too high for me and I did not ask my parents to buy it for me as I knew that it was very expensive. A few days later after my 5th-grade final exam, I went to visit my grandfather’s house and planned to make a boat similar to the boat I saw in the store. The original boat that I saw was made of metal and plastic but I planned to make one using the board, wood. The plan came to my mind as the woods and boards were available in my grandfather’s house.\n\nI started making the boat from my memory and found that I was making the wrong one and I won’t be able to make the boat that I planned. I made a sketch and then started building the parts. This time I was successful and I had been able to make a nice looking boat. Later I coloured it and wrote my name on it. This was a fascinating experience as it was the first time I made something from wood and board. Before that, I mostly made toys from papers and after I made the boat, I showed it to everyone. I was very excited to have it and I was proud that I had been able to make it. I had this toy with me for one year or so this was a toy that inspired me to make some other toys that I made later on."

Of course, there is nothing wrong with moving to a new place if there are some valid reasons for it.  \n\nBut, as far as my friend was concerned, he was already living in a nice and spacious flat in a rather open area, which was adjacent to a beautiful lake and lots of greeneries. And, if I remember correctly, I never found him to be complaining anything about the residence or place he was living in except some occasional and mild complain that he needed to travel a long distance to arrive his office and come back to home from there. In fact, according to him, spending one hour on the road every day was a bit too much for him, so it was important for him to move close to his work, which, by the way, would be a crowded city and full of pollution. Of course, I tried to convince him not to move because I knew how much he enjoyed nature at his old place. But, he seemed determined on his decision to move close to his job.\n\nI think that moving out of his old place was a wrong decision, primarily because, in my opinion, he always had found the extra energy there to do more things and become more productive there. After all, he was living in a place which was surrounded by some beautiful nature. Besides, moving to a busy city was always going to be more expensive than living in a suburb.

Today, I would like to share with you one such success story.\n\nAnyway, to tell the story, as a young person, especially in my early high school days, I just loved eating all kinds of cakes. In fact, I was eating those cakes, especially the chocolate ones, and wondering how people could make such wonderful and delicious cakes!\n\nSometimes, I even used to ask myself if I would also ever be able to bake such delicious cake one day while also giving it a try at my home at times despite the vehement objection of my mother. By the way, her strong opposition to my cake baking venture was not misplaced because every time I used to try baking a cake in her kitchen, I would make a complete mess out of her whole kitchen.  \n\nThen, one day, I decided that I would enrol at a culinary school to learn about cake baking. Initially, my parents just laughed off my idea because they thought that it would be just some waste of time. But, I was adamant about perfect cake baking learning techniques and skills. Finally, after attending the culinary school for a good 6 week period of time, I succeeded in becoming a champion in a cake baking competition, organized by the institute. Of course, it wasn’t easy, but I enjoyed every minute of the competition and the associated success.\n\nAnyway, this success was a really important one for me because it was a great confidence-booster for an average student like me. In fact, after that success, I felt that I could do much better at my school. Besides, it also gave me an idea on how to become a successful entrepreneur because, later on, after finishing university, I started a small business also along with continuing my full-time job."

    "Answer": "The success I think I am proud of is my outstanding performance in the board final exam that I attended many years back. I got the highest mark in our locality and because of that I got many congratulations and this success story was reported in the local newspaper.\n\nIt was the year 2002 (...say a year that suits you...) when I passed my school board final exam. I can't recall the exact month the result was published but that would be either January or February.\n\nSince this \"success\" or \"achievement\" was a part of my academic study and exam, and not related to any extracurricular activity, I would say it happened naturally and I had no involvement in choosing it. To say more specifically, if someone achieves some successes in photography or in art, s/he has some history how and why she came to photography or art, what was the motivation etc. but for me that success was an academic success and I did not have to choose anything. I needed to study attentively, though. I followed a rigid study routine for a couple of years and that helped me achieve this success. I would say that it was easy to achieve as I had a planned routine that I followed and I enjoyed reading my academic lessons. I have devoted a great deal of time reading academic books, reference books, different magazines related to subjects, took note, did group discussions and other activities and all those activities helped me to achieve this success.\n\nThis was an important success for me as it highly inspired me to do better in my further academic years. This success gave me the impression that if I can do better, my hard work would be rewarded accordingly and I would be in a better position in my future. Thus this success inspired me to achieve the next success."

    "Answer": "I love food, so it is hard to think of just one favourite sort of food!  However, if I had to choose, I can think of something that I like to have as a special treat from time to time.  I’m going to tell you what the food item is, how it is made, why I like it so much and explain to you what makes it my favourite food and maybe even convince you that you would like it just as much as well – if you haven’t already discovered it for yourself.\n\nThe food is quite simple.  I’ve always thought of it as a Greek speciality, although others tell me it actually originates from Egypt.  Can you guess what it is?  Houmous.   I love it.  The food is spelt differently in American English – they call it hummus and in British English, we spell it with an ‘o’ and a ‘u’ as opposed to just the ‘u’ but the recipe is the same in either case.\n\nBasically, it is made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. It is popular throughout the Middle East (including Turkey), North Africa (including Morocco), and in Middle Eastern cuisine around the globe, but it is also extremely popular with me, although I’m very particular about the sort I buy.  I live near a wonderful delicatessen, it is run by a friendly couple, he is Italian and she is vintage Yorkshire.  They make their own houmous with only the finest quality virgin olive oil and huge quantities of the best fresh garlic they can get hold of.  It’s pretty expensive, but I love it, and it’s better than my own attempts for some reason, I don’t know why it shouldn’t be so hard to make.\n\nWhy do I like it?  I think it is partly the texture, and partly the taste, I love garlic.  Also, because I’m vegetarian it is a very healthy food, with lots of protein and quality fats that are good for you.  Of course, you can have too much of a good thing, but I think it’s well worth it.\n\nIt is my favourite food not only because it is absolutely delicious, but also because you can share it with other people.  It is best eaten as a dip, with friends.  I cut up lots of carrots, cucumber and celery into crudités carefully sliced to make a colourful dish, perhaps with some slices of warm pitta bread too.  A nice bottle of white wine helps.  We can then all sit together enjoying the fresh humous dip, sipping our glasses of wine and laughing and talking to put the world to rights.  It is a great way to enjoy a fabulous food item."

    "Answer": "I have a number of favourite food items that I like to eat. While some of these food items, which are my favourite, are cooked with traditional recipes, others are cooked by using unconventional recipes and methods. However, today, I would like to talk about a food item which is cooked in a traditional manner.\n\nThis favourite food item of mine is called “Hilsha fish curry”. Hilsa (or Ilish) curry is the national dish of Bangladesh, made from the Hilsa fish, and is one of the most popular traditional Bangladeshi dishes. In Bangladesh, it is common to eat every part of the Hilsa fish, including the head and the eggs. In fact, nothing is wasted as each and every part of this fish has its own unique delicacies. One can find fish egg dishes or fish head curries that are widely revered throughout the entire country.\n\nBy the way, this particular food item is very popular in many parts of India as well except that they have their own Hilsha fish to fry. In fact, Indian people sometimes rely on the export of this delicious fish from Bangladesh. Anyway, the ingredients, used to prepare this dish, are Hilsa fish, salt, turmeric powder, black cumin seeds, green chillies, mustard oil, and water. Mustard oil and black cumin seeds are also significant in the preparation of this dish, depending on what kind of taste one really prefers. But, in order to cook this delicious food item, one first needs to marinate the Hilsha fish in turmeric and chilli paste before slowly frying it on a low heat and serving with mustard gravy and steam rice. The result is a combination of sweet and sour flavours with an incredible spicy kick.\n\nAnyway, it is my favourite food item because Hilsa curry is filling, flavoursome, and easy to make. Besides, it is also widely available throughout the entire country, especially, during the rainy season.  Finally, it is my favourite also because it is the only authentic “Bengali” curry that can be served on all occasions."

    "Answer": "My favourite food is fried rice with vegetable and chicken curry with salad. This is, in fact, the most popular menu in our country. The rice is first boiled in water and then the boiled rice is fried with some chicken and vegetables and oil. The chicken curry is prepared separately using some spices and chicken and finally, the salad is prepared using different vegetables and fruits and then those are cut into pieces and mixed together with mustard. Then these three items are served together.\n\nI eat this menu approximately 3-4 times a week. This menu is prepared at home mostly and sometimes I eat it in a restaurant. There are some variations in the way this food is prepared and the ingredients using which this food is made. Different restaurants have their own speciality in preparing and serving this menu.\n\nThis is my favourite food for many reasons: firstly it is very delicious and healthy. This menu meets the demand for different food values our body needs. It is available in most of the part in our country. Thirdly, I like it as it offers variations of tastes. Moreover, it is not that much expensive to prepare and does not require o much effort to prepare. For all these reasons it is my favourite food."

    "Answer": "Time flies really fast, and the event, that took place a year ago, seems like happened only a week ago or so. In fact, I can still vividly remember the day when I celebrated a happy new year with all of my family members about a few years ago.\n\nHowever, before that day though, I and my family had wanted to celebrate a happy reunion of the entire family for quite some time, but it just didn’t happen because both my elder brother and sister were not able to make them available because they both used to live quite far away from me and my parents due to their professions. But, we saw a great window of opportunity to have a family celebration as soon as a new year was about to arrive as both of my elder brother and younger sister confirmed that they would visit us on the eve of New Year and spend a few days with us.\n\nAnyway, since it was a rare opportunity, we all wanted to make our family reunion a memorable one by celebrating a happy new year together at a nearby restaurant. So, on the eve of New Year, we all went to the restaurant and ordered our favourite foods, that I and my other siblings used to like in our childhood, and desserts. By the way, the idea of our favourite foods from our childhood came from my loving mother, and we all liked it so much. Once, our food fests were over, we decided to head to our home and watch some of our old family videos in order to revisit our lovely and happy past as children. At the end of our reunion, I felt like the celebration was long overdue as we all enjoyed our time to the fullest.\n\nAnyway, it was really important for me and my family to attend this celebration because it helped us understand the value of my family like never before. Besides, it also gave us an opportunity to relax and have some fun with the entire family after a tiring and long work year."

    "Answer": "I often visit my hometown where my parents and other family members live whenever there are occasions or I get holidays. I would like to talk about my younger sister’s birthday celebration that I attended one year back. It was strictly a family celebration like no other relatives, neighbours were invited and only our family members celebrated this occasion.\n\nBefore the celebration, my mother and the younger sister asked me if I would be able to join the party or not. Since it was just the beginning of my semester, I had been able to manage time to attend the occasion.\n\nThe celebration took place at our house at (…say your hometown's name...). This was a kind of family reunion and the occasion was my younger sister’s 16th birthday. I was excited to join the celebration as all of my family members including the newborn of my eldest sister would also be there. It had not been able to visit my family for a few months and that was a perfect opportunity to meet my family members and spend some enjoyable and quality times with them.\n\nI was thinking to buy a digital camera to my younger sister and that was a perfect occasion to buy her the gift as I had the budget to purchase the camera. I bought it before I left home and my sister was very excited to have it as her birthday gift. Celebrations like birthdays are always important in our family as it allows us to get together and spend a few days together. As two of my sisters were married and lived in two different cities, they also attend such occasions and we all enjoy our stay together. From this perspective, this was an important occasion for us."

    "Answer": "I have heard about a number of children’s stories before from my grandparents and my parents as a child.  Anyway, while all of those stories were interesting in some ways, I can’t really remember any of them that well except only a few, and I would just like to tell about one of those few stories today here.\n\nI heard the story for the first time from my grandmother about 20 years ago.  The story was about a horse which was born and raised in the house of a landlord a long time ago.  The landlord and his entire family loved the horse very dearly.  By the way, they loved the horse because it was very loyal.  Suddenly, on an early morning, the landlord saw no horse in his barn, when he was going to let his loyal animal out of his horse barn.  The horse owner looked everywhere in his house and the rest of the areas in his village, but no trace of the horse was to be found anywhere. Actually, the horse got stolen and that’s why it was not to be found anywhere.  Needless to say, every member of the landlord’s family felt very sad and mourned for days.  However, after a few months, when they almost forgot about the horse, it suddenly showed up in his barn of the landlord.  The entire family of the landlord rushed to the stable and found that their beloved horse was standing in their barn while both eyes of the horse were full of tears.  Seeing the horse crying, every family member of the landlord became very emotional.\n\nAnyway, I remember the story because it showed some rare but true loving bond between an animal and his caretaker as the horse was finally able to escape from his captivity and find its way back to the place of his old owner to reunite with him even though, the animal was kept hidden hundreds of miles away from his original shelter.  Besides, the tears in the eyes of the horse, after reuniting with his old owner, were indeed a very touching moment for anybody who loves animals."

    "Answer": "The first children’s story I can think of is one that I doubt you will know. It was one of my absolutely favourite stories when I was little, and I just assumed everyone else knew it too. As I’ve got older I’ve never met anyone else who read it, I feel you have all missed out, maybe by talking about it to you today you will one day seek it out and read it for yourself.\n\nI’m going to tell you what the story is, when I first read it and why I didn’t just like it but loved it so much. As to why it became popular? Well it is a mystery to me why it isn’t more widely known, but I can tell you why I think it is so charming, and I’ll give you a bit of an overview of the story too, it’s quite simple. I might tell you that early on actually, as then you will understand why I liked it so much and why I think it is so appealing.\n\nThe story is called ‘The story of Ferdinand’, it’s by someone called Munro Leaf, and I first came across it as a little paperback with a bright orange cover. It hasn’t got very many words, but it is illustrated with beautiful black and white line drawings by someone called Robert Lawson. I don’t remember how I came to have the book, it must have been a present from someone, and I was very little when I first read it. Maybe around five year’s old, although I can’t be sure.\n\nThe story nearly broke my heart when I was little! It is the tale of a bull called Ferdinand that was bred to fight in Spain. I couldn’t believe that such a cruel sport existed, and it was terrible to me that this little bull was to be forced to battle. The story was how he never liked to fight. He was a peaceful bull, who preferred to sit smelling the flowers and keeping out of trouble. Whilst his more volatile companions practised putting their heads together he would find a shady spot to sit and ponder. One day some important people came to the field where he was living to choose a ferocious bull to fight in the bullfights in Madrid. Ferdinand did not want to be picked, so he snuck quietly away.  However, disaster! He sat on a bee, and the bee stung him. Ferdinand leapt up in surprise and started to buck and plunge about because he was in so much pain. The people think he must be a very rough and tough bull indeed and take him away to fight… When he gets to the bull ring it is awful. People want to fight and kill him. I was so upset at what might happen to poor Ferdinand! The matadors parade in, they prepare to taunt and spike him with spears. Then Ferdinand is brought into the ring. However, he refuses to fight, he sits in the middle of the arena and quietly smells the flowers in the lovely ladies’ hair. In the story, because he refuses to fight, they eventually take him home, and he is left to sit happily under his favourite cork tree smelling flowers for the rest of his life… I have a horrible feeling that isn’t what would really have happened!\n\nThe story is completely charming. The peaceable bull character that doesn’t quite fit in with his friends is easy for a child to relate to. The story is simple to understand. There is peril (that Ferdinand will be forced to fight and could be hurt and killed) but fortunately, there is a happy ending. The illustrations are simple but delightful. Some of the pictures are quite comical too, the angry matador cries and stamps his foot because he couldn’t show off with his cape and sword. The text is very straightforward too, just a sentence on each page, with the facing page full of the illustrations. It was a book I could read and understand myself from an early age. I think it’s a wonderful story – I still get a lump in my throat remembering it now.\n\nI really don’t know how someone found the book for me, and I am at a loss to explain why it isn’t more widely known. I’m sure if it had been more available it would have been (and still be) incredibly popular with younger readers and their parents. I still have a copy of the book. It isn’t my original one, I lent that to someone and never got it back. I was heartbroken. I feel quite sentimental about the tale and couldn’t bear to be without it, so I ended up trying to get a new copy. I found then that it was long out of print, so I ended up buying a ‘new’ second-hand version on Amazon or eBay or something. It isn’t the same, but I was glad to have a copy back in my possession. Look out for it if you can, I wonder if you will like it too, or whether you have to be six or under to really appreciate it!"

    "Answer": "In my childhood, I have heard lots of fables, stories and true stories which I still recall. Some of them were so exciting that they thrilled me in my childhood. One such story that I still remember is a fable of a king and a giant ghost.\n\nI heard this story from my grandmother for the first time and it was so exciting that I requested my grandma over and over again to tell this very story. I liked the excitement and twist of this story. As a kid, I was interested to know about the ghost, the kingdom and the kings and this story told the power of a king, about his kingdom, his queen, a ferocious ghost and the fighting between the humans and ghosts. This was a story taken from the fables written by one of the famous fable writer in our country almost 200 years ago. Thus people have read this story ad have told or heard this from others. Over time, this has become a story that passed from generation to generation. Thus it has become a widely popular story in our country.\n\nThe story starts with a wise king who was a kind and helpful king of the country. But he had no child who would lead the country after his departure. Thus the king became unhappy and thus the people of the country became greatly sad for their future. One dervish was passing the country and he was deeply touched by the kindness and people’s love for the king while most other kings in the world were feared by the people. He had some divine power a very great dervish and he blessed the king to have a child. But there would be a test for the king at a time of his life. The king was blessed with a beautiful and intelligent baby boy and the people of the kingdom became happy.\n\nThe boy became 7 years old when there was a great fight among the ghosts of the other world and a large portion of them was cast away from their world. They choose the world and particularly the kingdom of this kind king to have their living land. They came and started frightening and harming people of the kingdom. The king declared war against those evil spirits and won the fight with the bravery of the people of the country as well as the soldiers. But to everyone’ surprise the son of the king was missing and the ghost after their defeat left a message that they have captured the boy and would give him back only if the people and the king abandon the kingdom and let them reign there. That was a very difficult test for the king as well as the people of the country. The king then vowed to defeat the ghosts without harming the people of the kingdom. He left the country and the story went on. He had to face lots of tests and thus he gained powers of e truly divine person. Thus he started his tour to the place the ghost captured his son. The story has a lot more other interesting parts and twists and finally, the kind had been able to rescue his son after 10 years.\n\nAs a kid, the story was so appealing to me and I enjoyed the storytelling every time I heard it from my grandma."

    "Answer": "Historical places always intrigue me, as they almost always carry some kinds of special memories and messages in order to help us understand and respect the people of different eras, which significantly shape up our world one way or another. Today, I would like to talk about one such historical place which probably holds more significance in our part of the world called “India” than any other places because of its devastating political, economic and geographical effects.\n\nThe name of this historical place is called “Palashi”, anglicised as Plassey, which is located in Nadia district in the Indian state of “West Bengal”. It is particularly well known due to the Battle of Plassey which was fought in June 1757, between the private army of the British East India Company and the army of the last independent king of the then undivided Bengal called Nawab Siraj Ud Daulah.\n\nBy the way, the name “Palashi”, the name of a village on the bank of a river called “Hooghly”, is derived from the Bengali word for a red-flowered tree named “Pôlash” (but “Butea” in English”).  Anyway, this is the place which witnessed the monumental betrayal of a Bengali army general called “Mir Jafar Ali Khan”, working under king Siraj Ud Daulah, which eventually led to the defeat of a 50000 strong army men of the kingdom of Bengal against an army of only 3000 soldiers, led by an English Lieutenant-general called Robert Clive. By visiting this great historical place, one can see the monument, commonly known as “Palashi” Monument, which is marked with shrines, obelisks and memorials to the fallen generals and soldiers of Siraj Ud-Daulah, who fought to their deaths to save their last independent king.  \n\nAnyway, this is a very significant and interesting historical place, mainly because it was from the war victory of this place that the British were able to establish their reign all over the Indian subcontinent slowly but surely. Besides, this place also provides a glimpse of a very glorious and rich past of a nation which still hasn’t fully recovered from the setback of a devastating defeat more than 250 years ago."

    "Answer": "Machu Picchu in southern Peru is a very interesting historic place and I have a great interest in his historic place. Though I have not visited this place in person, I would definitely love to be there someday. I mostly learned about this place from one of my friends who visited there and from TV, internet and newspapers.\n\nMachu Picchu is located in Machupicchu District in southern Peru and it is historically connected with the 15th-century Inca civilisation. It is located in 2,430 meters or around 7,970 feet area above the sea level. This place lies on top of a mountain and is a very popular destination for tourist all around the world. This place is referred to as the \"Lost City of the Incas\" and it was named as one of the 7 wonders of the world in 2007. UNESCO nominated it as a world heritage in the year 1983.\n\nThis historic place was built as an estate for the Pachacuti emperor of the Inca civilisation in around 1450 and is considered as the most significant and familiar icon of the Inca civilisation.\n\nA tourist can see the finest work of the Inca civilisation there and can learn many things about this civilisation. Apart from the ruins and cultural icons, one can enjoy the great beauty surrounding this place. The sunset time is awesome and eye-witnessing the hills is something unforgettable. The Inca bridge is interesting to hike, and the scattered stones in the place is a different experience one can get. The Condor, Steps, Falling stairs, Temples, Sacred Rock, Llamas and other Animals, Inca Trail will all blow your mind and would remind you that you are visiting one of the 7 wonders of the world.\n\nThis is an interesting place due to the vast area and iconic meaning of the Inca civilisation. There is a lot to see, a lot to do and enjoy and being at one of the 7 wonders of the world is something a visitor will never forget. This place takes us to the past, in the time when Inca nation was there and taught us how advanced they were as they have been able to build such a place with virtually no technological advancement of modern technology."

    "Answer": "An interesting historic place in my country is (...say the name of a historic place...). It is situated at (...area name...) in (...city/town name ...). In my opinion, this is a very interesting historic place as it is almost two thousand years’ old and it was discovered in the middle of the last century. This was the centre of the (...say a civilisation name...) civilisation and was one of the most prominent cities of our country. More than several hundred feet had to be dug to discover it.\n\nNow the place has been renovated to reflect the city it once been. There are more than a hundred acres of land on this site and most of them are the remaining of the lost civilisation and city of that time. There are several old buildings, castles, fortress, monuments, rivers, canon, cryptic houses, under paths and sculptures are there. A museum was built as recently as 10 years ago for the visitors to learn more about this lost city and people. The museum is a really good one in terms of its collection and reflection of that civilisation.\n\nTo me, this was interesting because of the proof of advancement this civilisation had. I have read a lot about this civilisation and cultures of these people and visiting this place was a really good experience. The museum was very rich in terms of learning history. The city was more than 2 thousand years old and yet it has many amazing artworks, tools, intricate designs, buildings with amazing work, finest canon and many more proofs of their advancement. They had been a flourishing civilisation that dominated that part of the country. The idea of our civilisation being found by future generation was an interesting idea and this historic place just reminded me that. The museum, the fine airmanship and advancement of that civilisation are all amazing historic proof and interesting to explore."

    "Answer": "I’m not sure I have just one favourite colour, but if you insist on making me choose I know which one it would be. I’m going to tell you what it is, why it is significant and as far as I can how it is I started to like it. I’ll try and explain why I like the colour so much, but that might be hard to do – liking a particular colour is, after all, a very personal thing.\n\nMy favourite colour is blue! That doesn’t seem quite enough to say. There are so very many variants of the colour. Sky blue; sea blue; azure blue; navy blue; royal airforce blue; midnight blue; cobalt to name but a few. Then there are all those colours that are sort of blue, but tip over into green as well like turquoise or teal. To make it even more complicated there are rich blues that might almost be purple like the colour of the iris flower in my country. If you go to a DIY store and pick up a colour chart for different paints I expect there are hundreds if not thousands of ways to describe the colour blue – and I don’t even know if we all see the colour in the same way. It is mind-boggling!\n\nI don’t know quite what the significance of the colour is, but I find it a really attractive hue. In nature, I love a clear blue sea or the complex blues of a sky. Moody grey-blue before a storm, dark midnight blue at dusk or bright blue littered with fluffy white clouds on a summer day. As a child, I pronounced at an early age that blue was my absolute favourite colour. I think I did it partly to be different, most girls were expected to like pink but I wanted to dissociate myself from that and stubbornly declared a preference for blue, traditionally a boy’s colour. We used to go for walks from my first school in a big crocodile of children. We each held on to a coloured ribbon that was attached to a long piece of rope, accompanied by two teachers, one leading at the front of the rope and a second walking at the back of the line to keep us all safe. My classmates would fight for the pink ribbon, but ‘my’ blue one was always free. That helped me feel an affinity for the colour from when I was very young.\n\nAs an adult I think the colour blue suits me to wear, particularly dark blues, I look positively ill in paler colours for some reason. I don’t know if that goes anyway to explain why I still like the colour so much, perhaps vanity is part of it. However, I think the main reason has to be that I associate blue with huge spaces, be that a great sea stretching out to the horizon or the sky opening away to infinity. Looking at that gives a sense of perspective, we are such tiny beings in a vast universe, what could be more impressive a colour than one that reminds us of that!"

    "Answer": "Up until recently, I never really cared to distinguish among any colours to be my most favourite or least favourite.  However, before several months, I had to change my mind after looking at a very beautiful painting work in blue colour.\n \nTherefore, I guess, it is fair to say that \"blue\" is my favourite colour these days.  Of course, I have liked some other colours also before here and there just for the sake of liking them because of my mood or different circumstances, but there is no doubt today that blue is my favourite colour, and it will probably remain so for a long, long time.\n\nSo, what is exactly so significant about this particular colour which I really like that much? Well, the answer is, it is the colour of the sky.  Now, if something as vast as the sky, which is towering our earth and universe, prefers its colour to be blue, then who am I really to like some other colours!  Sometimes, I also feel these days that our world and the things, especially the blue waters in the oceans, on it wouldn’t look as beautiful as they do without a beautiful blue sky over us.  On top of that, we can hardly associate anything negative with the colour blue.  Some people also suggest that we tend to become more creative and smart, more often than not, when we are surrounded by blue colour.  But, is there really any truth in this sort of suggestion? Well, it is hard to tell, but as far as I am concerned, when I am surrounded by blue, I feel more alive and energetic.\n \nAnyway, I like the blue colour because it makes me feel more alive, and it is easier on my eyes than any other colours.  Besides, I have a thing against “colour pollution”, and I think that blue colour is the only colour that doesn’t present any colour pollution within our environments and on our building structures, no matter how much of it we really use.  In fact, I have also found that actually more people like blue than disliking it."

    "Answer": "My favourite colour is green and I have loved this colour from my early childhood. Green is the colour of nature, liveliness, fertility and freshness. The first reason I like this colour is that nature bears this colour everywhere. There is nothing more beautiful than the vast green trees, green vista and fields. Green is the symbol of life and it represents safety. The colour green also represents good luck, health, tranquillity. This colour has long been a symbol of fertility and that's why once been used in the wedding gowns mostly in the 15th century. This colour is often used in decorating to show the calmness.\n\nIf we judge the colour green from the colour psychology perspective, we learn that green balances the heart and emotions and thus create the equilibrium in heart and brain. From the meaning of colour perspective, green is the symbol of growth, the colour of spring and symbolises renewal and rebirth. It is the sanctuary away from the complexity and stresses of the modern lives and the tranquillity of the calm, fresh and greener area.\n\nI have my wall painted in green colour and it is generally believed that green is an eye-friendly colour, unlike red. The mild green colour is a popular colour which does not look too violent or too dull. I liked this colour even in my childhood and that I can be sure of the dominant green usages in my childhood paints. My teachers sometimes laughed at my weakness in the green colour when I painted a green sun and green moon. I still remember I painted a green alien and that painting became very famous among our friends.  \n\nI am not quite sure how my fascination started growing in green colour but I guess I started liking this colour as I had spent my childhood in an area where green was the most dominating colour. This was the colour of nature and I was surrounded by the beauty of nature. I noticed in my childhood that green is the colour for living and yellow and red means dying, specifically for the trees and plants I had. Maybe this idea influenced my preference for colour. Maybe this choice is not directly related to any of my experience and reflected in a later stage as part of my individuality and personal preference. Whatever is the reason, I guess Green is a colour of profound importance and is my favourite colour."

    "Answer": "I hardly know or meet people who don’t like food. In fact, the idea of trying different kinds of food from different cultures and countries has become so popular among some people around the world that they don’t mind spending a lot of their time and money to learn about them. In fact, I also do the same, but I do it mostly by visiting some great cooking and food-related websites. Today, I would like to talk about one such website that I visit from time to time.\n\nThe address of this website is https://www.foodnetwork.com. As the name suggests, this is a food-related website, and I found about it about a few years ago when I was searching for some unique food recipes online, which I could use to cook some good dishes within a short period of time.\n\nBy the way, sometimes I just get bored of eating the same kind of food, so I look for new recipes so that my mother could try them sometimes to prepare some new but delicious meals.\n\nAnyway, the website contains recipes and food ideas pretty much from all over the world. The contents on the website are so unique and appealing that it would be almost impossible for someone to leave the website without having an urge to cook them sometimes on their own.  Besides, the images of different food dishes on this website are simply outstanding. In fact, just by looking at these pictures on this website, one would automatically feel the urge to go into a kitchen even if he/she never liked cooking in the past. The website also contains all kind of information as to what kinds of food is perfect for any possible occasions, a person could ever think of.\n\nAnyway, I find this website useful, mainly because it allows me to change my taste in foods without running to an expensive restaurant. Besides, it also allows me and my family to surprise our friends and relatives by serving them some unique dishes, when they expect them in the least, which makes me happy."

    "Answer": "I use the internet almost every day and if I make a list of useful websites, the list would be pretty long. I would like to talk about www.google.com website that I find very useful for me. Google.com is the most visited website in the world as well as the best search engine currently. It helps people to search for any query or search keyword they have. It searches websites, video, news, image, and information for the search keywords. The results are relevant and one gets enough information s/he is looking for from this website which mainly fetches information from all around the internet.\n\nI have first used this website in 2000 when I read an article in a computer magazine about this search engine website. Nowadays this website has become so popular that a 5 years kid from any part of the world knows about Google.\n\nThis website basically contains a search input box, different searching options like video search, image search, web search etc. advanced search options, some copyright and help links and 2 buttons to search. Since this website brings results from the World Wide Web, after we search for something, the results are shown as well on this website. This has become a very popular search engine because the result it shows serves the searchers' purpose.  \n\nFor more than a decade, I have been using this website to search for information I want or need. It can find search results virtually for anything someone searches. For me, this website is a great place to find information, references, academic books, story, news, websites and anything I wanted to know and find. This website is the gateway to other websites for me."

    "Answer": "I have been lucky to have many friends, especially, when I was growing up as a teenager as well as when became an adult. While I always cherish the friendship of all of those friends, who I met, I would like to mention specifically about one of them who was a great friend of mine as a teenager.\n\nHis name was Mesbah Bhatia, and I met him for the first time during a friendly football match between two local teams in our locality when I was still a high school student about 10 years ago.\n\nI think that his parents had just moved into our locality rather recently during that time, and he didn’t know too many people or friends to feel that he also belonged there. So, when we requested him to play for our team because one of our team members needed to leave the playground for some family reasons, he gladly agreed. Anyway, Mesbah was a friendly fellow, and later on, I also came to know that he was attending the same class as me, but he was going to a different high school. After playing a few football matches together, we soon became good friends of each other.\n\nSince we both were the same age, we both pretty much liked and cared for the same things. For example, he liked to ride his bicycle and so did I. Mesbah even liked to eat the same type of grilled fish like me. Of course, there were some significant differences between us also. For example, he was afraid of water but I wasn’t. Anyway, we liked to do a lot of things together, but we probably enjoyed watching action movies and shopping together the most.\n\nAnyway, this friendship was important to me as he would always encourage me to study harder. It was also important to me because I could trust him with anything. Finally, Mesbah was a helpful person, and he would never hesitate to help me with my homework, even when he was busy with his own."

    "Answer": "Whenever I think about my childhood friends, I recall many of them who had been very close to me. One such friend, about whom I would like to talk about, is Mark. He was a really good friend of mine. I met Mark when I was 6 or 7 years old. He was a kid from our neighbourhood and I met him for the first time in our garden. His family lived next to our house. I was with my father in the garden and then suddenly Mark appeared there and asked me if I live here. This is how we first met and then we spent almost 5-6 years together until his father was transferred to some other state.\n\nWe did lots of things together and at that time we were neighbours, classmates and good friends. We used to go to school together, played at our home, read and sometimes went to picnic together. We had many things in common; both of us like playing video games, reading stories, running in the field, stamp collecting, watching cartoons, animated movies and many other activities. Somehow I felt at that time that we have a similar taste of foods, clothing and views on different issues. At that moment this friendship was very important to me. We were like brothers and best friends. We had so many common interests and we enjoyed playing, studying and doing other stuff together. He was the only neighbouring kid who could easily spend time with me with the consent of my parents. My parents and Marks parents were like family friends and that's why we got the chance to spent time together.\n\nThis friendship is particularly important to me because I have lots of happy memories related to my childhood and had become an unrepeatable part of it."

    "Answer": "As far as I remember, the routine of waking up early in the morning, getting forced to eat boiled eggs during the breakfast and then getting ready to go to my elementary school started from the very early days of my childhood. But, if I ever ‘dared’ to miss any of these routine works, even if it was by mistake or a “childish negligence”, I had to ‘contend’ with a very strong, and yet, a very familiar “disciplinary lady voice” at my house to remain in strict compliance with the “routine” at all cost. Well, we can perhaps all guess who that “lady voice” might belong to.\n\nThat’s right… the voice belonged to none other than my own mother- the mother who carried me for more than nine months inside of her womb, fed me, clothed me, cleaned me, and comforted me when nobody else in this world would succeed in doing so.\n\nMy mother’s influence in shaping me as the person today I am. In fact, whatever I have learnt, and whatever I have achieved, so far in my life is contributed to my mother one way or another because of her “exemplary” mothering qualities. It is because of my mother that I learnt how to work as hard and relentlessly as I could and then “rising” again and again after failing. It is, in fact, my mother taught me how to take “bold” but “unpopular” decisions in life if the situation demands.\n\nI have never seen my mother in the past, along with my father, failing in “rising” against me to my absolute “disgust” and “discontent”, if I was ever committing anything wrong, only to find out later on that she would do it in the best interest of her loving child. And, as a result, this adult me, still to this date, “fears” for the “wrath” of his mother in case if I ever get caught up on the wrong side of a bargain in this rather complicated journey of life.\n\nMy mother also encouraged me not to go after “the luxuries and comforts” of life too much and “chase” human respect, instead.  And I can’t agree with her anymore on this, seeing how much I love and cherish the respects from another fellow human being, even though I may not have much “monetary success” in life. Finally, my mother was and still is a “strict” person with a bit “temper” because of working relentlessly to raise her family against many adversities, but I have never seen her failing in short when it came to showing the love for her family and children no matter how bad the situation is. And, it is because of my mother, I have learnt to appreciate love and family more than anything in this world."

    "Answer": "I can remember more than four or five persons who have made an unparalleled contribution to help me march forward in my life and inspired me to rise straight every time I fell. Among them my father’s contribution is unforgettable and I consider him the idol of my life. He is the person whom I love most in this world and I consider him to be a perfect human being with his uncompromised honesty, bravery and responsibility.\n \nI know my father from the very beginning of my life as he and my mother brought me into this world. From my childhood, he has raised me with his love, affection and mentorship. He taught me about the world - its magic and hardship, people and our relationship, and the importance of morality in life. He helped me with my education and has devoted his life to properly raise me.\n\nMy father is an exemplary person who has led an honest life. As a high ranking government officer, he had many chances to pile up the riches but he had always known what the right things to do. I have learnt how our character is more important than our wealth from him! He is now a retired person and leads his serene and peaceful like with contentment and happiness. He was and still is a brave person who never feared the rough power of society.\n\nAs a father, I would say he has done everything humanly possible to raise me and my three other siblings. He spent his entire earning for our happiness and necessity while he went through financial hardship. I learned the true meaning of life from him and have started achieving some of the qualities he has. The person who I am now is mostly because of my father's devotion and dedication. To me, he is an ideal person whom I often mimic and consider as my idol in life."

    "Answer": "This is such an interesting topic. In fact, I have met a number of polite persons in my life, and picking just one of them as the most polite person is not going to be an easy thing. But I will still go ahead and do that while also hoping at the same time that the others, I know as really polite persons, never hear this conversation! After all, I don’t want the rest to think that I don’t consider them as very polite persons!\n\nAnyway, the person, I want to talk about, was one of my former co-workers. His name was Sheikh Walid. I met Walid for the first time when he was introduced to us formally by our Senior Manager at my office. He joined in the same finance department as me as a Senior Budget Controlling Officer. Anyway, after starting working Walid, I noticed that he would never talk to me or any of his fellow workers without taking our permissions first. Initially, we found this particular habit of his to be a bit awkward, but as time progressed, we all realized that he was a polite person in nature.\n\nIn fact, I had never seen him eating his lunch without asking us to share his food with us first. He used to respect his Senior Manager as some “god” figures. In fact, he was so mild-mannered that even our Managing Director would never reprimand Walid because of work-related reasons. By the way, I enjoyed the company of Walid, as long as he was working with us, simply because he would never complain about anything even when he had ample amount of reasons to do so.\n\nI think that Walid was the most polite person, I have ever met because he not only greeted us first but also treated our families just like his own. Besides, the fact that he would never interrupt another person from expressing his or her opinion, even when the person was simply espousing hatred, went to show what kind of polite person Walid really was."

    "Answer": "I have met many persons with very polite behaviours and soft attitude and among them, my neighbour Mr Arun ( or ...say a name you like...) is the most polite person I have ever met. Interestingly he is very talented, well-mannered, possesses an extensive experience of travelling and he is a writer. There is a rumour that after his son died, he started living a discrete and solitary life.\n\nI first met him after he moved to our neighbourhood around 5 years back. One day I went to his home to give some homemade cookies and food for a major festival. The way he greeted me and thanked me was simply amazing. I was around 19-20 years old but he treated me as if I was a more matured and experienced person. I am at least 20 years junior to him and yet he showed me the utmost respect which is very rare nowadays.\n\nIn fact, he is well-known in our community as a perfect gentleman and a sober person. Almost every one of our locality likes him for his polite manner, serene life-style and his wit. I often visit his place and discuss many issues. He is a great problem solver and has a natural gift on Mathematics. He often helped me with my studies and we played table tennis, chess and other indoor games.\n\nThe most interesting part about him is that he is a brave person and he often protests the unfair issues of our community. But those are so natural and his way of presenting those issues are so important and obvious that people obey him and give great concerns on the issues he raises. Besides, people respect his judgments and good wills. I like spending time with him and enjoy his company. We all have our own perceptions about polite persons and in my opinion, he is a perfect example of how people can be earnest and polite being very brave, intelligent and righteous."

    "Answer": "There are a few interesting places in my hometown, I know of, which are open to the public pretty much throughout the entire year. But, I would like to go ahead and talk about the one that I like to frequently visit, probably because I find it more interesting than the others.\n\nIt is a public lake. Located in one of the rich neighbourhoods of my city, this public place is serving as a perfect and temporary getaway for the busy city dwellers of my hometown. Stretching as long as about 1 kilometre, this public lake has many trees on both sides, and under those trees, one would also get to see many small size kiosks, but with a rather large sitting arrangement around them, which are serving different kinds of snacks at an affordable price. If anybody wants to spend his or her time at the lake, just by reading some newspapers, there is some arrangement for that also as people could easily buy daily newspapers from the kiosks there also. People can rent a boat there also and ride it if they are in a mood to play a little with the water of the lake. There are even some small pockets of areas there, scattered on both sides of the lake, which are used to do some physical activities.  \n\nBy the way, all kinds of people, regardless of their age, gender and profession, visit this place, in order to escape from the daily boring life. However, even though this place visited mostly by the mature and senior citizens during the early part of the day, the relatively younger people visit it during the later part of the day in the evening.\n\nAnyway, I think that it is an interesting place because so many different kinds of people visit it for different purposes, and yet, they all seem to respect the quietness and serenity of the place. Besides, I think, it is an interesting place also because it has something for everybody, whether he or she wants to hum to some popular music tune or enjoy the tweets of the birds."

    "Answer": "The rail station in my hometown is an interesting place that I know about. There are several other interesting places I know about, but this rail station is the place I've known for a long and in my childhood, this seemed to be a mysterious place to me. The station is a large one and if anyone observes closely, he will find lots of interesting and thought-provoking things there. This busy and noisy station is completely different from the rest of the parts of the town. It is a usually calm town and has harmony in everything. On the other hand, this busy station is a gathering of lots of known and mostly unknown people and this place gives a different impression than the rest of the city. The place is covered with a very large and high rooftop and several overpasses and roads, rail lines, hawkers, beggars, workers and a large lorry have made the place a cryptic place. All of a sudden one day one will find that the large train bogies are gone and the place has been deserted.\n\nTo me, it is an interesting place because I have always found new people and new things there. New hawkers and labours come there and stay for a while, people come to receive their guests or relatives, policemen are there to find frauds and people who might visit without tickets. It is very usual that sometimes people lose their important belongings and then search like madmen. The people who come to say goodbye their friends, relatives bear a sad mark in their faces. The happiness and sadness can be observed from their eyes, faces, and way of talking and from the way they walk to home. This place is always full of noise and the Sharpe whistle and siren of the train is louder than any other sounds there. You will find it empty only if there is a strike on the train.  \n\nInterestingly this small place is a hub of so many different people from different classes. Some come here to earn their livings, some to leave the town and some accompany their relatives. The station employees, hawkers, labours, beggars find it as their workplace.\n\nThe signpost with green and red light, endless rail-line, different people, gathering, liveliness and sadness and many other things and reasons make this place a really interesting place."

    "Answer": "Music is good for our soul. So, like everybody else, I also like to listen to different kinds of music, depending on my mood and situation. However, today, I would like to talk about a piece of music which I wish that I could listen to always.\n\nThe title of this music is called “Confide in me” which is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue and taken from her fifth, self-titled studio album (1994). It was released as the album's lead single on 29 August 1994.  \n\nIncorporating elements of indie music, trip-hop, and Middle Eastern instrumentation, such as strings and percussion, this top-class pop song has experienced success in regions like Australia, United Kingdom, Scotland, Ireland, France, and New Zealand. It also became Minogue's only charting single in the US during the ’90s, having peaked at 39 on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.\n\nHaving listened to this song in the year 2001 for the first time, I felt like, I finally found a piece of music that I could listen to for the rest of my life. In fact, since that year, I can’t really remember a week, which passed by without listening to it or enjoying it at least a few times. Of course, there are a number of reasons for which, I like this music. To begin with, that it is considered as one of the most iconic and innovative singles from the 1990s era as it successfully combined the appeal of “trip-hop” (a new musical genre from the 1990s) with middle eastern musical instruments like strings and percussion.\n\nAnyway, I think it is a great piece of music, mainly because, no matter how many times I listen to it, it never seems to get old.  This music has a very sweet and soft melody.  Besides, its lyrics seem to perfectly match the general appeal (related to the power of seduction) of this music. Finally, this is a great piece of music also because it refreshes the mind and mood of its audience, no matter what time of the day they listen to it."

    "Answer": "I try not to get angry even if I have a very valid reason for it because I feel that getting angry doesn’t exactly solve our problems. But, I am only a human, and I also get mad and angry sometimes just like I did about a couple of years ago. Here is how the story goes:-\n\nA couple of years ago, my younger sister had just finished building her new home, so she naturally wanted everything to be new in her newly-built home. Anyway, after buying pretty much all the items for her house, it was time for us to buy a nice looking and modern oven for her kitchen that had all kinds of features and options. But, unfortunately, we couldn’t find anything like her preference at the stores of our hometown. So, we decided to visit some other stores in a different city. Luckily, we got exactly what we were looking for from one of the stores there, so we told them to get one from their warehouse and pack it for us. But, after opening the oven box at home, we found out that the oven was little bigger in size than what we had ordered for, as it wouldn’t fit properly in the kitchen cabinet of my sister’s kitchen. Apparently, they made a mistake. So, I immediately called them about the mistake, but instead of trying to find a remedy for the situation, the manager told me that it was us who gave them the wrong size. Needless to say, the response from the manager made me really angry. Then I realized that if we didn’t get a proper size oven, we could simply get a larger and separate cabinet to fit it in.\n\nAnyway, after feeling angry and exchanging harsh words with the manager, I felt that I shouldn’t have behaved like that because we didn’t care to check the size of our product ourselves either, after all, before bringing to home. I also called the manager back little later and politely requested him to check the order of their customers with a bit more care."

    "Answer": "I do not usually get angry for small reasons and not one of the short-tempered persons who get angry easily for silly reasons. Yet I got very angry with my friends and I was so furious that I did not talk to them for some days. \n\nThis occurred when I was in 7th semester at my university probably in the year 2010. I had a friend named Rummel who invited me and Stephen to visit his hometown after the term final. Three of us made our plan final and fixed the date for our journey. Since we were not in the same university, we stayed at different places in the city. 3 days before the scheduled date of our journey I called both of them from a local phone booth to be confirmed if the plan is still valid or not. They both told me they are looking forward to the visit and Rummel told me that he has already told his parents and relatives about our visit. \n \nI called my home that I will visit my friend’s hometown and that’s why my visit to them would be a bit delayed. They wished me a safe and pleasant journey.  I got my bags packed the night before our journey and as planned we would meet at the city station at 9.00 am. We planned to go there by train as we thought the train journey would be more enjoyable than the bus journey. \n \nIn the morning of the due date, I wake up early and checked if I have packed all the right stuff or not. Then I picked a taxi and went to the station at 7.30 am. I looked for my friends and found they are yet to come. Rummel was supposed to buy the train tickets and I could not find anyone of them. I looked for them in every place of the station and to my dismay, they were nowhere to be found. In the meantime, I hear that the clock is ticking to announce that it is 10:00 am and I found 2/3 trains already departed. Initially, I was annoyed and when it was 11.30 am I got seriously frustrated and angry. I felt like a stupid and all of my anger started to grow up. I was so angry that I did not call my friends. I sat at the station for another 30 minutes to pacify my anger and then took a taxi to return home. \n \nThey tried to call me to explain the reason they could not show up that morning and almost after 2 weeks they came to my room and explained that due to Stephen’s mother’s sudden and unexpected illness, he had to leave for his hometown that morning. They both thought that the other one has informed me about the cancellation of our tour. I told them that we are even now and I have no complaints about what happened that day."

But, it is also equally important that we find some interesting jobs for ourselves if we really want to feel happy and satisfied. Today, I would like to talk about one such \"interesting and fascinating\" job that I have heard about.\n\nThe job, I am talking about, is “International Travel Consultancy”. I heard about this job from a friend of mine who has been working as a Sr. Operation Manager at a domestic airline of my country. By the way, my friend knew very well that I had such a huge interest in travel-related jobs.\n\nAnyway, as the name “international travel consultant” suggests, this job involves travelling to different exotic and interesting places of the world, including the ocean, mountain sites, architectural marvels and historical places, and learn about them in order to inform the international travellers. The job also involves learning about the cultural aspects, lifestyles, and religions, which are sensitive in nature, of a country or place and presenting them to the international tourists in such a manner that they feel really interested in visiting it. Anyway, one can get this job by working in the travel and hospitality industry, such as a renowned international travel agency or top-rated hotel chain, for a considerable period of time. It would also help a person to get this job if he or he also has a degree or diploma in the travel and tourism field or hospitality field.\n\nAnyway, I think that it is a fascinating job because, in my opinion, one actually gets paid to visit some of the wonderful and exotic places in the world! Besides, there can be nothing better than meeting different kinds of interesting from all over the world and learning about their cultures and lifestyles while also getting paid a handsome amount of money for doing so!

    "Answer": "One of the fascinating jobs that I heard about is \"Game Testing\".  The game testers test the computer, mobile and gaming console games. The game development companies need the games tested before they actually release the games. The game testers' job responsibility is to play the game and find any inconsistency there might have.\n\nTesting is an important part of any software and game release and lots of errors, inconsistency and bugs are fixed during the testing phase and that's why every game development company has its own testing team. I read about this career a few years ago in a computer magazine and later I saw a documentary on game testing in the \"Discovery\" channel. I was fascinated about the job mostly because it is interesting, challenging, creative, a bit different than the traditional 9 to 5 jobs, and offers lots of fun stuff and recreations. Later I searched in Google to learn more about this job and found some enchanting facts and information about it.\n\nSome of these fascinating facts are that game testers are highly qualified and computer graduates who have extensive knowledge of computer programming, graphics, animation, design and testing. Besides, they enjoy flexible office timing and they are allowed to wear any types of dresses they like. The salary they get is higher than the salary of professionals in many other sectors. Moreover, to be a successful game tester someone needs good knowledge in computer technology, the keen eyesight and sharp brain. The work environment is different and they enjoy lots of flexibilities. And finally, as the game industries are doing well and the market is expanding, the future prospect for this job is promising.\n\nThe game testing does not involve playing the games and get paid; rather it is a more challenging profession that requires particular skills and talents. And for all these reasons this job seems quite fascinating and interesting to me."

    "Answer": "Back in the days, when I was a young college and university student, I used to practice and enjoy all kinds of outdoor activities. But, gone are those good old days, and instead, I remain stuck at my job most of the times these days. Such a pity! However, still, there is one favourite activity which I manage to enjoy from time to time which is “photography”.\n\nYes, taking pictures of things and nature around me is one of my most favourite outdoor activities these days. Not sure, how exactly I became interested in this particular activity, but I am assuming that it probably has something to do with my “not-so” good looking picture face. In fact, I disliked some of my pictures so much that I even used to keep them hidden from the people around while also wondering at the same time as to why pictures were not as good looking as other people. So, I came up with the idea of getting my own camera as soon as I started my university, and started experimenting with taking pictures of the things and nature around me.\n\nSoon after that, I figured out that many factors come into play when taking a good picture – factors like the distance, light, quality of lens and composition, among other things. Now, I can easily turn some ordinary objects into some likeable pictures. Of course, even though, I take pictures of all kinds of things, it’s the nature which interests me the most. In fact, I would wait even hours just to take a good shot of a beautiful flower plant or a flying bird above my head.\n\nAnyway, photography is my favourite outdoor activity, mainly because it allows me to understand the things and nature around me a lot better. Besides, it also allows me to spend and enjoy my time according to my own terms without necessarily depending on others. Finally, I enjoy photography also because it allows me to capture some great moments of some objects around me and then look at them at a later time to see how fast things change around us."

    "Answer": "My favourite outdoor activity is visiting parks, fields, playgrounds and open spaces with my close friends. I do it in one of the nearby parks, large playgrounds, botanical gardens, besides a lake or river and in any similar natural open spaces. Sometimes I invite friends to come to such a place which is nearby my home or sometimes we do it in the different parts of the city we live in.  \n\nI often take my bicycle and use it as my transportation to reach those places. I cannot do it daily but I gather with my friends usually once or twice in a week. We go to the park or near a river, enjoy our time, gossip on different topics, talk about movies and books, enjoy our friends’ companion and so some sort of physical exercises like walking, swimming, running or cycling.\n\nI really like to spend time with my friends as they are very close to me and they are very good friends of mine. I like their companionship as we have lots of common interests. We learn things from each other and value our friendship. Moreover, we stay inside the room; be it a house, university, office or other places, and this activity lets us spend time close to nature and in a healthy and open environment. The open spaces give fresh air, eradicates our boredom and fatigue, and it is really refreshing to do some sort of outdoor activities in the evening. For all these reasons, I like this outdoor activity more than any other outdoor activity I have."

    "Answer": "I must say that I have been lucky to have a number of great friends around me. While I met some of them just recently or a few years ago, some others have remained friends to me for a long, long period of time. In fact, some of them have remained my friends from my early high school days, and today here I would like to describe one of those friends.\n\nHis name is Nayeem Seikh. He used to attend the same grade as me in the same high school, we attended, more than 15 years ago. If I remember correctly, I talked to Nayeem for the first time when I requested him to look after my backpack (use it to carry my books) for a while, as I wanted to leave the school premise for a while to grab some snacks for myself. He gladly agreed, and it was from that time that our long friendship started.\n\nAnyway, I have known Nayeem as one of those most gentle and humble guys I have ever met. He is more on the quiet side, and that probably what makes him such an intelligent person. And, it is because of his intelligent type, I have sought advice from him in the past on numerous occasions.  In fact, I seek advice from him, over the phone or through letters, still today even though he lives in another city which is almost 300 kilometres away from my city. Of course, it’s not like I contact him only when I need his advice, but rather, I call him or email him every once in a while just to say “hello”.\n\nAnyway, my friendship with Nayeem is important to me because we have a lot of history and good memories together. Besides, I am blessed that there is hardly any friend around me, who understands me as good as my good friend Nayeem, which means that I can talk to him freely about any stuff. Finally, this friendship is important to me also because I can always rely on him for any kind of advice or consultation."

    "Answer": "I have many friends and among them, there are a few friends whom I have known for a long time. One such friend is (...say the name of your friend...) and he has many distinctive characteristics. I know him from my childhood and I value our friendship so much.\n\nHe comes from a middle-class family and he has a natural talent of learning everything very quickly. I met him for the first time in my school when he sat near me. He had some distinctive characteristics and that's why I started observing closely and later we became friends. Though he was very talented, he did not have the tendency to hold on to something for a long. He was the most talented boy in our class but because of some whimsical decisions and because of his priority to his own wishes, he does not have a bright and prosperous career. He was a very good chess player, an excellent all-rounder in cricket, a good defender in football, a tactical badminton player and the quickest math solver in our class. Everybody thought he would become either a math professor or an engineer and sometimes people thought that he would become a good athlete, but he finally did his graduation in History as he thought that this would allow him to learn a lot. After he finished his graduation he learned some programming and designing and started his career in Information Technology. He worked for 3 years in this sector and then all of a sudden, decided to leave this day job and work as a freelancer. As far as I know, he's been a good programmer and designer and in his freelancing career, he is doing well.\n\nHe often travels to different places and leads a life bit away from society. He has not married yet and I guess he has no intention to do so. He is talented and sometimes whimsical.\n\nHe is a close friend of mine and though we do not spend much time together, we have a strong bond and we value our friendship. I know how much talented and creative he is. I like his morality, talent, truthfulness, boldness, bravery and his unquenchable thrust for knowledge and freedom."

    "Answer": "James is more than a friend to me. He is, in fact, my best friend and I like to spend my time with him more than any other friend. He is one year senior to me and I met him in my grade 4. On the first day of our class in grade 4, he sat beside me and when I observed him being busy with something that was hidden in his desk, I became curious about him. Next week I lent him one of my storybooks and thus we knew each other. We are still friends and apart from some very minor incidents, we have always been in a good relationship as friends.\n\nHe is working in a consultancy firm these days and planning to settle in Canada with his family. On the other hand, I am planning to complete my Master's degree in a reputed UK university. We still try to meet each other in our free time and have conversations about different issues and topics. Our discussion includes our family, politics, books, works, films, music, our friends and our plans for the future.  \n\nI believe that James is a bit different from others. While many other friends got busy with their work and hardly communicated me, James on the contrary always kept in touch. He even wrote to me regularly when he was in a different city. Thus our friendship became stronger with our regular interaction, mutual trust on each other and due to our many common interests. We respect each other, criticise each other if needed and always try to help each other. Respect and trust, in my opinion, are two very strong elements for a strong friendship and we never had any issue regarding these two. I consider him as my best friend because I never have to pretend anything in front of him, I can be quite myself with him and we can comfortably continue any conversation no matter how different our views are on this.  \n\nWe were in the same class in school from grade 4 till grade 10. Then I got admitted to a different school. However, the 6 years when we were together in school were some of the best years of our life. We were younger at that time and everything was different then. There were numerous occasions when we did exciting and interesting things that our parents would not have allowed us to do. For instance, collecting frogs of various species in a large box, visiting old buildings to find hidden treasures, fighting with other boys, visiting theatre without informing anyone and swimming in the river without anyone's knowledge were some activities we enjoyed together and knew none of our parents would have permitted us to do.  \n\nIn our life, we make different types of relationships and friendship is one such important relationship that lasts forever. Good friends are like brothers and sisters who will comfort you, guide you, criticise you if needed, accompany you, encourage you, and help you in your rainy days. James is such a friend who has done those all for me and is still a person I can rely on. He is more like a family member to me than an outsider. Without any doubt, he is my best friend."

    "Answer": "We meet so many people in our life of all ages, backgrounds and professions at some points of our life because we all are somehow dependant on each other. Of course, we don’t feel the same way about all of them, when it comes to socializing with them or meeting them unless, of course, they are some special people who we met during our childhood. Today, I would like to talk about meeting one such person, whom I met a long time ago when I still was a high school student.\n\nThe person, I am talking about, is none other than my favourite science teacher. His name was Chun Lee, but we all loved to call him Mr Lee, and he was one of the best teachers I have ever met.\n\nOf course, there were a few other science teachers at our high school, but they actually made me more confused about science subject than actually making them easier. Of course, I don’t think that it was actually their faults that they made me confused about the science subjects, but rather it was me who wasn’t just good enough to understand the subjects. In fact, because of those teachers, I even wanted to give up the idea of becoming an engineer someday.\n\nAnyway, talking about Mr Lee again, he was more of a great motivator to me rather than a teacher, simply because I have seldom seen anybody managing to bring so much positive energy in a person by talking about the good things in life. In fact, I would never forget about some of his wise words which said that every problem in this world has a solution and every person has an “Einstein” in him.\n\nAnyway, I want to meet this childhood teacher now because I want him to see how one of his very average students has become a successful CEO of one of the most prestigious accounting firms of his country because of his motivational words. I want to thank him now because he actually believed in me when everybody else just gave up on my future."

    "Answer": "I was lucky to have so many talented teachers in my childhood and some of them are still alive. I remember some of them very well and would like to meet some of them if there are chances. One particular teacher whom I wanted to meet and still would like to meet is Mr Drabir who was the math teacher in our grade 4. \n\nHe was a tall man, well over 6 feet and was heavily built. He was much like an athlete than a teacher. He used to take our math class and he had a great way of teaching. With his big body, he possessed all the kindles and humanity a person can have. He was so a gentleman that he treated his student very kindly which was very rare among other teachers. He always started telling us stories before going through the intricacies of the math. He had a great way of teaching and because of his teaching style, I became very interested in math. I heard that he has retired from the teaching profession and now living in his hometown with his family. \n\nThe teacher was very kind and helpful to me. He showed a very affectionate behaviour to me. I was kind of amused with his way of teaching and personality. He has always helped me understanding math if I had confusions and thus an intimate relationship grew between us. I treated him as a great mentor and he treated me as an enthusiast student. The teacher was very helpful in every way possible for the students. The greatest thing he did was the way he taught us. He often helped the poor students so that they can continue their studies. He gave us many important lessons and inspired us to spend more time doing mathematics. \n\nThus he was an excellent person and an amazing teacher. For all those reasons, I have a very positive image of this teacher and would like to meet him someday. There is a good possibility that he won’t even remember me and yet meeting him would be a great experience for me."

    "Answer": "I love all kinds of food items when I am hungry whether I am eating them at home or at a restaurant. But, I come from a family which always prefer eating at home than to eating outside, no matter how good some of the food at restaurants taste. However, my mother doesn’t mind if I eat one particular food item outside of my home since it is called the world-famous “German Chocolate Cake”.\n\nYes, German chocolate cake is undoubtedly one of my most favourite desserts, if not the most favourite, of all time. Interestingly enough, I don’t like to eat other chocolate cakes, but if it ever comes to eating a very good German chocolate cake, I won’t mind it even if I have to travel miles to eat it. And when I eat it, I never really stop at eating just one piece, but rather I keep eating them until I don’t crave for it anymore.\n\nBy the way, I have always asked myself how possibly a person, who doesn’t like chocolate cakes, can enjoy eating a thing called “German chocolate cake”. So, why I like it so much? Well, to appreciate and understand my answer to this question, you actually have to feel the “out of this world” sweet crunch of the Coconut Pecan icing, combined with the not too sweet and not too bitter taste of the German's chocolate, along with the taste of rich creamy buttermilk. Now, where can we get such a perfect combination of sweet, sour, and bitter in a cake mix in order to make one of the most amazing tastes ever made other than in a chocolate cake!\n\nAnyway, I like this particular food item, primarily because the truth is, neither I nor any of my family member is able to bake such a tasty cake at home. Besides, when I go to eat this cake outside, I also get to taste some other delicious food items that help me change my taste from time to time after eating the same kinds of food at home for a long time."

    "Answer": "I like to eat pizza outside the home. Pizza is not made in our house except on a very rare occasion once or twice in a year and that's why I have always eaten it outside my home. Dominos Pizza, Pizza Inn, Helvetia, Tongue & Tommy, Pizzasta are some of my favourite places where I eat pizza.\n\nI like it because it is tasty and delicious. This food item requires only a few minutes to be served and I can eat it when I am in a hurry. Another reason is the variation this food item has. Several types of pizza can be found and because of that, a pizza lover can taste the different types of pizza and variation of those pizzas. It is cheaper compared to other dishes I eat outside. A moderate size pizza can be shared among 3-4 persons. Finally, it is not a very rich food and can be eaten at any time of the day.\n\nI usually eat pizza once in a week and the frequency of eating pizza sometimes depends on the frequency of my meeting my friends in a restaurant who serves pizza. Eating pizza is not occasion dependent like some other dishes like Mexican foods, Italian food etc. I mostly eat pizza when I need a quick meal and when I meet my friends in a restaurant. Since pizza is liked by most of my friends, when we sit together in a place where pizza is served and we need to eat something, we mostly order pizza."

    "Answer": "Taking trips to all kinds of places is a part of our daily life, whether we travel in our private vehicles or use some kind of public transportation. Of course, as far as I am concerned, I am more comfortable to take my trips on my motorbike when I am travelling short distances. But, when I travel long distances, I usually use public transportation, and today I would like to talk about one such long-distance trips which I took about a few weeks ago.\n\nAnyway, I took the trip to attend a wedding ceremony of one of my cousins who lives about a couple of kilometres away from me in another city. Since it was a long trip, I naturally wanted to use public transportation except, of course, I just couldn’t decide on whether to use a public bus or public train. Buses travel usually faster than train in my country but they don’t usually provide an opportunity to freshen up or eat any kind of food or snacks during the journey. But, on the other hands, even though, trains run a bit slow, they all offer the opportunity for refreshment. In fact, all of the public trains in my country have canteens to offer food for the travellers, and of course, they also have washrooms to freshen up.\n\nSo, after considering the pros and cons of using both types of public transportation, I finally decided to make my trip on a public train. Of course, it took me a little longer to arrive at my destination with train, but the trip was comfortable, and relaxing, especially, because of playing some \"classical and hit songs\" throughout the entire journey.\n\nAnyway, I chose to use public transportation, primarily because it provided more safety and security in my travel. In fact, I didn’t have to worry about getting involved in any kind of unfortunate event or accident. Besides, I found travelling by train more comfortable and relaxing because it provided a much larger space to manoeuvre around when I needed to stretch a little. Finally, I never felt any travel fatigue after arriving at my destination."

    "Answer": "Though I own a car, I often use public transportation. I do so to allow other family members to use my car for their own important tasks and sometimes I use public transportation, like the bus, to travel a long distance, especially to a different city. Some of the remote areas are not quite as easy to travel by cars and for those places, I use public transportation like the rickshaw, taxi or the rented motorbike. One such trip that I remember I took 2 years ago when I visited one of my aunts' house. My aunt was married to a civil engineer and they had 3 kids. Their living place was kind of a remote area and took almost 10-12 hours to reach. It was the mid-autumn when I had the trip and I alone went there. I had to use 3-4 different public transportation to finally reach my aunt's house.\n\nI took a bus and it stopped when we reached near a river after 4-5 hours journey. I had to use a boat to pass the river and after that, I took another bus and finally an auto-rickshaw to reach my aunt’s living place.\n\nThe trip was a long one and it was neither a very pleasant journey nor a very disturbing one as well. Changing the transportation a few times, carrying two such heavy bags was something that annoyed me. But I enjoyed the natural scenery, a different routine than the usual busy life, scenic beauty on both sides of the road, the beautiful river and the new people and place. I mostly listened to music from my MP3 player and read a magazine on my journey and I enjoyed that also.\n\nI took public transportation mainly for 3 reasons. Firstly, I left it home so that other family members can use it if needed as I would be away for about a week. Secondly, I did not know the exact route to the place I travelled and that's why it would have been a bit uncertain to take my private car to a route that I have no idea about. Finally, it was a remote area and taking my car would have caused extra tension like parking it, fueling it and that why I preferred to take the journey in public transportation."

    "Answer": "If I remember it correctly, I heard many, many stories, which were/are well-known in my country for a long period of time, from my grandparents and the other elderly people around me.  Needless to say, I liked all those stories because virtually all of them had the elements of surprise, drama and suspense one way or another. Here is just one such story which was shared with me by my maternal grandmother, when I was a little child.\n\nThe story is entitled as “Mansamangal” (the virtue of Mansa, a Hindu Goddess) which was written to attribute glory and honour to Manasa, a Hindu goddess of snakes. However, it has become renowned for the love story between Behula (the wife) and Lakhindar (her husband).\n\nThe epic story goes on to tell how the father of Lakhindar upsets the goddess Manasa by refusing to worship her. She then becomes very angry and bites Lakhindar on his wedding night in order to exact her revenge. Because of the deadly bite, Lakhindar dies, but Behula (the wife) just refuses to give up on her husband and takes his lifeless body on a boat and sails off. After appeasing the goddess of snakes and asking for forgiveness from her, Lakhindar is eventually brought back to life again. Behula is often said to represent the essence of Bengali women from the Indian subcontinent, who never fail to demonstrate their extreme courage and love for their husbands.  \n\nBy the way, I remember the story because every time, I used to behave like an unruly boy or didn’t want to go to bed, my grandmother used to remind me about the bad snakes to force me to go to bed.\n\nAnyway, this story is well-known in my country, mainly because it carries some religious connotation. It is also well-known because a very significant number of people in our part of the world still believe in all sorts of superstitions. Finally, this has remained a very well-known story in my country because such stories tell us a lot about inhabitants of the past such as their principles, customs and reasoning on matters."

    "Answer": "Some of the Aesop's Fables are very well-known in our country and many people tell these stories without even knowing the origin of those stories. Some of the stories have been a little bit modified with the context and people of our country and some of them remain intact. We have even read some of Aesop’ stories in our textbook and almost all of the citizens of our country know those stories. \n\nOne such well-known story from Aesop is the story of ‘The Hare & the Tortoise’ that people often tell others as a piece of advice and to the child to entertain and advise them. I heard this story from my grandfather for the first time and it was almost 20 years ago. Later on, I read this story in my textbook in grade 4. \n\nThat was an interesting story that has a good moral and lesson. The storytelling of my grandfather was amazing and he made this story much more appealing and as I have read it in my textbook, I still remember this story. The story starts with a hare and a tortoise. The hare often made fun of the tortoise for being very slow and mocked him all the time. The hare mocked the tortoise if he ever reaches to any place at all with this unbelievably slow speed. A competition was arranged they both started their race when all other animals of the jungle were present to witness this. The hare started to run and soon was out of sight while the tortoise started walking very slowly. After a while, the hare felt it ridiculous to run with a tortoise and decided to take a nap until the tortoise could be seen nearby. The tortoise meanwhile kept going with a slow by the steady pace and after a while passed the place where the hare was in deep sleep. The hare slept peacefully and when he woke up, the tortoise had almost reached the finish line. The hare then ran very swiftly with his best effort but could not overtake the tortoise in time. Thus the tortoise won the race with his steadiness and determination even after being slow. \n\nThe story was a great example of teaching children the importance of steadiness and determination and thus has become a very popular story in our country. We often use this story to teach others that do not boast on your ability, the race is not always to the swift, do not make fun of others even if you are superior to him, so not underestimate the ability of others, be persistent on something you do and do not waste time idly when you have a task to finish. Thus this story has become a popular story that bears many morals and lessons."

The city, in which I live, is no exception, as it also is going through some visible changes.\n\nThese changes are visible more or less in all parts of the cities, but it is certainly more visible at the centre part of the city because this is where most of the financial and commercial activities take place. But the problem is, this centre part of the city has become so congested because of too many building, businesses and stores that getting through to it becomes very much like wrestling.\n\nThe traffic situation becomes even worse during office hours. In order to deal with this rather unbearable and unpleasant situation at one of the major cities of my country, the local government has taken up projects to grow vertically instead of horizontally. In other words, some buildings, which are covering large areas, are being demolished in order to replace with high rise buildings. Apparently, this particular action would leave more empty space in the area for the city dwellers to move more freely and easily. Another change, that is being visible at the city centre, is that new but wider roads are being paved with concrete to provide easy access to the people who visit it to meet their daily needs. Needless to say, more and more new businesses and shops with popular brand names are making their grand entrance into this place to meet the increasing demands of its residents.\n\nAnyway, I feel really good about these changes and activities because it will apparently give a new and better look to our city. Besides, all these changes and activities will create more employment opportunities for the residents of my city where the unemployment rate is comparatively higher than the rest of the country. Finally, I like these changes, because it will benefit us and the consumers in large, as there would be more healthy competitions among the businesses."

    "Answer": "I have been living in (..say your city name...) for the last 15 years and know almost every street of this city. The city I knew the first time I came here is far more different than the city has evolved now. The north part of the city has changed more than any part of the city and still changing.\n\nWhen I first visited this part of the city, it was mostly an open space that had lots of fields, trees and a very minimum number of dwellers. There were hardly any high rising building and mostly farmers and fishers lived there. The fields, lakes and people’s way of living used to give an impression of urban life. But this is no longer applicable for this part of the city. I went to that part of the city a few days back after a long time and was very surprised to notice the changes which occurred there and still happening.\n\nThe need for industrialisation, to accommodate the increasing population and for the business expansion, the part has changed dramatically. The open spaces, fields, and lakes have reduced significantly and one can notice the overwhelming number of factories, industries and offices there. This place no longer gives the urban area impression rather it gives a neo-industrial area impression. The numbers of roads and cars have increased, the farmers and fishers have moved to the farther north side of the city and 2 new colleges and universities have been built there.\n\nI feel the necessity of the new industries and offices and their importance for a country, but the way this part of the city has been transformed is really shocking. There could have been an alternative place for industries and the city administrators and authorities could have saved the natural part of the city. Already the city is overpopulated and because of that we are facing lots of problems, the changes of this part of the city have caused to accommodate more people and have destroyed the natural habitat of wild lives. I feel sad to notice the changes happening in this part of the city."

    "Answer": "This is such a tough topic for me because, frankly speaking, I was more of a “homely” child who didn’t exactly like to get out of his home except for just going to school. In other words, I didn’t really have many hobbies, which required me to go outside of the home, other than watching cartoons. Then again, watching cartoon itself can also be considered as a hobby. Isn’t it?\n\nNot sure, why exactly I adopted this hobby, but I guess that it must have something to do with the cat that I raised as my pet. So, when I first saw “Tom and Jerry” (the famous Disney land cartoon) and found out that the cat named “Tom” was getting into trouble just like my little pet cat, I became hooked to it. After that, of course, I have seen many, many other cartoons, but I never found them as funny as “Tom and Jerry”.  \n\nBut that didn’t stop me from watching those cartoons during my childhood because they always stimulated my mind and brain to draw some sort of parallel between a real world, in which we live, and the imaginary world, in which the cartoon characters live, only to find out, of course, that the world, in which we live, is not as rosy and nice as they try to portray in cartoons. I adopted this hobby also because my parents didn’t really want me to go out too much, lest I would get influenced by bad company or social elements. So, I guess that I didn’t have any other option except to keep liking watching the cartoons because it at least kept my parents happy while I also kept getting my favourite chips and the toys for my pet cat.    \n\nAnyway, watching cartoon is not my hobby anymore because, for better or worse, I have grown much older to figure out that even though, cartoons can make us laugh, they don’t do anything to solve our real-world problems. Besides, now I have found much better hobbies to try and they are way more interesting than “Tom and Jerry”."

    "Answer": "In different stages of childhood and teenage time, different things attracted me and some of the hobbies I had then are no longer present in me. One such hobby of my childhood was collecting stamps. \n\nI was a student of grade 4 when I first found that interesting hobby. I noticed that one of my classmates has a good collection of stamps and they were catalogued based on countries in his stamp book. The idea of collecting stamp impressed me and I thought to start collecting the stamps as well. \n \nWhen I start collecting stamps I had no particular reason for doing so but the idea of collecting stamps and having a good collection seemed an appealing idea to me. But later I found that it is a good hobby that helped me knowing many different cultures, persons, occasions and custom of my country and foreign countries as well. For instance, after a found a stamp of the USA that had the Statue of Liberty printed on it, I asked my teacher about it and he explained the details information of it. In another occasion, I came to know about Alfred Nobel, Marie Curie, Abraham Lincoln, Vasko da Gama etc. from the stamps I had. The stamps also have many historical events or cultural events printed on them and I learned about them as well. Some of the stamps were from countries that I never knew about and thus the stamp collection habit helped me enhance my knowledge. Apart from that, I found that kids who collect stamps have common interests and thus become close to others. One such friend of mine was David whom I would have never met unless I had this hobby in my childhood. In my childhood, I liked this hobby mostly from pure passion & excitement and the opportunity to know about different events, famous persons and events of history. \n \nI am not exactly sure how I abandoned this hobby later on when I grew up but my best possible guess would be - because of my involvement in other stuff, interest in other things and business in school and study. I remember I had the stamp collecting hobby till I was in grade 8 and later on I got busy in my study, grown interest in computer technology, start playing outdoor games and developed the habit of reading storybooks and novels. \n \nThe stamp book I had in my school has been kept in a safe place by my mother and who knows someday I will give it to my son/ daughter and s/he would start collecting more stamps."

    "Answer": "If we ask ourselves as to how many leaders or politicians in this world have managed to become prime minister of a country at the age of 91 again after serving in the same capacity as a prime minister for about 22 years in the past? Well, the answer is, probably only one.\n\nHis name is Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, the sitting prime minister of Malaysia, who has made it almost a habit to defeat his political opponent at ease. Otherwise, how possibly an old person of his age can make such a strong comeback in politics after remaining politically inactive, apart from criticizing his successor every once in a while, for almost 15 years! What’s the secret behind such an enviable accomplishment?\n\nWell, there could be many reasons, one could possibly guess for that, but one thing, for sure, is certain that he is from a completely different breed of politicians who is able to show his guts and grits in the face of extreme adversity unlike anybody else. In fact, very few leaders in this world have managed to remain calm and lead on to transform a third world country into a role model of economic success for all the countries around the world. Besides, as a politician of simple nature, who always likes to put the interest of his people ahead of everything else, one of the most appealing things about this great political leader is that he is never afraid to voice out his opposition to all kinds of oppression.\n \nAnyway, I admire this person because of his visionary leadership and statesmanship who completely changed the face of Malaysia from a third world country to a regional economic powerhouse within just 22 years. Some people may passionately call him a “benevolent dictator”, but his intention to listen to his people carefully certainly makes a very admirable person, not only among his own people but also to people from the rest of the world. Finally, I admire him also because he never likes to give up in achieving his dream for his nation."

He was a mainstream politician for a long and was involved in active politics from his school life. He had a great contribution to our freedom fighting as well as in several other activities for the betterment of our nation. He lived from 1940 till 2000 and his death was a great loss for the nation. \n\nHe was an honest and brave politician which has become rare in present days. He never compromised with the evil power of politics and foreign powers. He had risked his life several times and with his bravery, he had bought some advantageous changes in the country. He was an idol for the nations and for his honesty and bravery he is a well-known figure in the world. \n\nHe was an active member of the (...say a political party name…) and never longed for power or fame. He could have easily gained a powerful position in the country but he had always led a simple and yet exemplary life. \n\nI admire him for his unmatched contribution to the country and for the nation. We need many leaders like him and I regret the fact that we have only very few leaders like him in our country. He was an ideal leader who has put his personal benefits away while he thought for the benefits of the country and the nation."

Among those impressive leaders and politicians, I would pick (...say a famous leader's name...) as my most favourite leader whom I really admire and respect.\n\nHe is such a popular and beloved leader that I have found that most of the people like and admire him. He possesses a very high political position with really immense power and yet he has chosen to lead such an ordinary and poor life that it is possible only by a dedicated, honest, good-hearted and completely honest leader. While he could have made a great fortune and could have exercised his power like many other politicians and leaders, he has chosen the honesty, integrity, responsibility and truth as his virtues.\n\nThe most appealing part about him is his honesty and fierceness for the truth and just. He does not fear anyone as long as it is to establish the just and right. Because of his invaluable contribution and dedication to many positive changes have been made in our country. I, like many others, like him because of his honesty, truthfulness, and fight for justice, dedication, patriotism, and benevolent attitude to the poor people. He is a rare politician in this era of corruption and selfishness. The world needs more leaders like him to make it a better place.\n\nI am sure with his contribution our nation will progress further. The vision and leadership quality of this politician would inspire the young party members to contribute towards the betterment of the nation."

    "Answer": "These days, the habit of writing a letter with pen and notepad is almost gone, courtesy of the invention of the computer, the internet technology and email, but there was a time when people actually considered letter-writing habit as some form of art by adopting different kinds of writing styles. In fact, I also took this letter-writing habit with pen and paper rather seriously as a high school student before more than 15 years when I didn’t have any access to computer or internet.\n\nToday, I would like to talk about one such letter which I wrote to my grandfather when I just got admitted to one of the prestigious high schools in my country. By the way, if I remember it correctly, by then, I had just started to like the idea of writing a letter to people, I knew. So, quite naturally, I was yet to fully capture the art of organizing my thoughts and express them in a coherent manner.\n\nBut that didn’t prevent me to write a letter to my grandfather to tell him how I liked my new school, and how I was struggling to make new friends at a new school. The letter also included subjects like which teachers were nice to me, and which teachers were tough. I also didn’t forget to mention about the great \"tiffin\", provided by the school, which I really enjoyed eating, as well as the large playing ground where my senior brothers from school used to play football. However, the story of this letter writing thing wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t mention that I had actually wasted almost half of my notepad, which contained about 30 pages, to write that precious letter.\n\nAnyway, writing this letter was important to me, mainly because I was missing my grandfather, who loved me so much, after moving to a place boarding school. Besides, it also offered me an opportunity for the first time to learn how to express my thoughts properly in writing unlike the childish way of writing in the past."

I was admitted to a renowned school when I was 10 years old and had to stay at the school boarding during my study there. I was sad to leave my parents and siblings but had no other choice other than staying at the boarding as the school did not accept stay-home students. After I left my home and start my life in school boarding, I missed my family very much. I would like to describe a letter that I wrote to my mother while my staying at the boarding. \n\nI wrote the letter to my mother and I wrote to let her know that I was fine and not to worry about me. I also wrote how much I was missing them and how things were going on in my school life. I also asked how my father was doing, if he had mentioned me, what my brother and sister are doing these days and if they are missing me. I remember asking a lot of questions in my letter and told all the positive things about my new life so that my mother does not worry too much. \n \nI wrote about my teachers, new classmates and how welcoming they are. I mentioned that I like the foods they are serving and I am doing my study attentively. That was a letter written by a little boy (..mention girl if you are a girl…) to his (…her..) mother to let her know that he (..she…) was fine and asked if they were missing him (…her..) or not. \nTo me, this was an important letter as this was the first time I wrote to my mother. I wrote to let her know that I love them very much and was missing them. I was a bit lonely at that time and the letter was a form of conversation and to keep in touch with my dearest mother and other family members."

    "Answer": "Everything in the city, in which I live, is supposed to be familiar to me because I have been living in this city for a long period of time. But, apparently, this doesn’t seem to be so because I am finding the job of describing a street, which I am supposed to know well, a bit more challenging than I had initially thought for some unknown reasons. So, was I wrong all along about knowing my city?\n\nAnyway, the city, I am going to try to describe, is one of the major streets in the large neighbourhood, where I live. It runs east-west and stretches about one and a half kilometres. If I have got proper information about this street, it was one of the oldest streets in the city as well. In fact, it was made in the very early days of the city’s expansion, and perhaps, that’s why most buildings, which are standing on both sides of this street, look old. Of course, there are also few shops here and there in between the buildings as well as an elementary school for the kids, but the sheer number of the buildings on this street suggest that many families and people live in that part of the neighbourhood.  \n\nLuckily, this is a rather wide street, and therefore, even though, it remains fairly busy with all sorts of private and public vehicles, it doesn’t seem to be as congested as a number of other streets in my city. Paved with high-quality concrete, this street connects a couple of major roads which are used to make an exit from our city premise.\n\nAnyway, I visit the street and the place at least once a week, because I use it to go to my uncle’s house, who lives on the other side of my city. Besides, I know this place really well because I attended the elementary school there for a couple of years. In fact, I know this place so well that I still remember how most of the old trees there were cut to make room for building new houses a long time ago."

This street is called grace street (...say the name of a street you know about...) and it is at the back side of the high school we used to study at.\n\nThis is not a very wide street and since it is on the back side, people often avoid this road and take the main street. There are some 2-3 storied buildings there and one 7th storied building is situated beside this street. A large portion of the street-side is occupied by the high school and there is a pond, 2 lamp posts, one post office and 2 small tea stalls are situated beside this street.\n\nI used to visit this street and spent time with my friends in my teenage time mostly. Since I now live in a different city I rarely visit this street. However, I go to this street sometimes with my friends whenever I visit my hometown. This is the place where I spend my time with my friends in the evening when I stay in my hometown. I go to my hometown 3-4 times in a year and visit this street each time I visit my hometown.\n\nI like this street because I have so many memories related to this street. I still go there whenever I visit my town. And this very street where I used to spend some of my golden periods reminds me of my old time there. Being there with my friends sometimes reminds me of things I used to do there and how precious the time was. For these reasons, I like this street very much."

After all, our family members are and should always be the most important persons in our lives. Needless to say, I also recognize the importance of this close bond among the family members, and hence the recent visit, which I am about to talk.\n\nAnyway, the person, I visited, was one of my older cousins at his house about a few months ago because he suffered some major injuries in an accident. By the way, I and my older cousin have a very special relationship because it was him who taught me a lot of things, like flying kite, fishing in a lake and riding a bicycle, among many other things. In fact, he has always treated me like his own younger brother, he never had. So, when I learned about his injuries, I immediately decided to visit him except, of course, I had a lot of pending tasks at my job, and my boss just didn’t want me to leave the office unless I had taken care of those tasks.\n\nSo, I had to wait a couple of days before I could get out of my town and travel about 8 hours in order to see my injured cousin. As soon as he saw me in his room, he wanted to get up from his bed and give me a hug. But, I asked him not to rush because I was there to spend the next day. By the way, my visit made my cousin so happy that he spent the rest of the evening by talking about the memories from our old days.\n\nWell, the visit was particularly important to me because my cousin had always treated me in a very special way in the past, and I wanted to show to him that I would always be on his side. Besides, the visit was also important to me because I hadn’t seen him in a long time."

I often visit my hometown and a few times I visited my sisters' houses as well. I would like to talk about the visit I had to my eldest sister's house a few months back. It was not a pre-planned visit. I went to my sister's house as soon as I heard that my little niece got sick and my brother-in-law was out of the country at that time.  \n\nAfter I heard the news of my niece's sickness, I packed my stuff and left for my hometown. There I met my parents and stayed for about 2 hours or so. My journey to my hometown took around 4 hours. Then I took some home-made foods and other stuff for my sister and my niece which my mother gave me and then left for my sister's house. The journey took another 3 hours and I took a public bus, a taxi and finally a CNG four-wheeler.\n\nI had to be there to help my sister and take care of my 8 years old niece who got ill. No other male family member was present at the house that time and I was a great help for my sister. As my niece was very sick, my sister needed someone to mentally support her and help her with some works as well. I called the doctor, purchased fruits and medicines and took my niece to the diagnostic centre for test and reports as well. For all those reasons I had to go there and my presence, there was utmost important."

But, today, I don’t think like that anymore after seeing how a car can help us in order to make our life easy. In fact, I am even planning to buy a car in future.\n\nAnyway, the car, I wish to buy in the future, which is “Honda Pilot”. This is a luxurious sport utility vehicle, or SUV, with an optional but easily accessible third-row seat, which can accommodate up to 8 people. It is a standard 280 horsepower 3.5-liter i-VTEC V-6 engine and also has Multi-angle rearview camera with guidelines. I would prefer my car to be a dark blue colour, with leather seats and champagne colour interior, as well as to have a GPS navigation system. One of the features of this SUV, that really attracts me, is its optional “Panoramic Roof”, which allows all passengers to enjoy views of the sky even when they are sitting at the very back of the car. I also like the fact that Rear-seat passengers in this car can watch the miles fly while enjoying its high-definition entertainment via the available Blue-ray Rear Entertainment System. I really like this SUV because it runs so smoothly without making any noise at all.\n\nAnyway, I want to buy this great looking SUV for the purpose of taking me and my whole family to a different place at ease without having to worry about waiting for public transportation. I would also like to buy the vehicle because it would help me to go to my job easily and quickly. Besides, I want to buy it also because it would help me save a lot of money when travelling a long distance, especially, when travelling together with 7/8 persons. After all, it would cost a lot more money to buy the train, bus or flight tickets for 7/8 persons. Finally, I want to buy this car because it would elevate my image as a person and it has all the necessary safety and comfort features for a long trip."

    "Answer": "I do not own a car and have been planning to purchase a personal car for the last 1 year. I have planned to purchase a car that would facilities me and my family members to go to different places as an alternative to public transportation.\n\nCurrently, we use public transportations and because of that, we can’t plan our schedule in a flexible way. We have to heavily depend on the schedules of the public transportations and that kills lots of time. Waiting in a long queue for the bus is very inconvenient and we often feel the need for a personal car. I guess owning a personal car would give us lots of flexibilities and we would be able to go together more frequently in our free time. We often cancel attending programs arranged by relatives and friends because of the heavy traffic jam on the road. A personal car would allow us to avoid busy roads and attend more social programs.\n\nI often get late for important meeting and schedules because of my dependency on the public car. Furthermore, in a personal car, I would be able to spend time the way I like and that would be relaxing while being in a public car is sometimes very exhausting.\n\nSometimes the shopping I do becomes cumbersome to carry on in public transportation and my car would allow me to easily carry them home. We have 2-3 kids in our home and we feel unsafe to take them with us in public transportation. A personal car would ensure the safety for the kids as well on the street."

Of course, people would choose to define expensive differently, but I am not really debating here as to what really should be considered as expensive and what shouldn’t be. Instead, I am here to talk about an expensive item that I have purchased recently.\n\nIt is a branded perfume, and I bought it (more like “forced” to buy it) about a couple of months ago when I was visiting a new perfume store with one of my friends in my hometown. By the way, I do like to use different kinds of perfumes because the same scent or fragrance, if used for a long period of time, loses its appeal to me. So, I try to buy affordable perfumes at a more regular interval instead of spending a fortune in buying some expensive perfumes.\n\nAnyway, after visiting the new perfume store, I found that it was selling a lot of perfumes at a discounted price, apparently, in an effort to make the store popular to customers. However, I noticed that even though the perfumes were selling at a discounted rate, I felt that they were still expensive. But, my friend thought otherwise and convinced me to purchase a certain perfume. I had never really bought this kind of perfume up until that day nor was I too sure about saving any money, but one thing was for sure that the perfume would last for a considerably longer period of time.\n\nAnyway, I purchased the expensive perfume, mainly because my friend had convinced me to do so. Of course, I also went along with his idea because I felt that it was a very nice perfume, and it would help me to change my taste in perfume for a little while.  Finally, I bought it also because I wanted to build a good rapport with the new store so that if I would ever go back to that store again in the future, it would offer me some better price."

The Sony laptop I bought is a third-generation i7 laptop and it came with the original Windows 8 operating system. I bought it 3 months ago from the computer market. This is the largest computer and electronics market in our city. I bought it from the Sony showroom and they gave me 2 years warranty on my laptop. \n\nYes, I had to save money to buy it. My previous laptop was getting out-of-date and I needed a new laptop with a better configuration. I finalised my budget after comparing the prices and brands 7-8 months ago and I started saving money from then.\n\nMy father has given me 50% of the price and the remaining half came from my savings. I saved the money from the amount I earn from my part-time job and a portion of the money was saved from the monthly expense I got from my parents. Thus I saved the amount required to purchase the laptop in my bank account and withdrew the whole amount before I purchased it.\n\nI was so happy to have this new laptop even though it cost me more than I could afford as a student."

So, having a job that helps make the world a better place is never exactly a priority for most of us.  But, thankfully, some people still take these noble jobs to make this world a better place, and the job of a journalist seems to be one such job.\n\nOf course, we all know what the roles of a journalist really are. But, just to refresh our memories again, it is a job that helps gather the news and information about the events and incidents in and around our world in an objective manner so that we can make an informed decision to live our life. At least, that’s what I thought about it when I learned about this job a long time ago by reading some books and watching some TV news. But, as time progressed, I started to realize that it is just not like any other regular traditional job in a sense it doesn’t exactly create any “tangible” products or offer any services that people use on a daily basis.\n\nIn fact, it is more than a job as it also seems to be a vehicle of change – changes that our society needs to survive and flourish in a healthy manner. So, from that point of view, it is also a very important job because it keeps us informed constantly about the good things and the bad things of our society to help us understand how much we have actually evolved as “humans” as opposed to becoming some four-legged creatures.\n\nAnyway, I think that this job helps make the world a better place by encouraging us to do good things by publishing positive news on various media outlet while also challenging us to do better by exposing the ugly truths of our society. This job essentially acts as a “tonic” in order to help our society to march forward toward its ultimate goal which is to “live and let live”."

There are many different jobs that put great contributions making the world better but in my opinion, the contribution teachers make to educate people is very noble and has a really great contribution towards the society and civilisation.\n\nI mostly learned from my own experience and thought about the great contributions the teachers have made and are still making. I learned about teaching professions in my childhood in a conversation I had with my mother. I asked many questions to my mother about the jobs teachers do and why do they do it, and my mother answered those questions. Later on, I have read many articles in newspapers and the internet and have learned the great gift the teachers are giving to our society.\n\nIt is an inevitable fact that education is the main power and backbone of a nation and teachers are the craftsmen to make a nation educated. From our childhood, we start learning from our family and surroundings and later on we go to different educational institutes to learn and acquire knowledge. Teachers not only teach us the academic lessons but also teach us the importance of educations. On top of that, teachers inspire us, motivate us, teach us morality, honesty and many other aspects of life. The things we learn from our schools and teachers shape us what we become. Without their hard work and contribution, we would have been savage, uneducated and uncivilised.\n\nThe teachers are the human engineers who are continuously working on creating the next leader, scientist, writer, architect, doctor, researcher, pilot, artist, musician, and composer etc. who would navigate the nation. Without their unmatched effort and contribution, the world would have been a different place with a lot more problems. Possibly no other profession contributes to making the world a better place as much as the teaching profession does."

At least, I felt like that when I heard a piece of good news over the phone about a few months ago.\n\nThe news was about getting a new job. It was certainly good news because my nephew was searching for a job for a considerable period of time after finishing university. But, unfortunately, even though, he was getting a lot of interview calls, no company was actually offering him any good job. Of course, earlier he had got some \"jobs-offers\" here and there, but he didn’t exactly like those jobs because he was aiming for much better opportunities.\n\nBy the way, my nephew is a brilliant student, and he also has some very good grades, so it is only natural for him that he would aim for better opportunities. Anyway, after trying to find a better job for a long time, my nephew got so frustrated that at some point, he actually thought of giving up searching for a job and starting some kind of business. But, as a good uncle, it was only me who was asking him to be a little more patient. So, when he got a job offer letter from one of the prestigious private companies of my country, he immediately decided to call me over the phone in order to give me the good news when I was away from the town for an important job.\n\nAnyway, I felt really great about the good news because it would finally give some hope of life to my beloved nephew.

So, I surely would like to thank you for offering me the opportunity to describe a school which I attended in the past.\n\nThe school, I want to talk about, is a high school in Deptford, London, which I attended from the year of  2007 to 2012. Being located at the heart of one of the best metropolitan cities in the world, this particular state-funded secondary school attracted students, both boys and girls, from all origins and backgrounds as well as from all walks of life. However, most of the students there were from working-class people. It specialized in Humanities, with English, Citizenship and Drama. It is a five-storey building, with multi-use games area, big playground in the front and 150 cycle parking spaces. And, of course, it also has a big library and large stadium for Deptford green community leisure. Besides, the school also has wireless technology throughout the entire school buildings (meaning students can use laptops when necessary in each and every classroom), a fitness gym, a sound recording studio and radio station, light and spacious classrooms which are 25% larger than statutory regulations, and a tiered seating conference hall with lecture desks which can act like a performance hall. \n\nIf I remember correctly, around 12 hundred students used to attend this great secondary school when I was studying there. Anyway, what I really liked about my secondary school was that the teachers were really qualified and very helpful. The school management was very friendly also. The infrastructure was amazing, and we had our own badminton, basketball and football teams who played really well. Besides, there were extra classrooms for community tutoring groups which were accessible for all weak students. Finally, I would never forget about the delicious and free bowl of porridge for breakfast which was provided in the mornings, alongside a range of other refreshments. However, I didn’t like the school uniform colour which every student needed to wear."

We had a big hall room where we gathered during the tiffin time and enjoyed gossiping with friends. The large green fields were one of our favourite places and we often played and ran there. The school provided us tiffin and snacks which we really liked.\n\nThings I did not like about the school are only a few and among them, the noise produced by the nearby road was the most irritating thing for us. Since the school was situated near the main road, sound pollution was a dire issue for us. I hated the fact that the class started from 6:30 am and because of that, I had to wake up very early in the morning. There were 2-3 teachers who had ferocious characteristics and I abhorred their rude behaviours sometimes.\n\nI mostly enjoyed the time I spent in the school. I had many good friends and I liked the environment and teachers o this school."

    "Answer": "Different people like to define success differently. For example, some would define success as owning a very nice house while others would define it as having a nice job. But, the success story, which I am about to share here today is a bit different because it doesn’t involve any material gains. Rather it is about becoming successful in giving up a particularly bad habit.\n\nWell, of course, some people may not consider giving up smoking a success, but for me, it was a big success. In fact, for a person, who has smoked for more than 10 years, giving up the habit after trying only for a few months was a huge success. However, I didn’t quite have the urge to achieve this success until I became sick about a year ago. In fact, I was suffering from problems like bronchitis and short-breathing so much, because of excessive smoking, that I even needed to go to the hospital a few times within just a period of 6 months.\n\nBy the way, the doctor advised me to give up smoking as soon as possible about 5 years ago because of the similar kinds of problems, even though not as serious as the recent illness, but I simply shrugged off the advice. But, apparently, the decision proved out to be very costly later on as I found out that I had done some serious damage to my lung. So, it was time for me to behave like an adult for the sake of my health and stop smoking completely. Initially, of course, I felt very edgy and frustrated because I couldn’t enjoy my favourite thing (that is smoking), but slowly and slowly, I got used to it by keeping myself busy with other things like painting and taking photography.\n \nAnyway, this success was very important in my life as it helped me become a more healthy and productive person. Besides, it also helped me reconnect with my family members like a responsible person. Finally, this success also helped me to save up some money which I was wasting in buying smokes for me."

    "Answer": "The way we look at our success and the way people look at it always differ. We sometimes consider our small and personal achievements are great successes while to others; those might not be counted as successes at all. Thus we judge ourselves in a different angel than people do. However, some successes are exemplary and inspiring. The success that I achieved and would like to talk about is my involvement in a social welfare activity that I greatly feel proud of.\n\nThe local authority of our hometown once planned to build a multi-storied shopping mall in a public park. Some of us suddenly noticed that they have started cutting the trees and we later learned that they will build a shopping mall there. We instantly planned to protest if though we knew that it would be complicated issues and we have little power against the powerful authority that has planned to destroy the park and make it a profitable marketplace. We were initially 5-6 persons involved in the protest and we let the community people know about the mischievous plan the authority has taken. Later 20 more people joined our group. We went to the local authority, journalists; police station met local politicians and social workers and presented our view and abhorrent plan the authority has taken. Because of our protests, the tree cutting was halted. Later we found that more community people joined us and news has been published in the local newspapers regarding this issue.\n\nThe park was the only green place and recreation centre for the local people. People came there in the morning and evening to walk, run and do other short of social activities. Children enjoyed playing there and some social programs held there. A large number of birds stay at the trees of the park and destroying this park would have been a serious threat to our environment as there were more than 300 different trees there. It was not easy to fight with the powerful authority and we had to struggle a lot for more than 6 months. We finally went to court and got the decree against destroying the park.\n\nThis whole event occurred 5 years back when I was a fresh college student. I still consider my involvement to save the part as a great thing I did and being able to save the park and nature is a big success in my life."

    "Answer": "Watching TV is one of my most favourite forms of entertainment because of the convenience and the diversity in entertainment it provides. But, unfortunately, I don’t really have much time to watch TV because of my work. Still, I try to enjoy different kinds of programmes on it, especially, if they are aired by “National Geographic” channel.\n\nAnyway, since National Geographic channel is one of the most popular TV channels in the world for the thinking minds, it doesn’t really need any introduction. Still, just for academic purpose, this TV channel is an American pay television network which provides non-fictional TV programmes like documentaries with factual contents,  involving nature, science, culture, and history, plus some reality and pseudo-scientific entertainment programmes. Then, its primary sister network worldwide, including the United States, is Nat Geo Wild, which focuses on animal-related programming only.\n\nIn fact, the programmes on National Geographic TV channel are so diversified, as well as educational, interesting, informative, entertaining and serious, that once a person watches its programmes, he or she becomes hooked to it. Of course, this TV channel is not without some controversy, but it is also true at the same time that no other channels let us see and explore our world in the way that national geographic does, whether we see how a tiger hunts in a forest or how Antarctica melts. Anyway, even though, it is my favourite channel, I don’t get to watch it more than twice a week or so.\n\nThe national geographic channel is my favourite channel, mainly because of the quality and the contents it provides. Besides, all the programmes on this TV channel are so unique and educational that I can watch it with my entire family while enjoying some quality family time together. However, the best thing that I really like about this TV channel is that it is never afraid to bring the “truth” out in the light about any issues even though they may prove out to be controversial. So, again, National geography TV channel rocks."

    "Answer": "I do not watch TV that much but it is a great electronic and mass media for education and entertainment. Sometimes I watch TV, mostly in my free time and among the channels I watch, 'Discovery Channel' is my favourite one. Whenever I held the TV remote control in my hand, I look for either a news channel or Discovery channel. This is the channel I watch more often than any other channels. I watch it for 4-8 hours per week. On my day off, if I am in front of the TV, I watch the great educational and recreational programs that this channel broadcasts. \n\nIt broadcasts mainly documentary programs focusing on popular science, technology and history. But recently they have started showing some other types of programs like reality shows and pseudo-technologies and entertainments. There are some unique programs that they present to their audiences like Myth Busters, Unsolved History, automobiles, and occupations etc. This channel started broadcasting from 1985 and has become one of the most popular TV channels in the world because of their emphasis on high-quality programs.\n \nI like this TV channel because of the programs and documentaries they present. Most of the programmes are thoroughly enjoyable and offer lots of information to the viewers. This is one of the great sources for me to learn history, technology and other educational knowledge. The picture quality is really nice and this channel is easily available via the cable service providers. I found this channel really interesting and I can learn many new things watching it."

    "Answer": "Having friends in our life is important because they complement us in many ways. Therefore, it is also equally important we choose our friends carefully, based on certain qualities. One such quality, which I really admire in my friends, is positive thoughts and attitude.\n\nActually, carrying positive thoughts and attitude is such a rare and precious quality that one would actually need dozens of pages to highlight its importance. It is these positive thoughts and attitude of a person that motivate him to achieve and accomplish all sorts of things in life. I used the phrase “all sorts of things” here to underscore the fact that while common people tend to do take care of only the so-called important tasks seriously in life, the people with positive thoughts and attitude take even the so-called little and unimportant things seriously, in addition to the things that are deemed generally important.\n\nSo, I must say that I am really glad that almost all of my friends carry this great quality in them because they have helped me get through a lot of challenges in my life. By the way, I didn’t understand the importance of this rare and gifted quality, until I started my second job when my boss told me that he couldn’t care any less about my performance at my job as long as I was trying my best to carry a positive attitude in me. In fact, he even lectured me once for a good 30 minutes to teach me about how to remain positive. And, it was after that little valuable lecture that I started to become selective in picking my friends.\n\nAnyway, I like this great quality in all of my friends because they always bring out the best in me, even when things look rather bleak for me, in order to face the tough challenges in this modern, tough and complicated world. Besides, my friends with this rare quality in them always make me happy and smile by helping me understand the fact that life is too short to remain sad and unhappy."

    "Answer": "There are several qualities which I expect to have in my friends and among them, truthfulness is the quality I admire most. In my opinion, the most important and fundamental quality that makes the bond among friends stronger is the truthfulness. If a friend tells me the truth, no matter what I would stick to his/ her friendship. The trustworthiness can exist only the truthfulness persists between two friends.\n\nI sometimes evaluate others with the way I judge myself. For instance, I would tell the truth to my friends and I know this would make them rely on me and have faith in me in the long run. Similarly, I want my friends to tell the truth always. The lies can never make friendship strong and in fact, if a friend finds that his best friend has lied to him/ her, the friendship would become shaky.\n\nI strongly feel that friends should first tell the truth and then other important factors would exist among them. I believe a good friend should never lie and thus the truthfulness among friends strengthens their trust, reliability, dependency and belief. For all these reasons I like this quality."

    "Answer": "We all have different kinds of conversations in our daily life. While some of these conversations take place among us rather casually, the others become a bit formal because of the way they affect our lives in one way or another. Today, I would like to talk about one such conversation which affected my life also.\n\nThe conversation, I am talking about, took place about 10 years ago between me and my parents, when I started my second job. Prior to that conversation, I don’t recall having any other conversation with my parents which involved my financial future and the general direction of my life. But, on that occasion, my parents did just that when I decided to move out of their house and live somewhere close to my new job.\n\nBy the way, the new job, I started about 10 years ago, was about 60 kilometres away from my parents’ house, and it would take me more than an hour to reach my new office in a bus. Thinking about the long commute hours, I had decided that I would rent a home close to my new job in order to save some time. But, after learning about my decision, my parents talked with me for about 30 minutes to explain the pros and cons of moving to a new place. At the end of that conversation, they actually asked me to stay with them for another few years or so, because that would help me save up some money since I wouldn’t have to pay any money to rent my own place. They even suggested that I shouldn’t have that much trouble to commute to and from my new job since I was still young and healthy.  Needless to say, I had listened to the advice of my parents.\n\nAnyway, I am glad that I actually had that conversation with my parents because that indeed helped me understand the value of saving money. Besides, I also understood from that conversation that one would need to have a minimum level of tenacity and resolve to gain a certain level of financial freedom in life."

    "Answer": "The conversation that I had with my principal in my first year of college was something that I will never forget and this conversation had positively affected my course of actions later in my life. It was about my involvement in the college debate team.\n\nI was an active debate team member in my school level and before my board final exam; I quit the team and was not involved with the debating team any longer. After getting admitted to college, I got busy with my study and other stuff and did not consider doing the debate anymore. Our college participated in an inter-college debate competition and started recruiting members for the two debate team needed. I did not show any interest in that and after our class teacher heard from my friends that I used to debate, he asked me to join. But I was determined not to join and very politely told no to my teacher.\n\nThen one day I was summoned by the principal of our college and I had no clue why he could possibly call me. I went to meet him in his office room and he started the conversation then. He told me some of the stories of his life and experiences and thus the conversation started getting longer. He did not try to convince me to join the debate team what I initially thought he would do. Rather we had a conversation on our lives, country, and international issues, how things have changed, educational and political systems of our country etc. Then just before my departure he asked me to consider joining the debate team and he gave me some really convincing reasons for that.\n\nI was impressed with his friendly attitude, the experiences and knowledge he had. He gave some of the unavoidable reasons why I should actively participate in the debate and get in touch with the team. After 2-3 days, I joined the debate team and I started feeling better. I had a passion for debating but abandoning it was a decision I took wrongly. The conversation I had with our principal showed me a reason to correct this mistake.\n\nThis whole conversation and the event had a major influence on my life. I had been an active debater for the next 5 years and somehow my involvement in debating influenced me to study in History at university-level though I was supposed to do my graduation in Physics. Thus the conversation indirectly and to some extend directly had a big influence in my life and have affected very positively in my opinion."

Such activities may include spending time with all of my friends (and trust me, I have plenty of them) to enjoying some video games all by myself, and any other activities in between. But, today, I would like to talk about an activity which is little unique in a sense that not too many people do that.\n\nThe name of this activity, I would like to call, is “video recording” – video recording of different kinds of interesting and unique TV programmes when I don’t have anything else to do. In fact, I have been enjoying this activity for more than 7/8 years since the time I started my career as a Media Communication Specialist at one of the leading advertising firms in my country.\n\nBy the way, one of the things, which I have to do as a Media Communication Specialist, is to understand and explain the visual effects of different kinds of TV programmes, especially, the programmes like drama, serials and advertisements. In other words, I needed to watch a lot a TV sometimes for professional purpose. But, as I kept doing that, I suddenly figured out that TV programmes change in their costumes and styles in the course of time, even though, they air basically the same kind of programmes with the same kinds of substances and messages. And that’s when I also figured out that these changes, which both can be very subtle and visible, could be preserved as some great source of reference and information about the fashion and styles of a certain period of time or age.   \n\nAnyway, I enjoy doing this activity because it allows me to compare the different kinds of communication styles and the qualities of different kinds of TV programmes through the prism of time. It also allows me to recall some of the good memories of the past that are associated with watching a certain kind of programmes. I think that more people should take this activity as one of their favourite pass time activity."

Yet, I maintain some of the activities I really enjoy. One such activity is hanging out with friends during my day-offs. We often meet at a place in the evening and enjoy our time. Sometimes we meet at a public place like a park or a field and sometimes we go to watch the theatre. \n\nI mostly do it with my close friends and we have 4-5 such friends who meet each other on our day-offs. I enjoy spending times with my friends as they are my long time friends and have a good understanding. I enjoy the topic we discuss or even the chit-chat we have in our conversation. As all of us got busy over time, we can’t meet very often and our meeting on our day-offs helps us maintaining our social gathering and friendship. We often plan to go to worth watching theatrical performance and movies and enjoy our time. \n\nThis is indeed a good activity, at least to me, as I value their friendship and enjoy their company. Good friends are like treasures in life as I have often found their help in times of distress and need.

    "Answer": "I have heard a lot about one of the legendary authors of all time, who is famously known as William Shakespeare, but, unfortunately, I am yet to read many of his books. Of course, it is not like I have read books of all famous writers in the world, but this gentleman deserves an extra bit of attention from all the book lovers around the world, simply because he is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist.\n\nThe book, I want to read by this author, is called The “Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark”, which is often shortened to Hamlet. The book is a tragedy, which was written by this legendary English poet, sometime between 1599 and 1601.\n\nBy the way, it also happens to be Shakespeare's longest play with 30,557 words. Anyway, the book tells about a revenge story, based on a popular legend, where the ghost of a murdered king comes to haunt the living with tragic consequences. Of course, in the story, the ghost doesn’t take the revenge himself, but rather he asks his own son, Hamlet, to avenge his murder by killing the new king, Hamlet's uncle. Hamlet feigns madness, contemplates life and death, and seeks revenge. His uncle, fearing for his life, also devises plots to kill Hamlet. At the end of the story, a fight breaks out where the King, Queen, Hamlet's opponent and Hamlet himself are all killed. By the way, I am not only planning to read this particular book in the next few months but also another book called “The Merchant of Venice” by this same author.\n\nAnyway, I want to read this book, mainly because I want to learn a little more about 16th century England and Europe as a whole. I want to read this book also because it is considered to be one of the greatest tragedies, ever written, as well as the greatest play of England’s national poet, who pretty much changed the landscape of English literature forever.  Finally, I want to read this book also because it will further enrich my English language skills."

I have read almost all of the books written by this talented author except 2-3 including 'Fools Die'. I am yet to read this book mostly because this book was not available in the market and library. \n\nI have loved and thoroughly enjoyed all the books by this author and he is a gifted storyteller who can easily keep you awake till tale night with his books. Though I have not read this book 'Fools Die', I am sure that would be another great book that I would enjoy very much. I read the summary of this book and that seemed a very interesting story indeed. No other writer has been able to tell stories of Mafia families and crime world like this writer did. His stories and characters are so profound that some people believe that he must have some contacts with the mafia and some of the stories must be real! The fiction novel 'Fools Die' was first published in the year 1978 and the plot encircles the worlds of gambling, film industry and publishing.\n\nI would definitely read any other books I have not read written by the same author. Since the writer is not in this world anymore, we won't have any new book written by him but I would like to read any book I have not read by this author."

    "Answer": "Today, I would like to talk about one of the popular food dishes in Malaysia, which I don’t only enjoy eating, but also know how to cook.\n\nThe name of this food dish is called “Nasi Biryani”.  It is a rice dish flavoured with spices and rose water. The word “nasi” means rice in Malay. By the way, the aromatic rice (ie. Basmati rice) is the base for all kinds of meat biryanis. Of course, one can also serve it separately, topped with his or her choice of curries. But as far as my nasi biryani is concerned, I prefer it separately with my choice of curries on top of it. \n\nAnyway, the ingredients, needed to cook this dish, may include ingredients like vegetable oil, 3 large shallots (peeled and thinly sliced), butter, cinnamon stick, 2 'star anise',  3 cardamom pods, 6 cloves, 500 gm basmati rice, 80 gm golden raisins, 2½ cups water, 1 teaspoon of salt, ground turmeric, rose essence or kewra (an extract from pandanus flowers) water, and finally,  and some toasted cashew nuts.\n\nAnyway, after learning about its cooking methods from my sister, I have cooked this delicious dish many times. To cook this dish, first, fry sliced shallots in vegetable oil until they get a golden colour. In the same pot, fry all the spices, mentioned above, in melted butter, for about 1 to 2 minutes until the fragrance starts to come out. Then, boil the rice in water after adding golden raisins in it. Later, add some salt with them and cook them in medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes until all water is absorbed is required. Then, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and let cook for another 5 minutes. Finally, mix ground turmeric with 1 tablespoon hot water in a small cup while mixing rose essence or kewra water within another. Now sprinkle both mixtures onto the rice and fluff rice gently with a spatula. Cover and allow the rice to sit for another 10 minutes. Garnish the cooked rice with fried onions and cashew nuts. Your delicious \"nasi biryani\" should be ready to be served now!"

    "Answer": "I am not a good cook and I know very little about cooking and related stuff. Yet, I know how to cook only a few common dishes as I had to cook sometimes during my university life/ college life. One such dish is the boiled rice and mutton curry.\n\nTo cook this dish we would need rice, mutton, some spices, onion, vinegar, mustard, water, oil, salt and some other basic cooking ingredients. I probably learned it from my mother's cooking. As I have seen my mother cook this very dish countless times, the idea and cooking of this dish came to me from there. When I cooked this dish for the first time, I actually recalled what my mother did and I followed the memories I had regarding my mother cooking this dish. So in a sense, I learned it from my mother, though she did not teach me how to cook this dish directly.\n\nTo cook this dish, one need to clean and wash the rice and then boil it in the water for about 30 minutes. At the end the cook has to check the water level and if needed s/he would need to drop off the extra water. Thus the boiled rice item would be prepared. To make it tasty, we sometimes use a very small portion of ghee/ tasty butter to give it a good scent and a delicious taste.\n\nFor the mutton curry part, the cook must wash the mutton first and then keep it in the water for about 20 minutes. After the mutton is washed neatly, it would have to put in the amalgam of the 3-4 spices, oil and vinegar. After that water would be added to this and the cook has to wait for 20-30 minutes before it would be ready to be served along with the rice.\n\nI would say this is an easy dish to cook. It does not require so many ingredients or so many complex processes for cooking. This is a tasty dish that can be prepared easily and the taste would be great if everything goes alright."

But, still, whenever I get a free evening, I try to enjoy it to the fullest, either by watching some TV with my family or going out with some friends at a coffee shop.\n\nBut, if I compare watching TV with hitting a coffee shop, I would say that I enjoy watching TV more often in the evening than hitting a coffee shop. I think that everybody knows that TV these days airs a lot of interesting kinds of programmes throughout the whole day and night, especially, if someone has the satellite or cable televisions. All one needs to do is to find the programmes of his or her choice, which are aired at a time, when the person is not occupied with any other things or tasks and just keep watching them until he or she gets tired.\n\nI am not sure about other homes, but my TV offers me the opportunity to try more than 100 TV channels to find my favourite programmes. By the way, the programmes, I enjoy watching, are mostly funny and comedy types unless, of course, there are some serious types of educational programmes which involve some invention or discovery at the space or some other unknown planets.  By the way, I like to watch TV with all of my family members while also joking with them and enjoying some of our favourite snacks or drinks at the same time.\n\nAnyway, I enjoy watching TV as often as I can during the evening because it helps me unwind greatly after spending a long and eventful day at my work.

People who love Indian, Chinese, Tai and Mexican foods and like to be in a nice place with a calm environment should come here and try their foods. Since the environment is quiet and the interior is well-designed, people from all ages would enjoy being here. The playground at the ground floor is specifically built for children's amusement and the kids would also enjoy being in this restaurant."

    "Answer": "Well, let’s see... I have a number of movie names in my watch list, but I don’t think that I would ever be able to watch all of them in my lifetime, primarily, because they literally come from all the countries of our world. In fact, I even told myself once as a young boy that I would watch at least 5 most popular movies from each country and each language. But, for now, let’s just talk about only one movie which I really like to watch in the near future.\n\nThe name of this movie is called “Braveheart”. Well, I have never really watched this movie before, so I can’t really be spot on when talking about this movie. But, from what I have learnt about this movie so far from my friends and movie magazines, I can say that it is by far one of the most epic stories ever told.\n\nAnyway, this movie is about a Scottish hero, named William Wallace, who leads a revolt against the British rule and oppressions during the 14th century in order to free Scotland from the British rule. But, Ironically, Wallace's goal of independence for Scotland is thwarted by the region's own aristocrats, a well-treated bunch with investments in England. Betrayed by his high-born countrymen, Wallace assassinates a number of them before he's captured and handed over to the English for public torture and execution. Wallace is unyielding to the end, and his example shames the Scottish prince Robert the Bruce to lead a larger, more successful revolt later in Wallace's name. And, that pretty much sums up the story of the movie.\n\nAnyway, I would like to watch this movie, mainly because the film was the big winner at the 68th Annual Academy Awards, where it won six Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cinematography). By the way, very few Hollywood movies have achieved such feat. I want to watch this movie also because there is a few historical truth in this movie as far as the issue of the past relationship between the British people and Scottish people is concerned."

    "Answer": "I have a must-watch list of movies and I would like to watch them all over time. One such movie that I would like to see is 'Citizen Kane'. This movie was directed, co-written, produced and starring by Orson Welles who is considered to be one of the greatest producers of all time. I have heard and read reviews of this movie and a few times asked the CD/ DVD rent shops if they have this movie or not. Somehow I am yet to enjoy this movie. This is an American drama film that was released in 1941. This film is particularly critically acclaimed because of some innovations like cinematography, music and narrative structure. According to many reliable reviews and lists, it is considered to be the greatest film ever made in Hollywood.\n\nThough I have not watched it, I have read the storyline in rotten tomato and IMDB. The story examines the life and legacy of Foster Kane. In the story, the wealthy newspaper publisher Kane dies while holding a snow globe and utters 'Rosebud', while living alone in his vast estate. The globe fell down from his hand and smashes and his dead becomes sensational news around the world. A newspaper reporter tries to find out about his life and in particular to reveal the meaning behind his last word 'Rosebud'.\n\nHe then starts interviewing Kane's friends and associates and Kane's story unfolds in a series of flashbacks. The journalist meets a person who served as Kane's guardian during his childhood. He then learns about Kane's childhood and later from Kane's business manager to learn more about him. Flashbacks reveal that Kane spent his childhood in poverty and then later he inherits a property that his mother got by chance. At the age of 25, he enters into the newspaper business and finally takes control of the newspaper. He finally joined a political party and a dispute ruined his political career. Kane spends his last years in a solitary estate and there was no relative or wife around. There he dies and his butler hears Kane says \"Rosebud\" as his last word in his life.\n\nAfter his death, his vast amounts of belongings are classified. During this time the reporter thinks that he is unable to solve the mystery of the 'Rosebud' and thinks that would remain unsolved forever. He concluded that Kane was the man who archived everything he wanted and lost them all. Maybe Rosebud is the thing he could not get or lost. At the end of the movie the mystery was solved for the audiences and it reveals that Rosebud was the name of the sledge from Kane's childhood which was actually an illusion to the only time of his life when he was truly happy. The sledge was considered to be a piece of junk and was burned in a basement by Xanadu's departing staff.   \n\nThis was a truly amazing film that I thoroughly enjoyed. The plot, the storyline, the acting and production and making of the film was exemplary and I would like to watch it as soon as I can."

    "Answer": "My country has predominantly been an agricultural country even though, in recent times, industrialization has made its way in many parts. So, it is fair to say that I am more than familiar with a few crops that are grown in my country, and paddy/rice is one of them.\n\nTalking about rice, this particular crop is pretty popular throughout the whole continent of Asia where the majority of its people eat rice as their main food.\n\nBy the way, rice is regarded as the first cultivated crop of Asia. In fact, preserved rice grains were found in China around 3000 B.C.  Apart from Asian countries, rice is also grown to some extent in Africa, the Caribbean and Latin American countries, Australia and Europe. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labour costs and high rainfall, as it is labour-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems.\n\nBut, before anything, one needs proper seedling of suitable varieties of rice, which suit the environment, in order to cultivate rice. Once the seedlings are grown at a certain height, they are then planted on the soil after preparing it by ploughing and harrowing it properly.\n\nAnyway, I like everything about this particular crop because it has lots of usages. Needless to say, when rice is grown, their green look renders the landscape of my country so beautiful that one just would keep looking at it while the wind moves them gently. Besides, they look stunningly beautiful when the paddy sheaf become gold and ready for harvesting.  \n\nWell, this crop is very important for my country because it meets the demand of the main food and carbohydrate for millions of the population of my country. Besides, still, the majority of the population of my country are dependent on this crop for their livelihood and economic needs. Finally, rice is an important crop in my country also because its straw is predominantly used as a feed for the livestock all over my country."

    "Answer": "Paddy is a common type of crop in our country that I am familiar with. Rice is the staple food in our country and our food demand is mainly supported by this crop. Paddy is grown in almost all part of our country. But the north part of the country is particularly the best place to produce the best quality of rice. The paddy plant is grown in a fertile land where plenty of water supplies is available. But it can't grow in water.  \n\nThe people of our country eat rice as our main food and because of this plant we get our food supply. This is the most important crop in our country and probably the most important one as well. If we can't grow plenty of paddy plant we won't have enough rice and as a consequence, we won't have enough food supply for our people. Every nation has its own main crop and their economy is much influenced by it and for our country, paddy has similar influences on our economy. I like this paddy plant as it looks beautiful in the green field. The golden paddy and the green plants look amazing when it dances with the rhythm of the wind. I also like it because it is the main food for us. We are heavily dependent on this plant for our daily food and economic growth.\n\nThe importance of this plant and the crop it gives is really huge. If we did not have this plant in our country, we would have a real problem fulfilling our daily food needs. The crops we get from the plant are our main crop and supply us our daily needs of foods. For all these reasons I like this plant and the crop it provides."

    "Answer": "I respect all parents, and I also like to believe that they are all very good parents in one way or another because all parents love their children with their life. But, I guess that some parents are a bit serious with their parenting skills than others, and today I would like to talk about one of those parents, who I have known for quite some time.\n\nThese parents are none other than parents of one of my close friends. After meeting them for the first time, when my friend had invited me to enjoy a special feast at his home, I got the feeling that they were not exactly like any other parents, I had seen before. By the way, back then, I and my friends were final year university students, and so we were already old enough to know what was best for us. But, when we were just about to eat our food, my friend’s mother started to describe the taste of each and every kind of food, they had cooked for us, apparently, in an effort to let me know what kinds of foods I could eat, and what kinds of foods I could avoid if needed to.  \n\nThen, when we were busy eating our foods, both the parents of my friend asked me if their son (my friend) treated me nicely since. At some points, after finishing the feast, they even asked me that if I was behaving nicely with my parents. After that, we had some more conversation among us, and all they asked me about was if I was comfortable enough at their house. In fact, from their talks, it would be difficult for someone to separate their own child from a child of some other parents.   \n\nI think that they are very good parents because they don’t forget for a moment about the well-being of not only their own child but also the friend of their child. Besides, I felt like, even the negative words and criticism from them somehow would prove out to be as some very positive messages because of the way, they communicate things."

Though they're not with us anymore for the last 3-4 years or so (God rest their souls in peace), I have known them for almost all of my life. They had 5 sons and daughters and all of them are good human, established in the society, doing good for people and are exemplary for others.\n\nMy grandfather was a government service holder and grandma was a housewife. They have cared for their children more than their lives. They made sure all of their children get proper education and lead a healthy life. They taught my uncles, father and aunts about humanity and kindness. They always treated their children as the most important things in their lives. Even when I was 10 or 11 years old, I found that my father shares many of his personal things with my grandpa as friends do. All of my uncles and aunts treated their parents with the utmost respect and surprisingly they were so frank and close to each other. Two of my uncles are doctors, 1 uncle is an architect, my father is a professor and my aunt is a lawyer. They are all doing great in their professions and for that their parents’ contribution worked as the primary factor.\n\nTo be good parents, father and mother need to primarily focus on their children's welfare and future. They need to devote themselves and carry out great responsibilities. They need to sacrifice their own lives and make sure that the children grow up in a good environment with proper education and morality."

    "Answer": "Childhood memories are always great – especially, the memories of the place(s) in which we grow up as children. So, I am really glad that I have been provided such a great opportunity to talk about a place in which, I didn’t just grow up as a child, but also hold it very dearly close to my heart.\n\nAnyway, the place, where I grew up as a child, was a small town. Well, I would describe it more like a city suburb, but it certainly had all the elements to offer happy living to a 7/8 years old child like me. By the way, prior to moving that city suburb, my parents actually used to live in one of the major cities of my country which was very crowded and noisy for the liking of them. So, they decided to move to a small town, where I grew up as a child, in order to offer us an opportunity to remain close to the environment of the countryside.\n\nSince the town in which I grew up as a child was small, everything was within my reach. For example, the breakfast place, movie theatre, and stadiums to enjoy all kinds of games were all in close proximity to my residence. Besides, if I rode on my bicycle for about 15 minutes on the brick-made pavement, I could easily visit a beautiful lake and cornfields. The streets, although they were few in numbers, there were very wide which made it easy for me to play with my bicycle.\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t live there anymore, and I am pretty sure that the place must have changed a lot in time because, after all, everything changes in time.\n\nAnyway, the place, I am talking about, was certainly a good place to grow up as a child. It was quiet and beautiful. It also had a very nice and clean environment. Besides, most of the people there were very friendly, and they didn’t mind about the business of their neighbours.  All in all, it was a very simple and nice town for a laidback child like me."

    "Answer": "I was born in a beautiful urban area called (...say the name of the place where you were born and spent your childhood...) and spent my childhood as well as adolescence there. This is a small urban area in the north part of the country. After I finished my college education, I moved to the capital city of the country for university education. I no longer live in my hometown but I often go there to visit my parents and other family members who still live there. \n\nThe place where I grew up is a beautiful urban area and is really a nice place to live in. It is situated beside a river and there are lots of open spaces, cornfields, paddy fields there. The green environment, comfortable weather, fresh air, scenic beauty and the simple life of people make it an ideal place. The modern facilities like internet, satellite connection, theatre, library etc are present there and yet one can stay close to nature there. The area is pollution-free, quiet and has some renowned educational institutes. \n\nIn a broader view, this urban area has not changed that much compared to the time I lived there but of course, some changes have occurred over the period. Many high rising buildings can be seen nowadays including some factories and industries.\n\nFarming was the main occupation of people which is no longer true and people now have diverse occupations. The numbers of fields and open spaces have gone down. People are widely accepting modern technology and businesses have expanded. The motorised transportations have replaced the manual ways of travelling. The lifestyle and fashions among the teenage generation seem very different than they used to be and the educational infrastructure and facilities have improved significantly than the time I had been there."

    "Answer": "There are many different types of people around us. While some of them are just simple and laidback type, the others like to try different kinds of things just for the fun of it. My friend, Rabid Hassan, is one such person who likes to try such things that other people wouldn’t exactly try under any normal circumstances.\n\nLet’s start with his “fish catching” activities. Well, how many people have you met who has a “weird” habit of catching fish in a lake by drowning himself into its water for more than a minute? Well, I bet that the answer would be “not too many”. Well, when it comes to Rabid Hassan, who I have known from my early high school days, he exactly does that in order to catch fish from the mud underneath the water of a lake only to find out, of course, that he has caught some big frogs or a big fat snake. Pretty scary, isn’t it?\n\nWell, it may be scary for “normal” people like us, but for an adventurous Rabid, it is just a fun thing to do. Of course, some people may find nothing so adventurous about catching a snake by mistake in a lake, but, I don’t think that they will say the same thing when they know that a person likes to ride his motorbike sometime on an uneven road at a speed which is close almost 100 kilometres per hour. By the way, I am talking about an uneven road where a regular person like me wouldn’t dare to ride his motorbike at a speed which is more than 50 kilometres per hour.\n\nAnyway, based on some of these activities, mentioned above, I think Rabid certainly is one of those persons who like adventures. Besides, I have seen him watching all kinds of TV shows on travel and adventures a lot of times. Finally, his intense desire to go to places, where nobody would dare to go, certainly makes him one of the adventurous persons around me that I can think of."

I know him from my childhood as he is my uncle and visits us often. I have always known him as a mysterious man who loves adventure and love to explore new things and places.\n\nFrom my childhood till now I've heard lots of stories about him and many of them are so exciting and adventurous that they can be easily converted to stories or movies. I often found my uncle disappears from home and then nobody knows where he has gone. All of a sudden he comes back and disappears again. I heard he only lets my grandpa know about his departure and his next exploration. He does not lead a conventional social life and still unmarried. He loves to read and visit different places. All the stories I heard about him from others and some of them from him seem very interesting and new to me.\n\nOnce he disappeared and came back with the story that he has found a place where ghosts can be found. Then again he came back with long-bearded and we learned that he lived in a forest with people for about 2 weeks. He knows a lot about people and the customs of our country. To me, the most adventurous thing I know he did is the time when he went to Nepal to reach the top of Mount Everest. There are so many other stories that I heard about him like killing a giant snake, swimming in a big river to rescue a victim, Egypt and many other places. Everything he does is a mystery to me and I have never met anyone more brave and adventurous than he is."

Needless to say, I also like this prominent figure and the 11th president of India, as he has written some famous books. Today I would like to talk about one of his famous books which I have recently read.\n\nThe name of this book is “Forge your Future”. Originally published in October of the year of 2014, has been acclaimed as one the most inspirational books of all time all over the world. The contents of this book are unique in a sense it is based on the mails and the questions which were asked by a number of people all over the country to Mr Abdul kalam. On the other hands, Mr Kalam, as usual, in his own beautiful and simple yet without missing the point, gave solutions to most complex questions that every young person go through in their lives.\n\nIt wouldn’t be an exaggeration to suggest that this book is a complete package or encyclopedia of all kinds of problems from individual to a nation, and Mr Kalam gave practical solutions to each and every problem, based on the experiences and struggles of his own life. In fact, the message of this book is if a person (Mr Abdul Kalam) like him can become educated, a prominent nuclear scientist and eventually the president of a great country like India, even after growing up in an isolated island of south India with sorts of obstacles, then anybody else can do it.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed reading this book, primarily because it much relates to regular persons like me. Besides, I really enjoyed the way the author chose his words in a very simple way in order to explain some of the toughest of the problems, any person or nation can face. All in all, it is one of the most inspirational books, I have ever read, because these days, I also say that “yes, I can do it too”."

    "Answer": "The book that I recently read is 'The Fortunate Pilgrim'. It is a novel by Mario Puzo which was first published in the year 1965. The writer Mario Puzo is well-known for his famous mafia book 'The Godfather' and was critically acclaimed for his book ’The Fortunate Pilgrim\". The writer had adopted the story of this novel based on his mother's immigration struggling for respectability in the United States. Mario Puzo himself considered this novel to be his finest though Godfather earned him much more fame and earning.\n\nThe novel tells the story of an immigrant family living in New York City. The mother of the family, Lucia Santa is the protagonist. It is her formidable will that steers the family members through the Great Depression and early years of World War ||. The story, places and the characters became so real that the readers can't stop wondering about them. The writer has been brilliantly able to tell a known story in a known tone that makes us feel them in our lives and that's why the characters and stories got the power keep a reader awake whole night. Mario Puzo has shown literacy excellence in this story.  \n\nI liked the book very much and finished it within 3 days. I have always been a great admirer of Puzo's writing and this one was a really different book than his famous mafia books. This is a book that touches the reader's mind. The story and the storytelling ability were so attractive that I had a very hard time putting the book down. Whenever I could I read the book and I thoroughly enjoyed it."

    "Answer": "There usually are so many objects in a household that we use for different purposes. Of course, not all of these objects are equally valued by us because some of them become old and worn out while the others look still new and decent. But, then, there are some objects in our households which we use for a long time but they still look very nice. Today, I would like to talk about one such object which my family has used and kept for a long time.\n\nThe object, which my family has kept for a long time, is a dining table. I have seen so many objects being replaced by newer items in my family for the last 15 years or so, but the dining table is still declaring its presence at our dining space aloud. Of course, the dining chairs around it have been changed on numerous occasions, but the dining table is still there.\n\nThis is a round-shape dining table which is made of “mahogany” wood. By the way, I must admit that this is one of the best mahogany wood tables I have ever seen. In fact, the wood of this particular table seems to be so seasoned and solid that I can hardly see any scratch on it, even after using it for almost 15 years. Of course, some regular painting works on this table, which was made at the shop of a local carpenter in my home town, have also helped it to remain smooth and in good shape for such a long time.\n\nAnyway, we all like the dining table, and it probably will remain in our dining space for another 210 years because it has some emotional value attached to it. In fact, my parents have kept this table for such a long time because it was made from the wood of a tree, which was planted by my paternal grandfather about 60 years ago. So, again, it is some emotional stuff. Besides, I think that my family has kept it for such a long time also because it still looks nice and decent after using for so many years."

    "Answer": "Some of the books which once owned and used by my grandfather are still kept with care in our house. My grandfather was a doctor and he kept his medical books and reference books with him. When he died, I was a 5 years old kid and can hardly remember things about him. But I heard that he was a great person and a first-class doctor. Everyone in our locality revered him and respected him very much. After his death, my father took one of his used tables, an armchair, and a big portrait of my grand-grandfather and some of my grandfather’s books as the remembrance of his memory. Among those things my grandfather’s medical books survived and are still reserved in our bookshelf.\n\nThese books would be more than 70-80 years old and we have those books on our shelf for the last 20 years. The caretakers sometimes bring out those books and clean those and finally put them on the shelf again. These books are mainly the academic books of my grandfather's medical college and some of the reference books for his practice as a doctor. I once opened some of the books when I was a school boy and found almost everything very obscure. Basically, they are medical science-related terms and that's why seemed jargon to me.\n\nMy family has kept these books as the souvenir of my grandfather's memory. My father was very beloved by my grandfather and I am sure he esteemed my grandfather very much. These books are the only tangible belongings my father has which were used by my grandfather and conveys my grandfather's reminiscences. Though these books do not have their material values, they are priceless to our family and remind us of the precious memory of our grandfather."

The occasion, of course, one of the major religious festivals of my country, which we were about to celebrate together. Today, I would like to about that visit in as much details as possible.\n\nMy uncle, the most senior older brother of my mother, is very much like a “word traveller”. No, seriously, he travels to at least 2/3 new places every year, whether travelling some places in his home country or abroad except, of course, he doesn’t travel to those places for fun or pleasure. But, rather, he travels to those places because of running his business.\n\nSo, yes, it is fair to suggest that he is a successful businessman, and he has at least 6/7 big and small business portfolios. Anyway, my uncle has visited us before several times to spend a few hours with us here and there, but this time around, he had actually informed us in advance that he would spend at least two days with us in order to celebrate the religious festival. Needless to say, we just couldn’t wait when I heard that news. So, we, especially my mother, started to cook our favourite foods, as well as the dishes that my uncle really liked. We even bought some gifts, like clothes and shoes, for my uncle as best as we could, because, we knew that there would be lots of gifts, coming on our way, when he arrives at our home, and we also needed to reciprocate a little by offering some of our own gifts to him.\n \nAnyway, when my uncle arrived, it was indeed a very happy occasion for all of us. In fact, those two days, which he spent with us, was precious for me and my siblings because he had shared some of his very fond memories with us when we all were little.

He was a famous writer and came to our home on the occasion of my older sister’s marriage ceremony. He was known to the father of the bridegroom’s senior brother and a well-known figure in our city. His name is Mr Jonathon Durik (…say a name you like…) and when he arrived all of us recognised him. The marriage ceremony was a big program and almost 200 people attended the ceremony. We had to prepare for the program for about a week before the due date. This ceremony was arranged in our own house and we had been tremendously busy for the occasion. A marriage ceremony is a big arrangement and my parents were very busy as well as sad that my sister would be leaving our house after her marriage. This was a big event and there were lots of things to be done. I had been so busy and had to greet and serve so many guests that I had a hard time concentrating.\n\nThe bridegroom and their relatives arrived and we got even busier. They introduced the guests to us and one of them was Mr Durik. I greeted him and helped him sitting on a comfortable couch. I got busy with other stuff and came to the guests from time to time to look after if he needed anything. I asked what type of foods he would prefer to eat and took him to the dining place. I had a short conversation with him and I told him that I have read some of his books and those were good stories. He smiled and asked me if I have enjoyed a book called ‘Shadows and smiles’. I understood that he was trying to figure out if I have really read his books or just told so to convince him. I told him the reasons I liked that book and I found him smiling. In the evening, just before the time of the guest’s departure, I brought a book written by him and asked if he would be kind enough to give me an autograph. He signed it and wrote a complementary note on the book.\n\nMy feelings about the occasion of my sister’s marriage was a mixture of happiness and sadness. I was happy that she was getting married as well as sad that she would not be with us the way she had always been. About the writer’s visit to our house, I would say that was exciting. Meeting a famous person and having a conversation with him/ her is always exciting and I felt the same. I wish I had more times to talk to him as that would have let me talk more about his writings and books."

But, after learning that a new and nice barber shop has been opened recently in my hometown from one of my friends, I also decided to pay a visit there and possibly also get a haircut. And, this is where I had an interesting conversation with the young owner of that barber shop.\n\nThe young owner, I am talking about, didn’t look any older than 20 years of age. But, he certainly had a way of communicating with his valuable customers. In fact, after talking to him for a while, anybody would think that the young barber shop owner was a very educated and smart person. But, in reality, he stopped going to college for further education after just passing his high school, simply because, according to him, studying beyond high school was not really necessary. And that’s when I felt that I needed to interject because I didn’t quite agree with him.\n\nSo, I asked him in a firm voice as to why he would think like that. In response, he just told me one doesn’t exactly need to study at a college or university to learn something new because one could actually learn those things just by reading some good books. After all, according to him, learning to read is all one needs to learn about the world around him or her, not some piece of papers called “certificate”.  I wanted to argue with him a little about the subject, but by that time, my hair cut was already done.\n\nI think that the conversation was interesting because even a 20-year-old can understand the fact very well that education has become a “commodity” these days where getting a certificate is becoming more important than actually learning.  It was also interesting in a sense that if a 20-year-old can deduce such conclusion, and a bold one in that, after just passing a high school, what possibly could go through his mind if ever chooses to finish his university education!"

    "Answer": "Last year when I was on my way to my hometown on a train, I had an interesting conversation with an unknown person and the conversation lasted for several hours. I live in the city and my hometown is about 7-8 hours away from the place I live in. I usually go to my hometown by bus but at that time I travelled on a train. I was in a second class compartment of the train and there were almost 10 other people travelling in the same compartment. I found a couple with 2 kids were sitting just opposite side of me next to me was sitting a person who seemed around 45 years old. I was sitting beside the window and he asked me to open it. He then thanked me and asked me about myself. The conversation went on and I learned that he is a senior employee of a large Government organisation. I was a bit confused that he was travelling in a second class compartment at cheap rent. \n\nHe started a topic about how the kids and young people from the new generation have little passion for learning and busy doing unproductive staffs. I started defending the young generation and expresses the difference the new generation has with their ancestors. The conversation started to turn into a debate and both of us used our logic and reasoning. The conversation was interesting and I was actively participating in it mostly because he had a good and polite way of conversation. He told his reasoning for this belief but when I showed him my logic, he did not protest just for the conversation’s sake. Rather he agreed that he learned many new facts about the new generation and their way of thinking and lifestyles. He also confessed that the generation gap is unavoidable and the positive changes should be accepted by them. Besides this main topic some other topic arrived like the political situation of our country, the educational system currently we have and what should be done to eliminate many of your major problems. \n\nThe conversation lasted for about 4 hours until he left the train at his station. I usually do not continue a longer conversation with strangers and often find people start talking about silly issues with no moral values. But the conversation I had with this person on the train was interesting and I enjoyed it. I felt like there is a big gap between the first generation and the new generation and both generations do not listen and think deeply about the other generation and that’s causing a huge gap between them. I enjoyed to learn many thoughts of our first generations and was appalled about some of the misconceptions. I was also relieved to learn that they have a positive attitude towards the changes which are for good reasons. His way of conversation was also positive and that’s why the overall conversation was enjoyable."

    "Answer": "While my journey in a train to my hometown, I had a very interesting conversation with a person named Smith (...say a name...) who was a journalist of a daily newspaper. I can't recall his last name but he was a man around 35 years and sat next to me on the train.\n\nI usually read books or listen to music during the long journeys I take. That day I was reading a book by Dan Brown and the person who sat next to me asked about the book. This is how the conversation started. The conversation was mostly about writers in general, the political condition in our country, the role of an ideal leader, journalism, corruptions and the major problems of our country. I rarely continue longer conversations with strangers but that conversation I had on the train was pretty different and lasted almost 3-4 hours.\n\nThis conversation was interesting mostly because of three reasons: one, the person I had the conversation with was a smooth-talking person with good knowledge and experience. Secondly, the way the conversation started and progressed was really interesting. I took my whole effort to debate on issues that I did not agree and also agreed with the notion that was similar to my viewpoint. Though this person was around 12 years senior to me, he never took any advantages of it and even he did not give any hint about it in the issued I disagreed with him. He treated me as an equally skilled opponent on many issues and listened to me very attentively. Finally, the place and circumstances when the conversation took place were really interesting and unusual. I must say, I learned many things from the opinions and experiences he shared that day."

    "Answer": "My country has rather a fertile land, so, naturally different kinds of plants are easily grown on its soil. Needless to say, some of these plants are rather useful, and among them, I would like to talk about one plant, which is not only popular and useful in my country, but also in many other parts of the world, especially the Asia and the African continent.\n\nThe name of this plant is more popularly known as “Mehndi” (or “Heena” tree in plain English) in my part of the world. Originally coming from the Egypt, Lawsonia inermis (the scientific name of Heena) is a flowering plant that can grow about 12 to 15 feet high. The plant grows best in heat up to 120-degree Fahrenheit temperature. In fact, this is the perfect temperature at which the plant can contain more dye. However, it may wilt in temperatures below 50-degree Fahrenheit. Further, it also grows better in dry soil than damp soil. As far as the leaves of this plant are concerned, they are in opposite decussate pairs and vary in sizes from approximately 2 to 4 cm. long.\n\nIts flowers are fragrant, produced in conical panicles that are 1040 cm long, 5 millimeter in diameter, and have four white petals each. The fruit is a dry capsule 68 mm diameter, containing numerous 12.5 mm seeds. By the way, this plant is grown, literally anywhere from a backyard and empty field to roof top. Anyway, I like this plant because it has lots of usages but it doesn’t exactly much effort or time to grow. Besides, it doesn’t really take much space to grow.\n\nAnyway, this is an important plant, mainly because its paste is used to paint different body parts of women on occasions like wedding ceremony, music and dance party, during important rites of passage, and in other times of joyous celebrations. Besides, this plant can also be used for medicinal purposes to treat ailments like headaches, stomach pains, burns, open wounds, fever, and even the prevention of hair loss! Indeed, it is an important plant to grow."

    "Answer": "Paddy plant or rice plant is a very common plant which is grown in our country. The farmers of our country cultivate it and it is grown in most of the places in our country. If you go to the countryside in the autumn season, you will find this paddy plant is dancing with the wind. This plant grows well in the fertile land and needs a good supply of water and sunlight. Rice is our chip food and we get rice from this paddy plant.\n\nThe paddy plant is a medium side plant which is thin and the leaves and body of this plant are green. Usually, the rice seed is green in early states and becomes yellow when it is ripe. Our economy heavily depends on our rice production. Our environment, soil, water and fields are in favour of producing a large quantity of rice each year.\n\nSince I live in a city now, I don't see these plants here but in my childhood whenever I went to visit our village, I found this plant in every field. Mile after mile farmers cultivate paddy plants and wish to get a good quantity of rice. These paddy plants are beautiful and create harmony with the wind if you hear closely. The dancing of this plant with the wind is something that would simply create a magical hallucination.\n\nI also like it because this plant provides us with rice which is our staple food. The taste and food value are quite good and it is our main crop. Every part of this plant has its usefulness. Our economy has a good dependency on the production of rice which we get from this plant. In our country, this is probably the most important plant we grow."

    "Answer": "If we come to think of it, we actually need a lot of things to make our house look beautiful and comfortable for living.  Furniture pieces are certainly one of those things, which we have to have at our homes, and today I would like to talk about one of those furniture pieces.\n\nThe furniture piece, I have at my home, is a large computer desk.  I bought it from one of the local furniture shops in my home town about a couple of years ago.  By the way, I am against buying new furniture unless it becomes completely unusable as a part of my campaign in order to conserve our natural resources, especially, the trees.  So, when I found out that my old computer desk was about fall into pieces because of its old age, I tried to take to some carpenter and fix it only, of course, to find out that I could actually buy a new computer desk with the repairing cost of the old desk.\n\nHence, my search began for a new computer desk and then eventually settled for the computer desk I currently have.  Anyway, the computer desk, I have now, is made of seasons and solid jackfruit tree wood.  The colour of this 4 feet wide, 6 feet long and 3 feet height table looks stunningly beautiful with its very light but shiny yellow colour. However, the best thing about this table is that it didn’t cost me a fortune even though many of my friends and relatives think that I paid a hefty amount of money to buy this elegant piece of furniture.\n\nWell, I like this furniture, primarily because it matches perfectly with the other pieces of furniture in my room.  Besides, I like it also because it offers me enough space, not only to keep my computer desk on it but also other items, which I use on a regular basis.  Finally, I like to use this furniture also because it has a perfect size, and I can set it in any corner of my room."

    "Answer": "I live in an apartment and there are various types of furniture there.  Some are purely utilitarian purposes and some are for beautification reasons only.  To me, my wardrobe is very useful furniture that I would like to talk about.\n\nThe wardrobe I have is big and has 5 drawers.  As far as I recall, I bought it 3/4 years ago from a large furniture shop at (...say a furniture market name....).  This piece of furniture is very handy for me.  I keep my dresses organised at the bottom three drawers.  The second drawer from the top is the place where I keep my very personal belongings including my diary and keys.  The top drawers are used for keeping important documents.  I keep my academic documents, money receipts and warranty papers of different newly purchased devices in this drawer.  All of the drawers are can be locked and this gives some additional security and privacy.\n\nI consider this piece of furniture very useful for me and that's why I like it.  It is a piece of good looking furniture that matches with the design and colour of other furniture in the room as well.  If I had not owned this furniture it would have been very difficult to keep my clothes arranges, valuable documents secured.  I have placed my CD player at the top of the wardrobe and the CD's are placed inside a drawer.  So you can guess how useful and utilitarian this furniture for me as I'm not using it only for placing dressed in the drawers.  From the time I bought it till now, this piece of furniture has been proven to be a very useful one for me."

    "Answer": "Realistically speaking, each and every event, be it small or big, affects the course of history in some subtle manners, and that’s probably why most of them go unnoticed. But, then, there are some events, we consider important, which are noticed by the entire world because of their sweeping effects on global history as well as our life. Today, I would like to discuss one such important event that completely changed our world.\n\nThe important event, I am talking about, is the “fall of Berlin wall”. Even though, it happened a long time ago, when I still was a young boy, in 1989, I can still remember the day vividly because I was actually watching the event live on our television. By the way, the Berlin wall was erected in 1961 by the then communist government of East Germany in order to stop the fleeing of its citizens to West Germany. This Berlin wall divided families who found themselves unable to visit each other. Many East Berliners were cut off from their jobs while the West Berliners kept demonstrating against the wall. This wall didn’t just divide the Berliners physically but also ideologically since the countries, divided by the wall, represented completely two different types of government systems. Even though nobody was really expecting such an unexpected and dramatic fall of the Berlin Wall, it had very significant effects in reshaping the international relations and the geopolitics of all the countries in the world.\n\nAnyway, it is an important event in the history of the world, primarily because it helped ease the tensions and cold war between the two blocks of the world: one was led the communist Soviet Union while the other block was led by the ‘so-called’ leader of the free world. The event also led the way in reducing the arms race which had cost both the countries (the USA and the USSR) and their supporting nations billions of dollars. Essentially, this event made the whole world much less dangerous and more peaceful for living."

    "Answer": "Second World War is an important event in history that has affected almost all of the countries of the world. It is also known as World War || and was a global war. This war lasted from 1939 till 1945 and was the most widespread war in world history. Almost 30 countries were directly involved in this war dividing into two major power called Allies and Axis. It is estimated that more than 100 million people were involved in this war. This devastating war caused 50 to 85 million fatalities and became the deadliest conflict in human history.\n\nThe war started on September the first, 1939 with the event when Germany invaded Poland. Just after 2 days Britain and France declared war on Germany. There are many political reasons that led the World War || but the most prominent reason was when Hitler invaded Poland, the conflict arose. United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Greece etc. were the main power of the Allies part while Germany, Japan, Italy, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria were the main power for the Axis.\n\nThis war involved Europe, Asia, Africa, Russia and most part of the world and because of the war the economy collapsed, industrialisation fell, a great number of people died, political aspect changed as an effect of the war and lots of nation had to reform their country. First, the nuclear bomb was used in this war and both parties invented and improved the war weapons. Most of the European countries had to suffer a severe economic crisis as the aftermath of the war, the United Kingdom had to abandon many of its colonial countries, a new political alliance had to form among nations.\n\nThis is, in my opinion, is the largest event in human history that shaped the world. The world today we see could have been different (politically and geographically) if the war would have produced a different result. No other event in history has affected the world as much as this war did."

    "Answer": "Japan has a distinct, fascinating culture, both modern and traditional, that is unlike any other countries, and will leave a lasting impression with any person. Some of the interesting aspects of Japanese culture may include their cuisines, architecture, performing arts, fashion, anime and mange/manga. But, today, I would like to talk about another cultural aspect of Japanese culture that I find interesting also.\n\nIt is called “Sakura viewing and Hanami parties”. In plain English, “Sakura” means cherry blossom. So, it essentially means the viewing of cherry blossom when they are in full bloom during the spring season. By the way, Sakura has remained an iconic symbol of Japanese culture and history for centuries, and when this Sakura viewing takes place, thousands of people, both local and visitors from around the world, flock to see the mesmerizing beauty of cherry flowers in full bloom.\n\nBy the way, this Sakura, which I first came to learn about from a travel show on TV and then, later on, after reading some travel journals, viewing may last only for a few days, but it may leave an impression on you for a lifetime.\n\nPeople from my culture also love flowers, and they even use them for many purposes and occasions, but gathering ceremonially at a place or at a particular time to watch the blossoming of the flower is something that they don’t normally do. Another difference between my culture and that of Japan, as far as viewing flowers is concerned, people from my culture prefer to bring flowers at home, if they like them, for decorating their homes while Japanese people like them better on trees.\n\nAnyway, I like this particular aspect of Japanese culture because it shows how much they really value the beauty in mother nature. Besides, since this particular culture brings people from all over the world for a common cause, that is to enjoy the stunning beauty of mother nature, it offers all of them a chance to understand and appreciate each other and thus bringing peace and harmony in a world, which is otherwise full of hatred and animosity."

    "Answer": "Different cultures and nations have their own custom, way of living and many distinctive characteristics that seem interesting and sometimes bizarre to others. Some of those cultural aspects are common across different countries and some of those cultures are unique to a particular nation or country. Finnish culture is a rich culture that has a long heritage and has gone different changes over time. One particular aspect I really love about their culture is how Finland celebrates a ‘Day for Failure’.\n\nI have first learned about this day from a friend of mine who completed his graduation from a Finish university. Later, I did some digging on Google and found out more about this fascinating aspect of Finish culture which is about how they value failure and inspire their people to do their best. In general, Finnish culture is composed of Finn, Swede, Sami, Roma, Tatar ethnic group and Finn is over 90% of the total population. Also, Finnish have an egalitarian society, which is reflected in their language that employs gender-neutral words. Moreover, Finnish people are very modest in behaviours and they give very importance on modesty and humbleness. So when they observe the day of failure, it must be something inspirational!\n\nThey celebrate failure on the 13th of October each year. The failure day is observed to allow people to open up about their problems and struggles in life and gather encouragement from society and others who have suffered similar fates but still managed to persevere. This is quite encouraging and something quite alien to our culture. We do not have such a culture to be so open about our failure and celebrate it nationwide by dedicating a day for this purpose!"

    "Answer": "Environmental problem is a very big issue in today’s world these days. In fact, there is hardly any country or city in this world which hasn’t had to deal with this problem in these modern times. So, naturally, the place, in which I live, is not immune from it either, even though, the environmental problem, my place is facing, can be little different from other places.\n\nAnyway, the environmental problem, that my area is facing today, is deforestation. But, I bet that the majority of the people, where I live, didn’t even know before 10 years that such a problem could actually exist. But, they came to a rude awakening when they found out to their utmost shock that more than 50 per cent of the trees, which once provided them shed and clean air on a hot summer day, had just vanished.\n\nOf course, the culprit to blame for such deforestation can squarely fall upon the urbanization efforts of our local city government, which is trying to construct more and more new buildings for commercial purposes. Some new buildings are also being erected in order to accommodate the rising population who are moving into our city for a better life and better employment opportunities. Then also, the trees on both sides of the roads, which were planted a long time ago as a part of “city beautification” effort, are also gone to make the roads even wider.  So, in essence, people like me feel that it is an all-out attack on our city eco system, which was saving it for a long time, in the name of some so-called urbanization and modernization.\n\nAnyway, in order to stop this environmental problem or deforestation, the local city government must take a comprehensive plan to plant more trees in a ring that surrounds our entire city. Besides, city dwellers should also be encouraged or even be given incentives to plant any kind of trees on whatever empty space they have in their front yard or back yard. Finally, people can also plant different kinds of trees on their roof tops to increase the number of living trees in their city."

    "Answer": "There are so many problems that negatively affect the environment in our area and among these, the density of population, in my opinion, is the most severe one. While in many countries, less than 100 people live in one square kilometre, we have got around a thousand people living in one square kilometre. Because of this high population and population density in city areas, lots of problems are arising.\n\nThe expenditure to support living is quite high compared to the average earning of the people, heavy traffic has become a common scenario in the roads and as a consequence, lots of time is killed every day. The lower economic people are not getting the proper education and hospital facility, crime has increased than ever, lots of unplanned and risky constructions have been established, the environment is getting polluted and seems like no one cares.\n\nThere are many reasons that caused this outburst of this mass population in our city and among those, the most influential reason is the centralisation of the industry in this city. Most of the factory, offices and organisations are located in this city and people from all area of the country are coming here to find a living. Unemployment in rural areas is another reason why people are trying to stay here. The political reason not to take strict decisions on making equal opportunity in the country is another reason. The businesses and job opportunity attract people to come and live here in this city.\n\nPeople can feel the heat of this uncontrolled population and the problems are creating for that but they have little control over it. We all suffer from the problems and talk about it but I have not seen any big movement to solve this problem. On the other hand, the political leaders who can take initiatives to lessen the problem are sometimes corrupted to take appropriate and honest steps.\n\nThere are lots of theories to solve this problem and seems like we all know about it. First of all, decentralisation should be done and industries and factories that can be moved to other areas should be moved promptly. Proper education and job sectors should be ensured so that people can earn their living in their cities rather than coming here. Local government can be formed to support and improve each area of the country. Each local government should be able to invest and decide on the development projects in their area.\n\nPeople naturally want to live in a better place where they can find the necessary infrastructure, daily needs and can earn a living. If that can be ensured throughout the country, this problem can be reduced."

    "Answer": "Carrying a knife has been a time-honoured tradition for men throughout history. The Romans' invention of the folding pocket knife was a significant technological innovation in its day, making a knife safer to carry and easier to conceal.  Even today, a knife remains an essential tool for everyday life.\n\nBut, I am certainly not going to talk about carrying a knife. But, rather, I want to talk about a knife – a pocket knife that is - that I use often at my home. By the way, I didn’t buy this knife on my own, but rather it was given to me by an Engineer cousin of mine.\n\nIt is about 6 inches long and has a metallic handle. I wouldn’t describe it as a heavy knife, but I wouldn’t call it lightweight either. In fact, I feel that the knife was made with a lot of consideration and plan behind it so that people could feel it and also use it easily. By the way, the blade of the knife is also curved with some unique but nice design so that at the first look, it doesn’t quite look like a real knife but just a souvenir for the purpose of home decoration home.  \n\nAnyway, this knife is an important tool since I can use it to do a lot of things. For example, I use it to cut tape, cut string, cut trailing threads on clothing, open boxes and packages, cut/strip wires, prepare food like fruits and vegetables, open mail/envelopes, open food packaging, cut paper in the absence of scissors, cut zip ties, and remove tags from new clothing. Sometimes, I use to unscrew nails also when I don’t have access to any screwdriver.\n\nAnyway, this knife is rather simple to work with. All one needs is to pull its blade from inside the hiding place of its handle before using it. One would also need to run its blade across an object, instead of actually pushing it against the object, in order to cut it properly. However, its blade also requires sharpening on a regular basis for the knife to work properly."

The tool I would like to talk about today is the vacuum cleaner that I use to clean the furniture’s, carpet and my house. I clean my house 1-2 times a week and mostly on days-off. Cleaning the whole house and the furniture is very time-consuming and difficult. The vacuum cleaner that I use makes it easy for me to clean, especially cleaning the dust on the carpet.\n\nThe machine or equipment is very handy and I find it important to keep our house neat & clean. Our house is just beside the main road and that makes it more prone to dust. Before purchasing the vacuum cleaner, it was very tiresome and tough to task for us to clean the house. But this has become easier after I started using this tool.\n\nThe vacuum cleaner is electronic equipment that requires the AC current. After plugging in I turn on the power switch and use the long handle that sucks all the dust. I place the front of the machine towards the dust and it gulps the dust and they are then placed in a dustbin. A Vacuum cleaner is an important tool for me as it does an important task of our home."

    "Answer": "Living in a country like Bangladesh, when thinking about a wild animal, the name of the mighty royal Bengal tiger unmistakably comes into my mind, simply because they are so different from any other wild animals. So, I will go ahead and describe this royal animal as best as I can.\n\nAnyway, although they are called the royal Bengal tiger (by the way, Bengal means “Bangladesh” in modern times), these wild animals are not unique to Bangladesh only because they also live in some parts of India, Nepal and Bhutan. But, as far as Bangladesh is concerned, our royal Bengal tigers live in the “Sundarban” which is widely viewed as the largest mangrove forest in the world.\n\nBeing the largest (in size) members of the cat family, this majestic animal’s coat or skin is yellow to light orange with stripes ranging from dark brown to black, and the belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white while its tail (about 60-110 centimetres long) is orange with black rings. Its head-body length is 140-280 cm while it has a height of about 95-110 centimetres at its shoulder. Their sizes can vary from up to 220 kg (for male) and 140 kg for female. Being renowned for their immense power and strength, these wild animals are not only about to hunt on land but also in the water since they know how to swim also. On top of that, they are also able to climb the trees and kill their prey by using their large and retractable claws. These fearless animals use their distinctive coats as camouflage to do the hunting, and they can travel miles to find buffalo, deer, wild pigs, and other large mammals.\n\nWell, I feel that these wild animals are some of the rare natural wonders of our animal world, and as such, they should be preserved at all cost before becoming completely extinct. In fact, while their number was in hundreds of thousands before a hundred year, today they have come down to probably 2500 altogether because of illegal hunting and destruction of their natural habitat."

    "Answer": "Tiger is a wild animal which is very common in our country. It is the largest animal of the cat species and they grow up quite large. It can grow up to 11 feet and can weigh more than 300 kg. Tigers generally live about 25 years and they require a large habitat area that supports their prey requirements.\n\nMost of the tigers of the world are found in the widely are across Asia, Turkey and Russia. The most recognisable feature of a tiger is its dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. They have got a big head and sharp teeth claws. It is a carnival animal that mostly depends on the meat of other animals. The largest number of tigers can be found in India and the total subspecies and the numbers of tigers are decreasing over time.  Tigers are good swimmers and are often found crossing rivers and lakes in heavy tides.\n\nTigers usually hunt alone unlike other animals that prey in a group. They target their prey first and then aim at it. When the target is fixed, it attacks with a sudden ferocity overpowering the prey with the strength and size. Tigers have a great leaping ability and can run very fast.\n\nThis formidable large wild animal is getting extinct over time and they have become numbered in the world. Approximately only 3500 tigers are present in the world and the number is decreasing. Many tigers are held in the zoo for public and they usually live on supplied meat.\n\nIn my opinion, since the human is superior to any other living species, we have a responsibility to prevent the extinction of the tiger as we are the primary reason for their extinction. Wild animals are part of the eco-system we live in and we have a natural responsibility to preserve a balanced eco-system for our own good."

But, they looked so impressive and unique that it became very difficult to choose one over the others as far as their looks and architectural designs were concerned. However, there was one building which looked way more impressive to me than other buildings, and I would like to provide some information on it here.\n\nIt was/is located in the capital city of my country which is popularly known as the largest shopping mall in South Asia. I am talking about “Jamuna Future Park”. This building is so huge, with a gross leasable area of 1,614,586 square feet, that even though the construction of this building started in 2002, it was actually completed in the year of 2013.  \n\nAnyway, I have seen it many times, and when I saw it for the first time about a few years ago, all I could see was a gigantic building, standing tall with its 7 floors. The building also had a tower-like entrance which was made of tower shape, beautiful looking glass. I am not a building expert, but when I entered inside the building, I saw that all kinds of best quality building materials like silicone, aluminium and expensive glass. In addition to that, I could also see that the surface of each floor of the building was glazing exquisitely with all kinds of beautiful looking tiles and marble stones. Finally, the lighting scheme inside that building was so beautiful and matched so perfectly with the decoration inside that I felt like I was actually spending my time in a \"dreamland\".\n\nThe building impressed me because it was a “mini modern city” by itself with its own power plant, indoor transportation facilities, facilities for live entertainment, theme park, gymnasium, swimming pool, health club, food court, world-class movie theatre and Wi-Fi internet system. Besides, the interior of the building was so spacious one could literally get lost in it while looking at its elegant interior and decoration. All in all, it was a building worth visiting."

    "Answer": "The Central Bank building is the one that really impressed me. I was then almost 17 years old when I first this building and I still remember that I became amazed watching and wondering about it.\n\n10-15 stories building are quite common in our town but the 75 storied central bank building is really different. Not only it is higher than most other buildings but it also possesses an eye-catchy architectural design which is bound to absorb any one's attention. From far it will only give you the impression of a futuristic mega structure but if you observe the building from nearby, you will see the real beauty of it.\n\nIt looks like every inch of it has been drawn before building it. This building is a fine piece of architecture that prominently announces its presence. When I looked at the top of this building I got the impression that it is endless and has made its way over the sky. The long round clock in from of this building ticks twice to let the city dwellers know its presence.\n\nThis central bank building is situated near the National Museum of the city. From a far away, it looks like a pathway to the sky and from nearby it seems like a massive yet beautifully designed architectural building."

    "Answer": "The Great Wall of China is one of the most interesting buildings and man-made constructions in history. When I first visited this structure, I was quite taken aback by the massive length and intricate design of this edifice. I saw this building several times on TV but viewing it in person was a totally different experience for me. In my opinion, this is the most interesting buildings/constructions that I have ever seen.  \n\nThe Great Wall of China is one of the seven wonders of the world and indeed a magnificent construction that reminds us of the history of the past. It is more than 21 kilometres in size and is a series of fortifications made of brick, tamped earth, stone, wood, and other materials. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century and the majority of the existing walls were constructed during the Ming Dynasty. Protecting the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe and to watch the enemy movements were the main reason this Great Wall was constructed. Soldiers used to keep walking on the Great Wall and could easily warn others about approaching enemies. This vast wall runs across China like a large dragon and stands like the protector of the country. Soldiers used to walk on this wall and kept eyes on enemy activities and fires were lit if any suspicious activity was observed to warn other soldiers.  \n\nThere is a common misconception that this is the only man-made construction that can be seen from the moon. Though this is an exaggerated statement, however, it clearly states the sheer size of this construction. Thousands of tourists each year come to visit this wonderful construction and this has become one of the most significant tourist attractions in China. In a way, the Great Wall has become a symbol of China's pride and a prominent example of its past glory and strength."

    "Answer": "If I remember correctly, in my early days as a child, I wasn’t exactly that much interested in playing with toys. Rather, I was interested more in running outside of the home or jumping with other kids. In fact, I would enjoy outdoors more than staying at home. But, my parents thought that I would rather spend more time at home, hence the idea of buying many toys for me.\n\nAnyway, a special toy that my parents bought for me was a toy car, made of quality plastic, and it was battery-operated. However, when the toy car was initially handed to me, I didn’t really find much use of it nor was I that much interested to learn about how it worked. In fact, if I remember it correctly, I left that toy alone for the first few days.\n\nBy the way, when I was a young child, I seldom remember my parents ever pushing me to do something or imposing anything on me. But, when they found that I wasn’t playing with my toy, they started to show me how to play with it. They even taught me some tricks about getting the car to make some funny sounds. And, it was at that I felt little interested in that plastic toy car. In fact, I really liked the funny sounds it was making. After that, I started to play with. And it was a multicoloured car, and it was about 6 inch in length. The toy had a little windshield and a driver seat also.  It was a fast toy, and the longer I was playing with that car, the more I liked it.\n\nAnyway, it was a special toy for me because I felt like it gave me the speed inside me that I was looking for. Besides, it was a very strong toy also because even though, I played very rough with it, it didn’t stop working or running. Finally, I consider the toy to be special also because it offered me an opportunity to spend some more quality time with my parents, which I cherish each and every day of my life."

    "Answer": "I remember having many toys in my childhood and in different stages of my childhood I preferred different toys. But among them, the digital artboard was a very special one to me and I played with this special toy for more than 3-4 years as I recall.\n\nThis was a gift from my father on the occasion of my 5th or 6th birthday. It looked like a whiteboard which was approximately 14x10 inch in dimension. The screen was white and there were 5-6 buttons to operate the digital artboard. A digital pen or stylus type pen was attached to it for painting. This stylus could be placed on the right side of the board. The board was similar to a middle size notebook and was lightweight.  \n\nI had a fascination with the toy when I first saw it at a superstore. I asked the salesman what the price was and how this can be used. He described that I can draw pictures on this board, edit them, save them and reopen the saved pictures anytime I like. There was a built-in memory and the user can store up to 10 thousand drawings. The colour and pen tool makes the painting easy. He also told that there are some premade design and template that would help the user to draw a picture. He then added 'though this would cost a bit high, it is the digital version of the painting brush, canvas and colours'. At that time I was around 5-6 years old and the toy really mesmerised me. I had a hidden desire to own it one day. I dreamed of art and save so many arts and painting and save them for long. Since I had a passion for painting, I thought the toy would be a perfect one for me. I told my father about my fascination with this toy and a few days later he gave this toy as my birthday gift. I was so happy to have it.\n\nThis toy was important to me because I have longed for it and that was a special gift from my father. I remember playing with it till I was 10-11 years old and I have painted lots of things on it. As a kid that was a fascinating and exciting toy for me."

    "Answer": "Since my early childhood, I have loved playing football. So, it was quite natural for me to always admire a great footballer. But, never had I had the urge to meet a famous footballer until I saw a magician with football called “Lionel Messi”.\n\nYes, I would like to meet Lionel Messi. Not sure about others, but I consider him as one of the legendary footballers of modern times, if not of all times. Lionel Messi is an Argentine Footballer who started his football career at the age of 17 when he joined Barcelona club. Since then, he never really had the time to look back as he kept winning for his club and team season after season with his extraordinary football skills. His style of play, as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler, drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, another football legend of all times, who described Messi as his successor. Anyway, in today’s world, there are a few very few football fans, who don’t know about Messi and his football skills, but many don’t know that he had to overcome some serious health issue, like hormone problem which made him grow way faster than other children of his age, in order to become one of the most successful footballers of modern times as well as the leading goal scorer of all times for his country, Argentina.\n\nOf course, Messi is a famous hero, not only because of his perseverance to overcome his physical deficiency and build his soccer skills but also for using it to spread joy around the world to many children who have a hard life.\n\nIf I ever get a chance to meet this famous footballer, I would certainly ask for some autographs from him first. Then, of course, I would ask him as to what really motivated him to become such a great footballer apart from the reason of being born in a football-crazy country. Besides, I would also invite him to come to visit my country sometime and play there. Then, finally, I would wish him \"best of luck\" for his better future career."

    "Answer": "In my to-meet list, there are so many famous persons whom I dream to meet and spend some time with. There are several scientists, actors, actress, political leaders, poets, IT specialists, business founders, sportsperson, writers and journalists in this list but Paulo Coelho is the person whom I would like to meet first.  \n\nHe is a famous Brazilian lyricist and novelist who has become one of the most widely read authors in the world. I am a great fan of his writing, enjoyed and deeply touched by most of his writing and that's why I want to meet him in person to talk about those stories and to know about the person who actually has got a brilliant way of storytelling.\n\nI read the book 'Alchemist' by him more than once and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is an inspiring and thought-provoking book and the writer has been able to tell the story in a fascinating way. This book has been translated into 67 different languages and has got numerous positive and critically acclaimed reviews. I know very little about the man behind these amazing stories and that's why I want to meet him - to know more about him. I place him in a highly esteemed position. I have enjoyed his many books including 'The Alchemist', 'The Valkyries', 'Eleven Minutes', 'The Zahir’ so much that I wanted to meet the person who wrote those truly amazing stories.\n\nWriters are dream-catchers and possess a magical power of blending the truth and imagination to create a story. Storytelling and giving them lives is a very difficult task. Paulo Coelho is a gifted writer who can easily absorb readers' attention to his powerful stories. His books are page-turners and would always make the reader desire to read more. I have been so mesmerised by his story that I would like to meet the real person who tells us the stories. I'd like to know his thoughts and opinions on many things and would like to spend some time with one of my favourite writers."

    "Answer": "I am always on the lookout for the interesting news story on TV except, of course, they don’t become available to be broadcast on our TV every hour or every day. But, about a few months ago, I just got lucky one day and found out that ABC (Australia) news channel was broadcasting a piece of weird but interesting news.\n\nAnyway, the news story was about a person in some part of India who could survive weeks just by eating grass. Initially, I couldn’t quite believe the news, thinking that the news presenter was probably asking us to think about a hypothetical situation where one would need to survive weeks by eating only grass. But, as the news presenter started to show the activities of a person in a small Indian village, who was chewing grass and swallowing them, I stopped doubting about the authenticity of that news.\n\nThe news also presented the interview of the strange Indian man where he was seen to be answering different kinds of questions. For example, he was asked about why and when he decided to start eating grass. The questions like how it really tasted to eat grass, and what his family members really think about his grass-eating habit were also asked. Anyway, the news (more like a mini-documentary) about that person had continued for about 10 minutes where the details about the person’s life, his family, his professions and his other activities were also discussed, apparently in an effort to prove that he was just another regular person, not some superhuman, like any other person except that he just had an incredible ability to survive by eating only grass for weeks.\n\nAll in all, it was interesting news because it successfully managed to put together the extraordinary habit of a rather ordinary person from another part of the world. Besides, it also went to a great length in presenting the facts on the ground in order to prove that if people really want to do something or learn something unique, they can do so with their courage and determination."

    "Answer": "Though I do not watch TV that much nowadays, but I often watch the news, documentary and sometimes talk-shows. Many of them are contemporary world news, some of them are political news and some of them are news stories. One such interesting news was a story that covered a case file of police who caught a serial killer. This news story was broadcasted in Fox news and I watched it about one year ago.\n\nThe news channel represented the news like a documentary and used some actors & actress and they acted to show the real story. The news story was that the police found some connections among some random murders. They worked hard and suspected that one single person or a group of 2-3 persons were responsible for the murders. They worked for several months to find the killer but each time ended with an unsolved mystery. After 5 years the file was reopened by a special team of police and they started reinvestigating the case. With their endless efforts, elaborate testing, extensive experiments and strong determination they finally started finding connections among the murders. They talked with different people of the places where the murders were committed; they went through every detail of the previous files and talked elaborately with the police officers who were engaged in the case for the first time. With 8 months' effort, they finally caught the murderer who to my surprise was a housewife of a happy family and the mother of 3 kids. She accepted the fact that she had committed the crime and that was revenge to the people who abused her during her career as a rising model of a suburban area.\n\nI watched the whole news story with great interest. The news story by itself was adventurous and interesting. Moreover, the news channel represented it like a movie presentation which made it more interesting and watch-worthy."

    "Answer": "When I was growing up as a young boy, especially in my high school, I was more like a below-average student. On top of that, I was also not as energetic as the other boys of my age. So, it is fair to assume that I wasn’t really enjoying going to school as much as I should have. But, then came a teacher in my life who I would never forget. His name was Mr Mukit Kumar. Mr Kumar, teaching Geography, wasn’t like other teachers of my high school because he seemed more friendly with his students than his colleagues.\n\nAnyway, I still vividly remember the first day when he asked the names of each and every student of his class. Then, he asked all of his students one by one to tell a positive thing about themselves. But, when it was my turn to answer that awkward question, I simply put my head down and kept quiet because I just didn’t know what to say. I guess, he understood my situation, so he told the whole class in my defence that I had a lot of positive things to tell about me, but I just didn’t know where to start. After saying that, Mr Kumar looked at me with a smiling face as if to tell me that I was just fine. And, that was when I felt for the first time that I could be just as good as other students.\n\nAnyway, Mr Kumar has influenced my academic life immensely with his very easy and laidback approach to teaching. Besides, he always used to remind his students, but especially me, not to think in the terms what we couldn’t do, but what we could do, even if it was a very little thing. Finally, it was because of his continuous encouragement to act and feel strong, no matter how physically weak I really was, that I developed very high self-esteem in me. And, needless to say, it was that high self-esteem in me that helped me excelled academically at a later time."

    "Answer": "I have met and liked several teachers in different years of my academic life. Among them Mr. (...say the name of the teacher...). He used to teach us history in our higher secondary level.\n\nThe first attractive quality he had is his well-manner and eloquence. He was a great teacher and we all liked his style of teaching. We were very surprised to know that he knew a lot about history and when he taught us, he told lots of relevant stories which made the classes more interesting. He did not believe in homework so he always gave tasks which we had to finish before our classes end. Because of him, we did well in the board exam in History. Besides his great way of teaching, he taught us morality, the importance of education and how to value \"morality\" and \"time\".\n\nHe influenced us to read books and history books outside our syllabus which turned out to be very useful later in our lives. He inspired us to read English newspapers, journals, watch history-related channels, technology and history related magazines. He was talented and very friendly to the students. He never turned down anyone whenever someone asked for his help and advice. He had an athletic body and we found him often participate in different outdoor games. He inspired us to do physical exercises and outdoor games.\n\nIn short, he was an exemplary person and an ideal teacher whom most of the students liked and respected very much. I have been greatly influenced by his punctuality, honesty, talent and good behaviour. I still remember him and the advice he gave me."

    "Answer": "There are so many things in life to do and see except, of course, the problem is that we just don’t have “unlimited” time in our hands. However, as far as I am concerned, I think that I have already figured out what I really want to do in the future.\n\n“Traveling”, and only more and more travelling is what I want to do in the future in the next 20 years or so before I completely retire from the professional world except, of course, the problem is we can’t really move even an inch in these days and eras without money. So, the plan, for now, is to work as hard as possible and save up as much money as possible also at the same time. Of course, the good thing is I have already decided what I really want to take as my profession, which is to start a small business, as I have never really felt good about having “9 am to 5 pm” kind of job for the rest of my life. Besides, owning a business firm allows a person to take a certain level of calculated risk and liberty to earn money in a legal way which may not always be possible if we have a “regular” job. So, anyway, having my own business is what I want to do, not only to earn a living but also learning/reading about different countries, so that I know exactly which places are good for travelling.\n\nI want to travel around the world mainly because I have long, from my childhood, been fascinated by different cultures, traditions, religions and lifestyles, and there is no better way, in my humble opinion, to learn about them without travelling extensively. Besides, travelling to different places has always made me feel relaxed and recuperate from the monotonous life of our daily hectic work schedule. Finally, travelling just might also allow me to explore into the possibilities of even further business opportunities so that I can actually earn more money while doing the travelling also at the same time."

The money I will inherit and the amount I am currently saving per month should allow me to start a business. I have planned to start a big shopping mall. I will have my close relatives as the employees and authorities of the business and initially, I will work in this shopping mall for 2-3 years to make it run smoothly. When the business would go on with its own path, I will enjoy my vacation and would visit different renowned and beautiful cities of the world. I will visit Asia, Europe, Russia and many more places.\n\nHopefully, I will enjoy retirement and trips. Though I am not sure about the future, I have already planned for it.

But, today, I would like to talk about an email, that I received about a few years ago, which I consider to be really important.\n\nSince the early days of email and the internet, I have liked to become a member of different significant email groups. The purpose of creating such email groups was to let every one of us know through emails, if anybody, from the groups or beyond, needed any help. One such email group, which I belonged to, was “blood donation” group, and the email, I received about a couple of years ago, was from the admin of this group. The email talked about a seriously ill person, who needed a huge amount of blood of certain blood group, but unfortunately, nobody was willing to become a blood donor. Anyway, even though, I got to see the email a bit late, but as soon as I read the email, I got into action and immediately asked for help from one of my friends in my home town, who luckily had the same blood group. After learning about the positive news, I emailed back to the admin of the group about my friend and his willingness to help the seriously ill patient.\n\nThe email was important to me obviously because it allowed me to save the life of a seriously ill person when nobody could be found to help him. Besides, the email made me realize the importance of each and every person around us, and thus maintaining a minimum level of social relationship with them, as they all could be potential lifesavers. Finally, the email also made me realize the fact once again that the world truly has become smaller, because of the technological advancement, and that we should never underestimate the role of such technologies in saving lives, no matter where we live or when we need the help."

When I was a student of 6th semester of the university, I needed to manage a part-time job. I applied for several jobs but my dream job was to work as a consultant for a major telecom company in my country. It was not easy to get the job since many candidates applied for the job and the company prefers full-time employees than the part-time employees.\n\nOne day I got an email from Mr. Atherton (...say a name common in your country...) and I found that it was from the telecom company where I was interviewed. It was early November 2001 and that time I was around 22 years old. I opened the email went to the details of the email very quickly. My heart was pounding and I felt really good when I found that the email confirms my appointment as a part-time employee for this company. I re-read the email and took a print out as well. The email was sent to me by the Head of the Human Resource department of the company.\n\nIt was a very important email for me as I was desperately expecting to work for this company and the email confirmed my joining there.

While some of those messages make us feel happy, the others sadden and demoralize us. Today, I would like to talk about one such important message, which I received about 5 years ago, that made me truly happy.\n\nAgain, it was about 5 years ago, and I had just finished my four years honours course in Management Information System from the university. So, naturally, the next course of action for me was to get enrolled at the university again and finish my post-graduation degree. But, the problem was that the results in my undergraduate degree were not good enough to seek further education as a post-graduate student at the same university except, of course, I had at least a couple of years of previous work experience at a pharmaceutical company. So, the only option left for me was to “pray” in order to get listed on the ‘waiting list’, for students like me to receive admission offers from the authority at a later time, should somebody change the “Management Information System” major and transfer to another faculty or department. So, anyway, my waiting period started, and all I could do was to pray for a call from my university authority. Luckily enough, I did receive a formal message in an email, a couple of weeks after the initial trouble, inviting me to get enrolled at my university to carry on my Master's degree in Management Information System.\n\nThe message was certainly important for me as it pretty much decided the course of my life and career for many years to come, by helping me become the person I am today, as I could not possibly excel academically as much in other educational fields as in the subject of my choice. Besides, it helped me stay in my home town and carry on with my higher education by remaining close to my elderly parents, which was absolutely important for me and my family."

But then, I do watch advertisements, especially if it delivers a good message or make us laugh, from time to time because they are unique and creative. Today, I would like to talk about one such “creative” ad that I watched about a few years ago.\n\nThe advert initially showed a guy, probably in his early 30’s, walking past a building, built with glass. Then the guy suddenly looks at the glass and finds a “baby” (a 2 years old baby that is) version of him. Then, obviously, the guy gets “amused” by looking at the little “baby” in him on the glass and starts making different kinds of dance moves. A few other people, who were passing by at the same time, saw this rather “unusual” incident and came forward to check what was really going on, but they also found the same “baby” versions, both boys and girls, of them, in the glass who were dancing happily, nonstop. The dancing kept on going for about 30 seconds or so and, at the end of the advertisement’s stipulated running time, came the moving image of a certain kind of “bottled water” (Evian water) on the TV screen, apparently in an effort to convince people to drink the bottled water for the purpose of getting “refreshed” after a certain workout and remain “young” for that matter.  \n\nAnyway, I found the advertising really interesting primarily because it had a great concept, both “catchy” and “creative” at the same time, which used the suspense by allowing what was being advertised to be what comes last, a bottled water product that is, in order to target its audience with a “precise” message. Besides, the advertisement very cleverly showed that each and every person has a “child” in him or her no matter how old he/she becomes.

Thus he became a successful journalist and finally won an international prize for his honesty and bravery in his profession. His parents, mentors, teachers, friends and others were highlighted at the end of the advertisement and as a flashback, the Cello pen was shown. The advertisement revealed that the pen has contributed from the beginning to the end of his success and was never congratulated. Yet this is a silent partner of the man’s success.\n\nIt was a commercial advert of a company who manufactures and sells pens.

But, of course, my father didn’t think that it was a good idea to buy a gift and mail it to him and decided instead to send a “money order” from a bank nearby.\n\nSo I visited a local branch of Standard Chartered bank. But, after entering the bank, I found a long queue waiting to “welcome” me instead of some “friendly” faces! So, I had no other choice except waiting there until my turn came. However, after waiting for about 20 minutes, while occasionally chatting with an officer, I finally managed to make a “money order”.\n\nAnyway, talking about my experience, I wouldn’t exactly say it was very “thrilling” because every customer there seemed to be a bit “agitated” as it was taking a bit way too long to finally reach the bank official. Besides, the behaviour of the bank officials wasn’t very “inviting” either because they weren’t probably expecting that kind of rush at that hour. However, the good thing about that visit was, I actually managed to befriend with one of the officers there because we attended the same high school!"

    "Answer": "I have visited several banks for different purposes and for this cue card I would like to talk about my visit to the City Bank. I visited this bank for the first time in 2008 when I was a new student at my university. After I finished my first semester, I had to go to this bank to pay my 2nd semester's fee as this bank was the affiliated bank for our university.\n\nIn the early morning, I went to the bank and found that some of the students were already standing in the queue. I asked the helpdesk officer what I should do to pay my semester fee. He handed over me 2 forms and asked me to fill these forms first and then stay in the line to pay the amount. I filled the forms and then stood in the line. After 20 minutes or so when I was at the front of the line, the cash officer asked me to give the form and then the amount mentioned on it. He took the forms and counted the money both in hands and a cash machine. He then asked me to sign in a part of the form that I overlooked and missed. I signed in it and waited for 2 minutes when he gave me a receipt. I left the line and sat on a sofa for a few minutes as I was waiting for one of my classmates. After he finished paying his fee, we two left the bank.\n\nMy overall experience of the bank was very good as the bank had a really impressive environment, the staffs were cordial and helpful and my objective to pay the fee was done very quickly."

    "Answer": "Not sure about others, but it was a blessing for me to have an opportunity to attend a great primary school, while growing up as a young boy, where I learned a number of important life lessons. Today, I would like to talk about one such an important lesson.\n\nThe lesson, I learned, was that we should all remain true to ourselves always. Of course, I already knew that telling the truth to others was very important, but I wasn’t familiar with the idea of being true to myself until I reached 5th grade. In fact, I learned about this important lesson in a rather hard way when I failed to finish my own science project on time.\n\nAnyway, the science project, I chose, was a rather difficult one. However, before assigning the project, my science teacher had repeatedly asked me if I was able to finish it on time as it was a difficult one. But, I pretended that I was fully capable of pulling off any project, no matter how difficult it was, even though I knew that the project would pose a major challenge to me.  \n\nI still accepted that project only because I didn’t want to show my weaknesses to others. Besides, I also wanted to create some “wow” factor among my classmates. But, as the time for submitting the project was approaching, I was becoming nervous because I wasn’t going anywhere close to finishing my project. So, I asked for some additional time from my teacher, and he agreed. But, I still couldn’t finish the project on time, leaving me embarrassed in front of my other classmates. And, at that time, I realized that I should have been true to myself, having some clear idea about my own ability and skills.\n\nAnyway, the lesson, I learned in my primary school, had always forced me since to analyse any situation thoroughly by taking time before making any decision whether they were big or small. Besides, this particular lesson also had taught me to be humble in front of others even if I had enough reasons to boast."

    "Answer": "Primary school is our first academic educational place and we start learning many new things from there. This is the place where the base of a student is made and that’s why things we learn in our primary school last for a long. One important lesson that I learned from my primary school is the value of time. In every stage of our life, we have to value the time we have and this lesson has helped me throughout my life. \n\nI learned it throughout the 4-5 years I studied in primary school. I was only 5 years old when I first got admitted into primary school and had been there till I became 10 years old. I have heard it from many teachers of my primary school. They told lots of stories and gave examples from history and real events about the value of time. From my experience, I have also learned and understood it.\n\nIf fact our lives are nothing but a sum of time. We come here for a predefined amount of time and we have so many things to accomplish and do to make our lives meaningful. We have our duties and responsibilities and those duties and responsibilities changes and expands with time. So being able to do things in their perfect time is the main mantra of life.\n\nFrom my experience, I have learned that time is priceless and we can never get it back once gone. So utilising it is the most important task in our life. Everything has its perfect time to be done and no matter what we do and how much effort we put, later on, we can’t change the actions we take with times. I have learned that, if I neglect the time and keep undone things that I should have done, it comes back to us like a boomerang. Accomplishing thing in time and doing them with dedication is the first rule to achieve success. Whenever I have values time and worked accordingly, I had been able to fulfil my aim and expectation. When I neglected time and kept things undone, I regretted it. From those experiences, I have started valuing time and that has brought me several successes that I desired. I still try to value my times and thus I can save myself from regretting later."

    "Answer": "I am one of those people who just can’t seem to understand the virtue of saving money, probably because we get more fun in spending them rather than saving them. Besides, I guess that it is my natural instinct to spend as much as I can.  However, it may sound a bit odd, but even I saved up some money against my natural instinct because I wanted to buy something special.\n\nThe money, I saved, was to buy a pure leather jacket. Of course, one may ask as to why I was really so broke financially that I actually needed to save up some money to buy some kind of jacket? I mean, was I really not earning enough to even pay about a couple of hundred dollars to buy a leather jacket?! Well, the answer is, yes, I was earning enough, probably more than enough, to pay for a jacket without using any saved up money, but I still needed to save up the money because I had spent a lot of money in buying an expensive motorbike only a few weeks earlier.\n\nSo, I was essentially “broke” when I wanted to buy a leather jacket which was made of pure and expensive leather. By the way, I wanted to buy a leather jacket because I was essentially getting tired of wearing a winter coat, made of fabrics, which needed regular cleaning. Besides, a winter coat, which is made of fabrics, gets easily worn out, and as such, I needed something more versatile and all-purpose coat. Anyway, it didn’t take me long to save enough money to buy my favourite jacket because I managed to buy it only after a month or so after buying my motorbike.   \n\nAnyway, it was important for me to buy that jacket because it was really becoming cold during the winter where I lived in my country. Besides, I also needed to buy it because I would be able to use it for any occasion or in any place during the wintertime without worrying that my winter court would become worn out and old quickly."

    "Answer": "To purchase a digital camera for my younger sister I had to save money for about 6 months. It was a Canon SLR camera that I knew she had a great desire to purchase. Since she is still in her college, it was really difficult for her to buy such a camera.\n\nAfter I joined in a part time job, I planned to buy it for her. I wanted her to be happy with the camera and that’s the primary reasons I wanted to purchase it. I knew she has a talent in photography and that’s why I wanted her to have a good camera so that she gets inspired. After I went to some branded camera shops, I found that the camera would cost me a bit more that I would be able to effort. As I have joined a part time job at that time, it was not easy for me to instantly purchase the camera for my sister. Then I planned to save money for few months and then purchase it. I had to save money for 6-7 months and then I had been able to actually buy it.\n\nGiving present or surprise gift to someone we care is more exciting and blissful than purchasing for ourselves. As her elder brother, I wanted to give her the camera so that she becomes happy. I also wanted her to continue her hobby of photography which was quite tough without a good quality camera. For these reasons, it was very important for me to purchase her the camera."

    "Answer": "I have seldom bought anything in my life which I didn’t use until they were old and worn out. In fact, many times, I have even tried to upgrade or fix some of the things, which are old or worn out, for further use. But, unfortunately, that was not the case when I bought a very modern exercising machine.\n\nI am talking about the “treadmill” machine, which I bought from a local health and fitness stores in my hometown about a few years ago. As per the salesperson at that store, the treadmill was built by one of the best companies in the world, and every part of it was perfectly in sync with the rest of its body. It also was a standard home treadmill, about 7 feet long and 3 feet wide in size, and its frames were made out of heavy-duty steel.\n\nAll in all, it was a perfect looking treadmill for anybody who wanted to get his or her body in shape.  So, I also bought that treadmill machine because I wanted to get in shape without running outside in some unfavourable weather conditions, associated with uncomfortable heat, humidity or cold. Anyway, after buying the exercising machine, I exercised on it for the first 6 months like there was no tomorrow, whenever I got a chance. In fact, I was so enthusiastic about getting in shape with the help of my newly-bought fitness machine that I even used to wake up in the middle of the night sometimes in order to sweat a little. However, after that, my enthusiasm for exercise died down slowly and eventually stopped using my treadmill that much.  \n\nAnyway, even though I liked my treadmill machine, I couldn’t use it that much because I got a little busier with my work life and other priorities. Besides, I also felt that it was important for me to go outside and enjoy some outdoor activities also sometimes in order to enjoy some fresh air and mother nature, instead of just staying at home and using the fitness machine, if I really wanted to remain healthy."

    "Answer": "I love to have technological devices and gadgets, and sometimes, I purchase them from the attraction rather than necessity. One such device I bought that I have rarely used was the Sony gaming console. I purchased it in 2011 with a good amount of money but have not played games in it more than 10 times! \n\nI bought it from a big Sony showroom from a nearby market. The time I bought it, I had the passion of purchasing it and I did not think about the amount it would cost and how many times I would actually use it. It was like fulfilling a wish rather than purchasing a utilitarian device for daily use. \n \nWhen I bought it, I was fascinated to buy it. In fact, I had a long desire to buy it and after I bought it, I got busy with my study and the new job. I noticed that over time, my fascination of playing games in a gaming device or in a computer has decreased. Moreover, my job, my university and my other interests require the majority time and hence I got very little time for playing the game. With time this device has become a backdated gaming console and I have lost interest in it. And because of that, I did not use it that much."

    "Answer": "I think that exchanging greeting cards is a great way to show our love and appreciation to our loved ones. Of course, I haven’t really received that many greeting cards in my life, which I would consider special, except the one which I had received from my little sister about 5 years ago.\n\nI had just graduated from my university back then, after spending a long 5 years of study, at the expense of my parent’s money. However, none of my family members, including my parents, elder brothers and uncles, was very happy with me because my graduation results were not that great. So, it was a frustrating situation for me because most of my family members, except my little sister, thought that I had failed them with my poor university grades.\n\nThe situation became even more frustrating when I wasn’t receiving any good job offers. Of course, I kept trying even harder by learning about all the interview tricks to impress the interviewing managers, but the result was the same as I was still not getting any good job offers.  But, my little angel sister, who was only about 12 years old back then, kept encouraging me by assuring me that I had all the qualifications, skills and aptitudes to get a good job. And, she was proved out to be right because I got a good job soon after her reassurance after trying for almost a year. But, the best thing was yet to come from my sister as she gave me a very ordinary greeting card with a very extra-ordinary message that said: “I have always believed in your abilities and I will keep doing so as long as I am your sister”.\n\nAnyway, I think, it was one of the most special messages, if not the most special one, I have ever received from anyone because it came to me at a time when I was very depressed and frustrated about my life and future. In fact, that little message from my little sister taught me that we should never give up our hope for what we want to achieve."

On my 22nd birthday, my grandfather gave a precious gift and a birthday greeting card that I still have. Sadly my grandpa left the world after a few months of my 22nd birthday and this greeting card is the last memory I have regarding my grandfather. \n\nMY grandfather wrote a personal message on the greeting card and signed it. The message read “To my dearest grandson on his happy birthday. Live your full life with happiness and joy”. He wrote it inside the card and the handwriting was so excellent and lively that I still find it very hard to believe that he is no longer with us. \n\nThis card is a special one to me as it was a precious gift that I got from my loving grandfather who is no longer with us. Whenever I look at this card and the message he wrote, I remember him and his happy and content face. This is why it is still a valuable possession I have."

    "Answer": "Many true stories are popular among the people in my country, but not all of them arouse the same kind of passion or interests among them as the story of the prince of “Bhawal” who was presumed to be dead a decade earlier, only to be found alive again a decade later. The story goes like this:\n\nHis name was Ramendra Narayan Roy was one of the Kumars (or a \"prince\") of the Bhawal Estate, a large zamindari (an aristocratic landowner) in Bengal in modern-day Bangladesh.  He was one of three brothers who had inherited the estate from their father. He was popularly known to people as \"mejokumar\" (the second prince of the three princes). Long story short, Ramendra Narayan Roy was reported to have died on 7 May at the age of 25. The reported cause of death was biliary colic (gallstones). His body was supposedly cremated in Darjeeling (West Bengal, India) the next day in a customary funerary rite. And, that should have been the end of the story.\n\nBut, it wasn’t, and that’s exactly why it became so popular in the subsequent years. In fact, the “dead prince”, was found to be alive in April of the year of 1921.  Later on, it also became apparent that the prince was actually poisoned by his own family members. But, he was eventually found and saved by a “saint” who nursed him back to life. He recovered, but suffered a memory loss and wandered India for the next 10 years before returning home to Dhaka in 1920, where he recovered his memory back again. By the way, I heard this story for the first time from my grandfather about 25 years ago.\n\nAnyway, I think that the popularity of this story lies in the fact that people always have some kind of soft corner for tragedies, involving innocent people like Prince Ramendra Narayan Roy, who became the victim of power politics and conspiracy. But, somehow, the truth always comes out sooner or later just as it did in the case of this poor prince."

    "Answer": "There are many true stories that people in my country know and talk about often. One such story is the success story of Mr Arther who is a living legend and is one of the top ten richest businessmen in the country. This story is about his determination, struggle, fight against adversity and finally the unmatched success he achieved.\n\nThe story starts with a 15 years old teenager who came to the capital city virtually with no capital and no one to turn to and started working as a very ignorable hawker. But the dream he had, the determination he had, and the patience he showed was limitless. He had to face severe adversities and yet he never lost his faith and determination. With hard work and determination, he continued his journey. He proved the fact that the fortune favours the brave. He had never in his early life stopped from fulfilling his dream and continued his journey. Over time he has been rewarded with some success and he became a moderate business owner. He did not stop there. He continued to work even harder and envisioned a better dream. Thus he started piling up the success and from a moderate businessman, he became one of the enviable businessmen in the country. Now his one of the top ten richest and successful persons in the country and all his fortunes were hard-earned.\n\nThis story is a popular story in our country and people often refer to this story to give an example of a successful man who has fought hard to achieve it. We often mention this story to inspire people and to advise them on how to be determined and hardworking to achieve their dreams.\n\nI first heard this story in my childhood from one of my school teachers and in my college level, I read an article in a magazine regarding the hard work, struggle and success Mr Arther got.\n\nI think this is a very inspiring story that advises us to have our dreams and to work hard to achieve those dreams. If your determination is hard, plannings are proper and if you work accordingly to achieve it, no matter how many obstacles come, you would overcome it and this is the lesson this true story teaches me."

    "Answer": "It takes some special characters and the courage to learn about animals and be around them. Of course, while I never claim to have such special characters or courage, I find a few animals interesting enough to talk about, and elephant happens to be just one of them.\n\nI am pretty sure that I don’t really need to introduce elephant anew as we all happen to know that it is the second-largest mammals in the world, right after the blue whale. Depending on which part of the world an animal comes from, their weights can vary from anywhere between 2700 kg to 6000 kg. They can also be of varied length and height. For example, the Length of an Asian elephant can be anywhere between 5.5 – 6.5 m while the height of an African bush elephant can be 3.2 m (meters).\n\nBy the way, I have learned a great deal about this animal by visiting a local animal zoo in my town when the authority has kept varieties of elephants from different parts of the world. However, while zoos are a great place to learn and get ideas about how the elephants really look or behave, they are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are also found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. And as far as the diets of elephants are concerned, they eat between 149 and 169 kg of vegetation daily while consuming grasses, small plants, bushes, fruit, twigs, tree bark, and roots.  However, a large number of these large mammals is being killed today all over the world for their ivory.\n \nAnyway, I find elephants very interesting because even though they are such strong animals, they can be just as emotional as humans. In fact, elephants are found to be crying when they are hurt or lose their baby calves. In fact, many research shows that elephants are very intelligent and social animals which are drawn to human rather easily. Besides, elephants are also known to have reconciled with each other after conflicts among them."

    "Answer": "The elephant is the largest land animal and in my opinion, is a very interesting animal. In my childhood, I saw some of the elephants that their owners brought to show to the public and later on, I learned about this animal from different TV programmes and the Internet. \n\nThe elephants are found in many countries in Asia and Africa including Thailand, Some parts of Australia, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. They are wild animals and are found in forests and hill areas. There are many interesting facts about this animal and some of them are really unique. First of all this animal is the largest species alive who live in the land area. They are bigger in size and a baby elephant is usually 3 feet tall and weight almost 200 pounds or over 90 kg.  The largest elephant on record was more than 13 feet and was more than 10,000 kg which is significantly higher than any other land-living animal.  \n \nSecondly, they are a very aborigines animal and there is evidence that there were 6-7 elephant species during the Ice Age in North America and Eurasia. The wrinkled skins of elephants help them regulate the temperature and humidity. It helps them retain 5-10 times more water than a smoothly skinned animal. This wrinkled skin also helps them cool down their body temperature by losing more heat. Another interesting fact about the elephant is that the herd of the elephants is usually led by a female elephant. Interestingly the tie of the elephant herd is so strong that they mourn when a member dies.  \n \nA matured elephant eats around 170 kg foods and 80 litres of water and this amount increases in the rainy season when an elephant eats more than 200 kg foods. Elephants can walk almost noiselessly because of the soft cushions they have under their foot. Finally, elephants are social animals and they live in a herd. They obey the rules and responsibilities of their society and the mother elephants teach the baby elephants about the rules and responsibilities much like the humans do."

    "Answer": "This is an interesting topic for me because I have attended several public events before, and I must say that I have enjoyed almost all of them. So, today, I would like to talk about an event, which I attended about 6 years ago, in order to raise some funds for the flood victims of my country.\n\nAs I just mentioned earlier, it was a fundraising event, and I really felt very passionate about it as I also wanted to become a part of the noble effort. In fact, a significant part of my country was flooded in that year because of heavy monsoon rain as well as for some other man-made factors. Anyway, so when some of my friends asked me to attend the fundraising event, I immediately agreed.\n\nInitially, I didn’t think that so many people would be attending the event because of significant damage in the road and transportation system of that part of my country, where I lived, but I was proved to be wrong because thousands of people attended the event with all kinds of material helps and support. By the way, the organizers of the event held a public concert, which included some of the famous bands and singers of my country, and theatrical display of the sufferings and miseries of the people who were badly affected by the flood. At the event, a keynote speaker, who also happened to be a prominent social worker and member of parliament of my country, gave us an account of damage and destruction in my country, caused by one of the devastating floods in the history of my country.\n\nAnyway, as for what I did at the event, I already collected some dry food and clothes, before coming to the event, so that the people, in charge of collecting the relief funds there, could distribute them among the affected people. Besides, since there were not enough volunteer there to take care of such a large gathering, I helped the event organizers to clean up the mess, like trash and food wastes, after it was over."

It was probably the month of January and I was a student at the university at that time. I heard that the Argentina Football team would come to our country and would play a football match against our football team. I was a fan of this football team (...mention any other team name which you like...) and wanted to enjoy the football match. This was one of the most enjoyable football tournament I have seen live. Though I liked the Argentine team, I supported our team from the very beginning.\n\nI had to collect the ticket 30 days prior to the game day and on the day I went to the national stadium with some of my friends. The game started in the 3.30 pm and I noticed there were more than 20 thousand spectators in the stadium. I attended the game with 4 of my friends plus roommates who were very close to me. We sat in the front row of the north gallery and we enjoyed the whole game. We shouted when our team did well, we showed our dismay when they performed badly. One of our friends took the national flag and he bore it during the game. We left the stadium in the evening and even though our team was defeated by the powerful Argentine team, we were happy that our team competed them well and performed quite good."

Later on, of course, I got busy in the professional world and, as a result, I couldn’t quite pay attention to cricket in the way I would have loved to, but the appeal of this great sport never got diminished to me. So, when I got an opportunity to play that sport again about a couple of years ago, I didn’t hesitate to hit the field.\n\nIt was a club-level match between two old clubs in my hometown, and I used to play for one of these two clubs when I was a college student. The captain of my team, which included 11 players altogether, told me that I would primarily play in the team as a specialist batsman. I could bowl a little as well, but my captain didn’t really need my help in that department since there were way better bowlers than me in the team.\n\nAnyway, it was a weekend, and so, I would say that a reasonably fair number of spectators, as many as 500 of them, came to the field to watch the game. The game started at around 10:00 am and continued till 6:00 pm in the afternoon since it was 50 overs match. By the way, my team chose to bat first after winning the toss, and we amassed well over 270 runs. Needless to say, we won the match since our opponent team couldn’t even get close to the runs my team had got on the scorecard.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed the game a lot since my team won the match. Of course, I didn’t do that well in the match, but still, it was a great experience as it helped me to get together with some of my old friends and co-teammates. Besides, it also brought back some confidence in me, as far as my physical ability was concerned, which I thought I had lost because of not playing the sport for a long time."

Sometimes I played with my friends outside and those were mostly friendly game. I would like to describe a cricket match I participated in my high school level against another school cricket team. \n\nI was around 15-16 years old at that time and was in grade 9. I played for my school cricket team and I participated in some of the games against other teams. Our cricket team participated in an inter-division cricket tournament and I was one of the team members. We defeated some of the teams and qualified to play the final match against the Crescent High school team. \n\nOn the day I noticed that more than 500 people including our teachers and students of our school were present. The cricket ground was in a festive mode. Our team won the toss and elected to bat. We did well in our batting part and totalled 125 in 20 overs. We had many supporters and I played well.\n\nAfter 10 overs of the opponent's playing, the match became very tight. Both teams had a chance to win and spectators were enjoying this match very much. I took 3 wickets and fulfilled my overs. In the last over, the other team needed 10 more runs to win and we needed 2 wickets to win the match. To our surprise, the opponent batsman hit a boundary the match was in their favour then. We gathered together and made some plans. The last 3 balls were very exciting and the opponent needed to score two in the last ball. With luck and the quality bowling of our bowlers, we won the match. We were heavily congratulated and won several prizes. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and our winning increased this joy and happiness."

And, probably that’s why we see that people around us today are desperately trying to possess things, whether they need them or not, only because those possessions would supposedly enhance their “status”.  Today, I would like to talk about one such thing that people like to have in their homes.\n\nThe name of this thing is called a “big screen TV”.  Some people like to call it a super big TV.  But, please don’t think that I also own one such big-screen TV.  In fact, I am very much against such materialistic nonsense.

It could be also because they probably earn more money than me!  \n\nAnyway, earning more money or not, many people, at least in my society, like to have super big TV, also, because it offers them an opportunity to enjoy many entertaining shows, like movies, sports, TV reality shows, travel shows and many other programmes, in a more relaxing and better manner because these super big TV’s have better picture quality and sound system.  After all, if you have a big screen TV, all the family members of a home would be able to see the TV from all corners of a room.  Besides, some people like to have big screen TV’s just to decorate their living rooms or sitting areas also.\n\nAnyway, whatever are the reasons, for which, people want to have these big TV, they influence them to create some kind of artificial class separation among themselves, which creates some unwarranted jealousy or hatred in society.  Besides, this costly fashion of spending fortune in buying big screen TV put unnecessary strain on the budgets and resources of families, which could be used to take care of other important things."

    "Answer": "Nowadays mobile phones have become a matter of status and a fashion item that most of the people in my country use. Besides, this device has great importance in the way we communicate with others.\n\nPeople use it for the convenience it offers and they also consider it as a matter of pride and prestige. With the technological advancement, the utility of this device has expanded. A cell phone is no longer a device to talk to others and to send-receive SMS, rather it comes with two high-resolution cameras, music and video playing capability, FM radio, internet modem, Wi-Fi, games, social networking applications, video calling etc. facilities. People have become very fond of this device and the teenagers consider it a must-have gadget.\n\nFor official and business communications, cell phones are widely used and it is replacing the land phones rapidly. Day by day the price of the cell phones, talk time rates, internet using rates are falling down and as a consequence people with low economic earnings are also extensively using the cell phones for their communications.\n\nI stay far away from my hometown where my family members live. To communicate them I find my cell phone very handy and the lowest expensive among the ways I have to communicate them. I also use it to contact my friends, classmates and teachers. Besides, I listen to music and use the internet using my cell phone. I update my blog; maintain social networking via my cell phone. I have become heavily dependent on the cell phone I own and to some extent, it is a fashion item to me as I could have easily purchased a low-budget phone instead of the expensive smartphone I have. For my communication, entertainment and educational reasons I keep it with me almost 24 hours a day and thus, this cell phone has become an essential device that I like to use."

    "Answer": "This is such a challenging topic for me because among a few things, which I really dislike to do, is to tell negative things about people around me, be them my neighbour or some mere acquaintances.  But, that doesn’t necessarily mean that I didn’t have to deal with some annoying neighbours at some points of my life, and today I would like to talk about one such neighbour who I wish was a bit less annoying at times.\n\nAnyway, the irritating neighbour, I am talking about, is a businessman, and a successful one in that, who likes to travel to different parts of my country rather frequently for business purpose.  Nobody should find any issue with such a hard-working and successful businessman as his or her neighbour except, of course, the neighbour continuously keeps boasting about his business success while demeaning or belittling his neighbours at every opportunity because of their professions or beliefs.  For example, he didn’t like my teaching profession because he thought that the only PhD degree holders, which I wasn’t, should get the opportunity to teach students.  Now, I understand that he was a very authoritative person, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that he could shout at his subordinates and insult them in front of others because of some petty mistakes.\n\nBesides, he also thought that it was his “birth-right” to park his large wagon sometimes anywhere in our neighbourhood even if it was blocking the passage or exit route of his neighbours.  Anyway, I am not too sure as to why he is such an annoying person, but I guess that it must have to do with growing up in a rough neighbourhood with no proper guidance.\n\nOf course, we can help him to change his annoying behaviour by engaging with him on a more regular basis, instead of actually avoiding him, and tell him how his behaviour hurts us.  We could also praise him more about his business success and ask about his health, family and well-being so that he understands that we actually care about him like some good neighbours."

    "Answer": "Mr. / Mrs. (...say a name i.e. David/ Fiona/ Kumar/Sonia/ Maroof...) is a very annoying neighbour who lives across the street. S/he would be around 50 years old and has a really irritating personality that bothers us all.\n\nI have seen him/her living there from my childhood and s/he's still living there. S/he is a short-tempered person who uses his/her mouth far more than his/her brain.\n\nSometimes s/he yells aloud and uses very vulgar languages for very silly reasons. We thought that s/he had some sort of mental instability but that was not correct. Actually, his/her attitude and behaviours with others are so rude that people get confused and surprised. I have never found a person who can use so mean and vulgar language only kids went on to play near his/her house. S/he never returns the balls kids throw inside his/her fence unintentionally. S/he can scream and shout continuously and even with a 5 year's kid. Though s/he complaints always about others, s/he does lots of stuff which s/he would not allow others to do. He/she is, in my opinion, a bad neighbour who never helps anyone. He watches TV and listens to the radio with a very loud sound at night, screams with his family members, throws water in the street, does not keep his yard clean, and puts the garbage in unauthorised places.\n\nI am not sure what would actually work to pacify him/her but I guess s/he needs some friends and close family members who would accompany him/her and politely advises him/her. Maybe his loneliness and introvert lifestyle are two reasons for his rude behaviours and that can be done by people whom he would yield to. I have never seen him/her going out on vacations and I feel s/he needs to visit different places and change the monotonous life s/he is living."

    "Answer": "Having laws allows us to protect our rights and safety in society. So, it is absolutely important that we don’t only have laws but also abide by them at every step to make sure that we don’t abuse each other and take unfair advantages of the poor and weak ones. Today, I would like to talk about one such law which I really like.\n\nThis law is called the “Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007”. This legislation was enacted in 2007, initiated by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India to provide more effective provision for maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens.\n\nThe law makes it a legal obligation for sons and daughters, and heirs to provide maintenance to senior citizens and parents, by proving a monthly allowance. I feel that this is a very timely initiative and law because it provides a simple, speedy and inexpensive mechanism for the protection of life and property of the older persons, regardless of their gender, religion, race and ethnicity. Besides, this law makes it mandatory for the children, grandchildren and other relatives to take care of maintaining the elderly citizens by applying to the courts. However, the great thing about this law is that after being passed by the parliament of India received the assent of President of India on December 29, 2007, and was published in the Gazette of India on December 31, 2007,  many states in India have already implemented the act.    \n\nAnyway, I like this law because it allows our senior citizens to feel both mentally and financially secured, at a time when they are not able to do anything productive, not only for their society but also for themselves. Besides, the law also goes a long way to repay back some of the contributions of our elderly citizens who have worked tirelessly for their entire life in order to benefit our society and country.  All in all, I think that it is a great law to prove the fact that we live in a civilized society who take care of each other."

    "Answer": "The law that prevents child labour is the one I really appreciate and like. The law regarding child labour prevents employers from engaging anyone below 18 years old to be engaged in any work that possesses a threat to the child.\n\nThough I am not an employer and do not face the situation where I need to decide whether I should involve a child to such work, I should not say if I abide by this law or not. Nevertheless, I fully support the law and would never violate it. If I am even remotely involved in abiding by this law, I would definitely obey this law.\n\nI feel that this is an important law and everybody should abide by this law. Children are our next generation and their safety should be our priority. So we should never engage them in hazardous work and should make sure that they are getting the proper education. Though the government and the parents of those kids have a responsibility to nurture them and ensure their education, sometimes it is beyond their control and each of us should make sure that we are not violating this law.\n\nI like this law because it prevents the greedy employers to engage the children in hazardous and dangerous works because of the low payment they need to pay these children. The children who should be at school and in the playground should not get involved in works that possess dangers to them. Since this law strictly prohibits the citizens from doing such a thing that ruin the children future, I really feel great respect for this law."

    "Answer": "The world has witnessed many historical events from the beginning of its existence. While all of these events have impacted our world in one way or another, there are very few events as important as “The French Revolution” that swept the world with all sorts of dramatic changes.\n\nNow, to understand the French revolution, that took place between 1789 and 1799, one has to have some ideas about the situation that was prevailing in France between 1789 and 1799, as well as preceding that era. In fact, the common French people were outraged with the fact their king Louis XVI and his predecessor left the country completely bankrupted by getting involved in the American revolutions during the mid 18th century, as well as by extravagant and unnecessary spending by their administration. On top of that, two decades of poor harvests prior, drought, cattle disease and skyrocketing bread prices prior to that had kindled unrest among peasants and the urban poor among the French people.\n\nMany expressed their desperation and resentment toward a regime that imposed heavy taxes – yet failed to provide any relief – by rioting, looting and striking. And, it was in this context that the French revolution had taken place. Anyway, the event has tremendously impacted the world history because it was after this revolution the growing exodus of nobles from the country took place, ultimately leading to the abolition of feudalism on August 4, 1789.\n\nAnyway, this event is a very important and interesting one because it is after this revolution that the charter of declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen was adopted by all the progressive forces around the world in light of democratic principles, grounded in the philosophical and political ideas of Enlightenment thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Besides, this event essentially and practically plucked out the oppressive monarchy system in whole Europe.  Besides, it had also helped people enjoy better life in terms getting better jobs and better education. The French revolution helped the entire world to move forward by leaving all kinds of old ideas behind."

    "Answer": "The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914, in my opinion, is a historical event that I find interesting. This single event resulted in one of the most devastating wars known as the First World War.\n\nThis significant historical event took place on 28th June 1914 when six assassins shot him and his wife dead on that day and that created a great hit in the world, especially in Europe.\n\nThere was a political objective of this assassination and that was to break down the Austria- Hungary’s provinces to form a greater Serbia. Because of this event, the world and political condition in Europe got unrested and thus the event caused the First World War.\n\nI specifically find this event interesting because of the political motivation, planning and aftermath this event has. Though this seems like an ordinary assassination, yet it caused one of the most deadly wars in the world because of which millions of people died."

    "Answer": "From my childhood, especially from my early high school days, I had a habit of getting involved with different clubs or organizations, such as sports clubs, debate club and social activities clubs. However, while I liked joining any kinds of clubs, that allowed me to remain physically and mentally active, I preferred the “social activity” club a bit more than others.\n\nAnyway, I joined the social activity club when I was in high school about 15 years ago. Initially, when I joined the club, there weren’t too many members with us, but as time progressed, more and more students showed their interests in joining our club after watching our activities. By the way, it was me who actually took the initiative to form the club and took permission from my school authority to use an unused room to run the activities of our club, and we used to sit there almost every day to discuss and plan our activities, which included collecting data and information about the elderly citizens of our neighbourhoods, keeping the ponds and lakes as clean as possible and visiting different hospitals and clinics to know if any patients needed any medicine or blood.  \n\nWe also used to collect old clothing items and shoes in advance in order to provide them to the poor and needy during extreme cold. On top of that, we also used to organize picnics in our respective areas and invite people from the less privileged segment of our society so that they could also enjoy some good food every once in a while.\n\nAnyway, I thoroughly enjoyed being part of this social activity club, primarily because it allowed me to spend some quality time with my friends. Besides, joining the club also allowed me to learn different kinds of things by communicating different kinds of people from all walks of life, professions and backgrounds. Finally, I just loved joining this club because it helped me remain physically and mentally active while giving my much-needed confidence in getting things done in an effective and professional manner. All in all, I am glad that I formed and joined the club."

This group has encouraged us to read books by famous authors of different eras. The name of the group was ‘Let's Enlighten’ and it was a non-profit organisation that had a good collection of books from around the world. It also encouraged us to read and share our own books.\n\nI joined the group when I lived in my hometown and was a student at the college. I was around 16 years old then. There were more than 100 members in this group and we used to meet at the group’s library complex. There were several rooms and a large library and we used to gather there once in a week in the evening.\n\nI enjoyed being a member of this group because of the opportunity to meet people who loved to read books and liked to share their experience regarding different books and authors. Because of my membership, I had been able to take books home from their library. I also met many people there who later became my friends. The members used to share their interest in books and recommend many books worth reading. Sometimes the senior members explained the writing style of famous writers and the central themes of their books which encouraged me to read many famous books. I still feel that I was lucky to be a part of this group."

    "Answer": "No doubt that TV is one of the most wonderful tools for entertainment in today’s world. But, it can’t do any wonder just by itself. It needs several performers and artists to actually make it work, and a TV presenter is one such performer who undoubtedly plays an important role in making things interesting for us. Anyway, today, I would like to talk about one such TV presenter whom I know and admire a lot.\n\nThe name of this TV presenter is Jon Stewart.  Being born in 1962, Jon Stewart started his career as a stand-up American comedian from 1993. Since then, he never really had to look back as his career as a TV personality only grew more and more popular among his audience while hosting shows like “The daily show” (an American late-night talk and news satire television programme, describing itself as a fake news programme.\n\nThe Daily Show draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humour as well), The comedy Central (also an American pay television channel which is geared for mature audiences and carries comedy programming in the form of both original, licensed, and syndicated series, stand-up comedy specials, and feature films).\n\nJon Stewart, one of the most popular and prolific TV presenters of the modern times in my opinion, also hosted a show called “The John Stewart Show”, which also was a late-night comedy show.  Anyway, Jon Stewart has his own way of presenting his shows, which seems so controversial and yet so articulate in substance and appeal.\n\nAnyway, I like Jon Stewart, primarily because I have never really seen any other TV presenter or personality to bring the “truth” out in such satirical and cruel fashion. I also like the fact that when he presents his comedy, how somehow manages to keep his audience dead quiet in front of him with his extraordinary charm and wit.  I also like him because he is a multi-talented person. In fact, he is only a stand-out comedian but also a director, producer, writer and political commentator."

We, as listeners of the radio programmes, know very little personal information about the radio presenters and the person I am talking about would be around 25 years old and is a full-time radio presenter. S/he is currently presenting the weather updates, which is a program called ‘Weather Today’ and I find his presenting the program very informative and interesting.\n\nSince s/he presents the weather updates, s/he mostly depends on the weather reports provided to him/her and sometimes s/he makes his/her own thought and some humour in the presentation.\n\nS/he has an attractive and clear voice and that makes the information easily listenable. He has a different style of presenting the weather-related data and mainly because of that the ‘Weather today’ program has gained its popularity. S/he describes the overall weather condition based on different locations of the country and then gives some tips to the listeners.\n\nI find his/ her weather report interesting and informative that’s why I like this radio reporter very much.

    "Answer": "As a child, I never really shied away from taking up on any challenge whether climbing up a big tree or jumping into a river from a dangerous height. So, when some of my friends challenged me to cross a lake, which was more than half a kilometre from one end to the other, in just 10 minutes, I immediately decided to do it.\n\nOf course, it was not the first time that I crossed the lake. In fact, I had crossed the lake a number of times prior to that occasion but the only difference was that this time I would have to do it within a stipulated period of time of 10 minutes. By the way, since my childhood from the age of 10/11, I just loved swimming whether I was doing on a rainy day or just a hot summer day. In fact, during the hot summer day, I would enjoy swimming more than playing with my friends or eat some of my favourite snacks with them. So, anyway, even though, I knew that it was going to be a huge challenge to cross that lake within 10 minutes, I still started to swim to prove a point or two.\n\nInitially, I was swimming at a moderate speed, by trying not to swing my hands and feet too quickly, as I didn’t want to get tired too quickly. Then, after a while, I realized that at that speed I would never be able to reach the other end of the lake. So, I started to speed up gradually while breathing slowly and easily. Finally, I did manage to cross the lake within just 10 minutes!\n\nAnyway, after crossing the lake, I felt so happy and excited that I actually forgot about all my tiredness. On the other hand, friends and people around me started to call me “daredevil”, which I actually enjoyed a lot at that time. Finally, after managing to cross the lake all by myself, I learned a very important lesson which was that slow and steady pace wins the race, just like I won on that occasion."

    "Answer": "I had a very amazing and magical childhood and I spent most of my childhood days in my hometown which was a beautiful place and offered lots of adventures and pleasures to me. There are many adventurous things I can remember from my childhood and among those, I would like to talk about my first attempt to climb a big tree to find the nest of a bird.\n\nI was around 7 years old at that time. With two or three other kids, one day I went to play near a big garden where we often used to play. Suddenly I notice that a few birds were chattering at the top of a tree and we assumed that the bird's nest must have some eggs. We got curious about the bird’s egg and I decided to climb the tree and reach the top to see it myself.\n\nThe tree was really big and it was dangerous for me to climb on top of it. But I was so excited and mesmerised that I forgot the danger and started climbing the tree. I was not a good climber but I that did not restrain me from fulfilling what I targeted. After some effort, I was able to climb at the top of the tree and then I found that the harder part is still was unfinished. The nest was at the edge of a very thin branch of the tree and I won’t be able to reach there to see the bird’s eggs. Then I started approaching there very slowly and found that my fellow playmates were already worried about it. I forgot everything around me and found the idea of reaching near the nest is the only target I have to fulfil. After I managed to reach near the nest, I found four-five very beautiful small birds with red lips and they were playing with their mother bird. The mother bird started getting worried about my presence and then I decided not to interrupt them. The mother bird somehow reminded me of my mother who takes care of her children the same way! Finally, I started to climb down from the tree.\n\nThat was a very adventurous thing to do for me in my childhood and I did it out of inquisitiveness that a child usually feels for new thins. I felt a great attraction in finding what there might be and that’s why I did it. Luckily, grown-up people were not there and after a few months when I told my mother about what I did on that day, she became very anxious and rebuked me for that. She told me never to do anything like this ever again. Whenever I think about that particular event of my childhood, I feel great joy. It reminds me of the greener and fairy-tale like childhood I had. I remember this event with great joy and ecstasy."

    "Answer": "I never really considered myself to be in a position to provide any kind of advice to anybody. In fact, it always would be the other way around because many times, it was actually me who needed advice from other people. So, when my one of my junior cousins asked me about whether to join a football club or not about 10 years ago from now, I felt pretty dumb because I just didn’t know what to suggest.\n\n But, then I gathered my thoughts (as I didn’t want to look stupid in front of my junior cousin) and told him that he should have joined the football club. Needless to say, it was for the first time that I actually gave someone a piece of real advice. But, after giving that advice to my cousin, I became a bit worried and nervous, because I just didn’t know how my uncle would react to it. In fact, when I also showed some interest in playing any kind of sports in the past, my uncle vehemently opposed the idea since, according to him, it would jeopardize my study and education.\n\nSo, naturally, I thought that my uncle wouldn’t exactly favour my advice as far as the issue of telling his son to join a football club was concerned. But, I also prepared myself to argue with my uncle, should he demand some kind of explanation from me on offering the advice. But, then, to my pleasant surprise, nothing of that sort really took place. In fact, my uncle actually asked me to find a good football club for his son so that he could practice some good football.\n\nAnyway, even though, I was initially nervous about giving that advice to my cousin, I felt really good later on because, after all, my uncle had finally understood the value of getting involved with different kinds of sports for health benefits. I also felt a bit proud of myself because someone (my cousin) thought that it was actually worth asking a person like me for some advice, no matter how important or generic the advice really was."

I gave several pieces of advice to others, mostly to my friends and relatives, and one such advice I still remember and feel good about was the one that I gave to one of my classmates when I was in the college.\n\nI advised him to continue his study no matter what. The friend whom I gave advice was (…say a name…) and I talked to him for more than 3 hours. He one day told me that he had been planning to quit college and get involved in some kind of job to support his family. That was, in my opinion, a very wrong decision as it would ruin every possibility he has in his career and he would have to work on low-level jobs for the rest of his life. I advised him not to drop out of college and study hard. I showed him some of the examples where others are supporting their family even after continuing their study. I told him that it would be very tough and sometimes you would feel like abandoning the college but don’t even think of doing it. I also advised him to manage any part-time job in the local library or to talk to our teacher about his condition.\n\nAfter a few days, he told me that he had given some serious thought about it and won’t quit college. I felt overwhelmed and happy to hear that. He talked to our course teachers and one of the teachers arranged him a part-time job. He was happy and he finally finished his graduation from one of the prestigious universities of our country. Now he is working in a respectable government office and he is still grateful to me for the advice I gave him. I felt very well when I found him continuing his study and in fact, he was a bright student. I still feel very glad to be able to give him a piece of advice that proved to be very helpful for him."

I took it myself using what would now be thought of as an old-fashioned camera with traditional film. I can’t remember exactly what year it was, but it was probably around 2005. The photograph is of my uncle and aunt with their daughter, my niece. My uncle was born in the UK but ended up working in America, eventually taking American citizenship. I didn’t get to see him very often. Unfortunately, just before this photo was taken my uncle found out he was very ill, so I travelled out to America to visit him and his family, knowing that I might not get the chance to see him again.\n\nBecause it was my first time in America, they took me out and about to see the sights. The photograph was taken on a day we went to New York. It was pouring with rain, and really blustery. In the picture, my uncle and aunt are both holding black umbrellas, and the one my uncle is hanging onto has turned inside out in the wind. My niece, who was probably in her late teens then, is standing between them, and they are all laughing because the torrential rain had thoroughly drenched everyone. In the background is a yellow cab, and the streets are awash with water. It ought to have been a miserable day, but we had to see the funny side because the atrocious weather was so extreme, and it was madness for us to pick such a day to go exploring in the city!\n\nI really like the photo because in it everyone looks happy and relaxed. Although the photo was a bit posed – they knew I was photographing them, the weather was so appalling it has a spontaneous feel to it, my relatives were reacting to the rain rather than to me the photographer. It was also incredibly lucky that the photo came out so well. In the days before digital cameras, you would just take one snapshot of an occasion and hope for the best. This is a brilliant photo, it’s flattering everyone, and captures each individual animated and amused by the elements.\n\nI have very few photos of my uncle, but I keep this one of him with his family on display in my flat. It reminds me of a really happy time and is how I want to remember him too. Looking at the photo makes me smile rather than feel sad – he looks so joyful with his family - and what better way to celebrate someone’s life than to remember them with affection, laughter and celebration long after they have gone? This photograph is special, as it enables me to do that every day!"

Of course, I was assured by my grandfather that he would visit me on a regular basis, and he kept his promise by visiting me only a few weeks after we had left my grandfather’s place. Anyway, in that picture, I am seen to be running towards my grandfather while my grandfather extending his two hands in a very emotional manner to hug me.

In our house, we have many photo albums which are full of different photos of our family members including me. Among all the photographs, my favourite photograph is the one that depicts my father in his early childhood. This photograph was taken at least 60 years ago when my father was around 5-6 years old.\n\nAs I heard from my grandmother, this picture was taken by a professional photographer from a distant town on the occasion of my father’s birthday. In the photograph, my father was wearing a shirt, short pant and a pair of shoes. He was sitting in a chair and the background was the garden where the picture was taken. This black-and-white photograph and two years back the photo was retouched by a professional photo editor.\n\nThis is a very important photograph to me as it depicts a time and moment that I would have never been known to in any other way. This is the only photograph of my father from his childhood and it gives me ideas about how he was at that moment. I revere this photograph and somehow it reminds me of the similarities that I have with my father."

    "Answer": "I love reading different kinds of books, especially, when I am on holidays or vacation. Luckily, I am on a long holiday, and I am using it to read one of the best books I have ever read. The name of this book is “Where the Forest Meets the Stars”.\n\nWritten by Glendy Venderah, an American writer and also a renowned bird specialist, this domestic fiction was published in the year of 2019. Since then, the book has received a lot of praise from its readers.\n\nThe book is about a post-graduate young lady, Joanna Teale, who had lost her mother with breast cancer, went back to do her research work at one of the universities in Illinois, USA.  There she throws herself into hard work from dawn to dusk until her solitary routine is disrupted by the appearance of a mysterious child, who shows up at her cabin barefoot and covered in bruises.  When Joanna asked the mysterious child about herself, the child simply told her that her name was Ursa and that she had been sent from the stars to witness five miracles. With concerns about the child’s home situation, Jo reluctantly agrees to let her stay—just until she learns more about Ursa’s past. Later on, Joanna decides seeks help from one of her neighbour called “Gabriel Nash”, to solve the mystery of the charming child, but things become more and more interesting.  \n\nAnyway, this is how far, probably midway through to the book, I have read since I started to read it only a couple of days ago.  But, I am sure, more mystery and interesting things are waiting for me ahead.\n\nAnyway, I haven’t finished reading the book, and yet, I already like the fact that the book is written in simple words and phrases so that anybody can understand and enjoy reading it. The book also tries to show us that it is our duty to help any person in distress, whether she is our neighbour, or she is coming from a different world.  All in all, it has been a good read so far."

    "Answer": "I have started reading the book ‘Sense and Sensibility’ by Jane Austen 2-3 weeks ago and got so busy with other stuff that I am yet to finish it.\n\nThis book was written by a very famous writer named Jane Austen and it was about the love and life of two sisters. This novel is best known as a work of romantic fiction of comedy and manners. I usually read books on my day-off and at night after I return from my work.\n\nI have been reading it for more than 2-3 weeks and have finished more than half of the book. Since I got busy with my work and exam, I had not been able to finish it yet. I usually read about one hour at night and sometimes more than an hour if I have a day off the next day.\n\nThe writing and narration of Jane Austen are incomparable. She is one of the most revered women writers who had a great charisma to depict the society, people and culture of the old England. This book represents such characters and I like the way the story was told. It vividly represents the good and bad manners and characteristics we have and then shows a perfect balance of those characteristics and morality. I am in fact enjoying reading the book as I have enjoyed other novels by this famous writer."

    "Answer": "I think that there is no better feeling than enjoying a great meal after a long and hard day at work. Of course, some people just love to eat whether he is working or not. Then, of course, there are others who like to eat good food only when there is an occasion for it. But, as for me, I like to eat it during the weekend with my friends after a good physical exercise and work out.\n\nWell, to tell the truth, just even the thought of eating a sirloin steak makes my mouth watery. In fact, it is almost impossible to forget the heavenly taste of juicy sirloin steak, soaked in some black pepper and mushroom sauce. But, unfortunately, I don’t really get to eat it as often as I possibly could, mainly because I can’t prepare it at home. So, all I do instead is just to visit the restaurant once a week to enjoy one of my most favourite meals of all time.\n\nAnyway, to cook this food item, first remove the steaks from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature. Then preheat the oven to 180°C and then place a frying pan over high heat after putting a good dash of oil in it.  Later, season the steaks liberally with flaky sea salt. When the oil is hot, add the steaks carefully to the pan and cook for 2 and a half minutes until beautifully golden on the underside. Then, turn the steaks over and add some butter, thyme and a few garlic cloves. Finally, baste the steak with the butter and once golden on the underside, place it in the oven for 2–3 minutes, remove the steaks from the pan and allow to rest in a warm place for 5 minutes before serving.\n\nAnyway, this meal is important for this occasion because it gives me and my friends some real energy after some exhausting physical work and exercise. This is also important because it is during this time all of my friends manage to get together and enjoy some quality time together."

    "Answer": "On different occasions, we eat different special meals and some of the items are very common on such special occasions. One such meal that we often eat on special occasion is the Pilaf (also known as pulao, pilav and polao in some countries), salad and mutton.  \n\nWe eat this special meal usually at our major festivals like New Year, wedding and different social party. This is a special meal people usually prepare for special occasions and this is widely liked in our country.\n\nThe meal is usually served either at lunch or at dinner. People do not have it in the morning as this is a kind of rich food. A special type of rice is used to prepare the pilaf and depending on the local cuisine and custom, fish, vegetables and dried fruits are also added to the rice. The salad is prepared with various kinds of vegetables and fruits and sometimes onions, and special edible oils are added sometimes.\n\nThe important on a meal for an occasion mostly depends on the custom and preferences of the people of a geographical region. For hundreds of years, it is a tradition in our country to cook and serve this special meal on special occasions. Another reason why people prefer to eat this meal on a special occasion is that it is very much delicious and the ingredients required for preparing for this menu is available in our country."

    "Answer": "I live in a beautiful country which takes different looks in different seasons just as it takes a different look during the winter season also. In fact, I prefer winter season a bit more to the other seasons because I can do a lot of things during this time. One such thing that I really like doing during this season is to attend a special cake festival.\n\nThis cake festival is undoubtedly one of the most popular food festivals of my country since people from all over of my county gather at a certain place in the city, where I live, with all kinds of “pitha” ( “cake” in plain English) which are mostly made from date palm jaggery.\n\nThis particular festival takes place mostly during the late afternoon time and can continue until mid night. The participants of this festival make so many different kinds of cakes with so many different shapes and sizes that it will be almost impossible to try them all in just one day. Needless to say, all of the cakes there taste just so delicious as they all have different taste, flavour and aroma.\n\nBy the way, it must be mentioned here that a lot of efforts and times go behind preparing these delicious cakes. Anyway, apart from date palm jaggery, regular sugar and brown sugar are also used to make other kinds of cakes which also taste good. However, these cakes by no means are cheap, so one has to be ready to pay a handsome amount of money to try those delicious cakes. But, of course, I and my friends don’t really have to pay much money because we all have been given some kind of discount cards to buy them at a cheaper rate. Lucky us!\n\nAnyway, I like this particular activity during the winter time, mainly because I just love to eat those delicious cakes which are not normally made at my home. Besides, it also offers me an opportunity to meet different kinds of interesting people from different parts of my country and build some kind of friendship with them."

    "Answer": "Winter usually lasts for three months in our country and apart from the extreme winter days, people enjoy this season to a great extent. Lifestyles and activities of people between summertime and winter seasons differ noticeably, and we often do things in winter that we do not like to do in the summer season. One activity that I particularly enjoy doing during the winter season is playing badminton.  \n\nIt has become a custom in our country to play the badminton during the winter season. At the beginning of the winter season, I ask some of my friends to prepare a badminton court near our home and then arrange other equipment and tools that we need to play this game. Usually, after 8:00 we gather in the playground and play for about two hours.\n\nPlaying badminton is a good way of exercising and I love to play this game. This is a great way of physical exertion as well as an enjoyable game. Apart from that, it helps our friends to have a reason to get together even in our tight and busy schedule. For all these reasons, I like this particular activity during the winter season."

    "Answer": "I am actually a simple guy, so it doesn’t really take much for me to feel happy or excited whether I am reading a story teller or just going to eat some nice meal at a good restaurant. But, today, I would like to talk about a thing which, I think, makes me happier than anything else.\n\nThis thing, I am talking about, is travelling. Yes, I just love travelling. In fact, I just wish that I had a lot of money so that I could travel all of my life. But, unfortunately, I have to work to earn my living and on top of that, I am not a rich person either. So, that means I have to plan well in advance in order to save up some money for doing some travelling.\n\nOf course, it is not that I want to travel every place that I learn about after reading about them on some books or by watching different kinds of travel-related programmes on TV, but rather I like to travel only those places that are absolutely unique and different from other places. However, the funny thing is that it is actually the anticipation of travelling to a new place which makes me happier rather than actually visiting the place, probably because once I visit that place, the excitement will just simply vanish away. But, still, I like to travel as often as I can, especially, when I get the yearly vacation from my work. So, I guess that visiting more than once a year is something I can hardly afford.\n\nAnyway, travelling makes me happy, mainly because it allows me to become familiar with the different kinds of cultures and lifestyles of different kinds of people. Besides, it also allows me to develop an appreciation for people, who are different from me, while also allowing me to find some better career opportunities. Finally, it makes me happy and excited because travelling allows me to extend my hands of friendship to other people who I have never met before. After all, who don’t like to make new friends and learn about new things?"

    "Answer": "Playing computer games, especially strategy games make me excited and happy. This might sound a bit odd but I often find a great deal of excitement playing computer games with my friends over the computer network. I do not play computer games that much nowadays. But in my college and university years, I often played computer games with my friends after the semester end. This was great excitement for me and still, it is exciting to me. I usually play computer games once a month when my and my friends' schedule matches.\n\nPlaying strategy games is exciting by it’s the activities it involves and by the completion a gamer has to face. The gamer is the ultimate controller of the gaming characters and fighting, bloodsheds, cultivation, collecting resources in a virtual world gives me a feeling of controlling and leading a whole nation. Since we play in a network, there is a great competition among the friends to build an empire and then to fight hard to survive. By its very nature, computer games, especially strategy games, are exciting."

    "Answer": "I have many friends who have different kinds of hobbies. Of course, it all depends on their moods, circumstances, trends as well as the weather. However, today I would like to talk about one of those friends of mine who likes to enjoy cycling whenever he gets time. The friend, I am talking about here, is one of my childhood friends from my high school.\n\nMy friend, Ryan, wasn’t really a very active person like the other boys of his age when he was attending high school. In fact, when we were enjoying playing football or badminton with other friends of mine, Ryan would sit on the sideline and enjoy our game. In other words, he was more of a spectator than a participant of the game.\n\nBut, everything changed, if I remember it correctly, when he got a bicycle as a gift from one of his uncles. By the way, the gift was given to Ryan because of finishing his junior college with a top grade, and also because of getting admission at one of the prestigious colleges of my country. Since then, Ryan actually became addicted to cycling whenever he would manage some extra time outside of his studies. Sometimes, he would even refuse to hang out with us because he would want to spend time cleaning his bicycle and checking its parts in order to make sure that his bicycle was in good shape. Anyway, Ryan would love to ride his bicycle anytime or any season, but he would love it even more during the summertime. \n\nIn my humble opinion, I think that it is a good hobby because it keeps Ryan physically active, especially, when he doesn’t like any other physical activities. Besides, this particular hobby also allows him to become close to the mother nature in the outdoor in order to feel more lively instead of just sitting at home idle. Finally, I think that this hobby also gives my friend a boost in his confidence to socialize with others, a good habit he lacks."

One of my friends, whose name is (...say a name...), collects autographs of famous people and this is in my opinion, is an interesting hobby. This friend is nurturing this hobby for more than 15 years and he has a good collection of autographs of many famous personalities of our country as well as some internationally renowned persons.\n\nIn my early childhood, we were surprised to notice that he has great courage and patience to go near a famous person even in tight security and finally taking this person's autograph. We sometimes enjoyed it and sometimes we found ourself surprised by the amount of effort and passion he could put on it. Later on, we thought that it is an adolescence passion would go away with time. But surprisingly he still has this same hobby and a few months back when he showed me his collection of autographs, I was simply speechless. He has a collection of more than 2000 autographs in his diary, books and in other places including many world-renowned writers, politicians, actors, players and other famous people.\n\nI value his passion and inspiration for collecting the autograph and that's why I possess positive thinking about this hobby of my friend. Having some kind of activity and passion is always positive and this helps us learning many new things and experiencing many new things which otherwise would not have been possible. So I would opine that this is a good hobby and I am proud of my friend for his hobby and great collection."

    "Answer": "The song 'High Hopes' sung by David Gilmour of Pink Floyd band is a song I have loved always and would hear often for the rest of my life. Pink Floyds is famous for their progressive and psychedelic music and high-quality lyrics. This song falls under the progressive rock music genre and was the 11th song on the album 'Division Bell'.\n\nI usually listen to this song on my computer and sometimes in my MP3 player with the headphone. In fact, I am a great fan of this music band and most of their songs are on my favourite list. This song is specifically attractive for the music composition, lyrics and theme.\n\nThis song reminds the past and compares how greener and full of possibility it was. The church bell and the lyrics make an out of the world illusion that only people who love it would realise. Every time I hear this song, I can feel my childhood, the sweet memory and the greener town I used to live. This is the song that opens the horizon for me to visit my past. I love this song from my heart.\n\nThis music puts me in a sad yet charming mood. I feel sad that the past days won't be coming back and I won't have that childhood charm anymore. On the other hand, this song gives me a genuine pleasure of the memories of my childhood and all the friends and people I knew then."

    "Answer": "I have always loved listening to music – good music that is - because I consider them to be the food for my heart and mind. Anyway, while I like to listen to music from all kinds of genre, I prefer soft rock the most, and today I would like to talk about one such music which I have loved since the day I heard it for the first time.\n\nThe song, I am talking about, is titled “I Just Can't Stop Loving You” which was sung in 1987 by the legendary singer Michael Jackson.  It is actually a ballad duet of Michael Jackson and Siedah Garrett, and was the first single released from his seventh album, “Bad”. The song was written by Jackson, and co-produced by Jackson and Quincy Jones. Later, this song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, RB Singles and Adult Contemporary charts, making it the first in a string of 5 number-one single.\n\nThis song became so popular that Michael Jackson and Siedah Garrett recorded a Spanish language version of this song as well as a French version. Anyway, after listening to this song for the first time, I recorded it on audio cassette before almost 15 years ago and since then, hardly a week goes by when I don’t listen to this song at least once. This is such a piece of mild and soft music with such a great tune that every time I listen to it, I feel like I am taken to a world of dream where there is no sadness or cruelty.\n\nAnyway, this is one of my most favourite pieces of music because the lyrics in this music are so easy to understand and follow. Besides, Michael Jackson seemed to have given all his heart and musical talent in order to make this song a success story. On top of that, I also felt that he wanted to provide us with a very strong sense of heavenly appeal with this extraordinarily melodious song that he was here on earth to serve a very specific purpose, and that was to spread love instead of hatred and cruelty."

    "Answer": "In today’s world, we all need to remain updated with the latest news and events that are shaping and changing our world faster than we could ever imagine. Of course, while people choose different news sources to collect their news, depending on their needs and preferences my favourite news source is \"newspapers\".\n\nYes, I still like to consider newspapers as the most reliable source of information and news even though there are many other sources of news today. Anyway, I prefer to read newspapers because it allows me enough time to analyse a particular event or situation more thoroughly according to my own terms and understanding. Besides, it also allows me to have an argument over it within my own brain and some times with my own peers. On top of that, newspapers, unlike any other news media, provide more in-depth analysis on a subject matter which I may or may not agree. But the best think about collecting news from a newspaper is that if I don’t agree with a certain analysis or viewpoint, I can always write a letter to the editor in order to express my opinion about a piece of particular news, which is not always possible with other news media.\n\nOf course, when I say that newspapers are my favourite source of news and information, I don’t necessarily mean to suggest that I don’t rely on other sources of information. In fact, I like to watch television news also from time to time when there are some kinds of serious interviews, conversations or dialogues among the top policymakers of a country or the world. By the way, I also use the internet to get news and information from time to time.\n\nAnyway, to recap as to why newspapers are my favourite source of information, I can read the news in a newspaper according to my own pace. Besides, it also allows me the flexibility to decide what news to read what not to which may not be possible with TV news. Finally, I can carry a newspaper anywhere and read it anywhere without the need of some modern technologies like the internet or TV."

I usually turn to TV channels on a daily basis when I return home from work. I guess it is designed to hold the viewers' attention for a short period of time which seems a perfect fit for today’s fast-paced life. In the second place, it presents the most recent round-up of the news providing the opportunity for us to see and enjoy live incidents by reporters on the scene. That’s why shared viewing of TV programs can bring families together even for a while. So, I always count on TV as a handy, reliable and efficient source of news.\n\nIn fact, TV is my favourite source for news and I watch TV news almost daily. With the fast pacing life, it is often tough to totally concentrate on radio news or daily newspaper and that's why for the last few years the TV news programs are becoming more and more popular. I can turn on my TV set and there are plenty of dedicated news channels to watch. The handiest part of the TV news is that you do not have to get 100% engaged on the TV set. I can do other things at the same time the news updates get in my ear. \n \nThe audio-visual presentation, the detailed coverage and modern facilities have made the TV news really easy to grasp.

But, unfortunately, I am yet to learn to play at least one musical instrument. But, on the other hand, if there is one musical instrument that I really want to be able to play, it has to be a guitar – any kind of guitars that is.\n\nI said “any kind of guitar” above because people can be seen to be playing 3 different kinds of guitars, and they are called acoustic, electric and bass. Anyway, I am pretty sure that most of us know what a guitar looks like. But, just to refresh our memory once again, it is a type of chordophone or fretted (a long fretted neck that is) musical instrument which is traditionally made from wood and has six strings. Of course, a guitar can also have a different number of strings such as four, seven, eight or eleven.\n\nThe strings of a guitar can be made from either gut or nylon or steel. It has incurved sides, flat wooden soundboard and ribs, and a flat back. And as far as its sound is concerned, it is projected by its vibrating strings acoustically through the air. As one plucks the strings of a guitar, the wooden body of the guitar vibrates. The air inside the body vibrates too, and it's the vibrations of the wooden body and the air that amplify the string sound so we can hear it.\n\nThis musical instrument is popular among all kinds of musicians, but they are particularly popular among popular rock bands. From Willie Nelson to Bruce Springsteen and Jimi Hendrix to Joe Satriani and Richie Sambora – everybody uses guitar.\n\nAnyway, I want to be able to play the guitar because I think that it is just too much fun and exciting to be able to play some of my favourite songs. Besides, I also think that learning to play the guitar would help me become more social and friendly with other people more easily."

In my childhood, my mother once bought me a violin and I really liked this playing instrument and spent a lot of time with it. This was a simple toy that produced some demo sounds and I liked the idea of producing music with a toy. With time I got interested in other things and never had the chance or enthusiasm to learn to play the violin.\n\nBut nowadays I find this musical instrument very interesting and striking.

This instrument looks like a guitar except that the use of the bow to produce the music.    \n\nThe music yield from this instrument is very charming and produces a very soothing sound. This instrument can produce different sounds of various scales depending on how it is tuned and played. Usually, the guitar is more popular among young people in my country and the violins are played by professional musicians. Few people can actually play this instrument as I have experience and some classical and contemporary music show use this instrument while performing their music and songs.\n\nI have a fascination with this device from my childhood and I like the sound of this instrument.

    "Answer": "Life is all about adaptation and adjustment to the changing circumstances. So, we have to make numerous decisions in our life, and today, I would like to talk about one such decision which I might have to make in the future.\n\nThe decision, I might have to make in the future, is a big one because it involves a decision that is related to my career. Actually, currently, I am working as a software developer, and I have to spend a huge part of my day and time at my job. As a result, I don’t really manage to make even remotely enough time for my social life which would allow me to spend some quality time with my family and friends. On top of that, sometimes, after returning from work, I become so tired that I don’t have the energy or motivation to take care of other priorities in life.\n\nBy the way, this has been going on for almost 5 years which can be demoralizing and crippling sometimes, both physically and mentally. Of course, I have already tried to make some changes and adjustments in my life in order to minimize the negative effects of work, but nothing so far has seemed to have worked in my favour as far as a work-life balance is concerned. So, I guess, I better start to make some plans and make some decisions for a possible career change in the future before it becomes too late. Of course, the possible change would hurt me a little financially, but for the sake of my physical and mental health, I should be ready to make that little sacrifice.\n\nAnyway, it will be an important decision, primarily because I would need to learn new things and prepare my mind to deal with a new work environment. Besides, it would also significantly affect the way I think about my life and career by setting aside the old ideas and old ways of life. Finally, the decision would redefine my relationship with the people around me in a big way."

Today, I would like to talk about one of those persons who I really like to work with.\n\nHis name is Nehal Mithun. I have known Nehal for some times after he joined our company about a couple of years ago. In the beginning, of course, Nehal used to work in a different department than mine, so I didn’t really get much opportunity to learn about him, even though we occasionally talked to each other. But, after Nehal got transferred to my department, which is operations management, as a Senior Executive, I realized how great and productive of any employee Nehal really is.\n\nIn fact, I would say that Nehal is one of the most multi-talented persons I have ever met. His time management skill is impeccable since I have never really seen him failing in his deadline whether preparing a complex quarterly management report for the upper management or delivering a new product design which caters to the current market trends and consumer needs. Nehal is also equally skilled and able to boost up the morale of the staffs when the company passes through a tough time. By the way, apart from preparing reports and designing company products together at a large electronics manufacturing company, I and Nehal like to hang out together also from time to time at a café or restaurant. We also hit our favourite shopping mall to find and buy different kinds of products on discount.\n\nAnyway, I like to work so much with Nehal, primarily because he always has a natural gift to make any kinds of difficult things and situation easy. Unlike many people, Nehal always enjoys his job since he always somehow manages to bring new ideas into our work and company. Besides, I like to work with Nehal so much also because he doesn’t only enjoy his work, but also he enjoys his life whenever he gets and opportunity."

With him, all of my assignments and tasks were completed with perfect harmony and time.\n\nSince both of us work in the same office, we work for the same company but we often work on different projects. When we both are assigned to the same project, we work almost most of the office time together.\n\nIn the office, we mostly spend our time like two good colleagues and besides this, he has become a good friend of mine. We often go to a lake to have some fresh air, we go to a restaurant to have our lunch and sometimes we meet other friends. In the office, we often discuss the tasks and share our opinion on how to solve an emerging issue.\n\nI like to work with him mostly because of his pro-activeness and talent. He is a very good problem solver and always shows a professional and positive attitude to address a solution. He is a good team member and can work really hard to solve a problem. Apart from those qualities, he is a good listener and knows when to talk and when to remain silent. These are some great and exemplary qualities someone would seek from a team member and because of all these good qualities I enjoy and like to work with him."

    "Answer": "Having a great study partner or a colleague at a workplace is quite advantageous and this is why most of the people have their own preference while choosing associates in academic or professional life. As I have already finished my graduation and looking forward to having a job soon, I would like to have a great colleague or co-worker and this person would be my cousin Smith. \n\nSmith is 4 years senior to me and works for a software company as a project manager. I revere him as a great person, mentor and a creative software engineer, I would like to work with him and learn from him.\n\nI know Smith from my early childhood. He was always bright, the best scorer in school and a great companion to us. He never neglected us as juniors and had always describing rules of a new game or sports very passionately. I like him because he always treated me well. He was full of ideas and his innovative concepts wear thrilling as well as mysterious to us. From our childhood, he was an icon for us to follow. \n\nWhy would I want to work with him? Well, this is because I like him as a person and want to have a mentor like him at the beginning of my career. He excelled in programming during his university days and did exceptionally well in his professional life. Having him as a work partner would help me immensely."

    "Answer": "I like to read all kinds of books because they all teach us something in one way or another. But, if I am asked about which genre I prefer a little – again, just a little – more over the others, then I would probably have to choose “travel” related books. More specifically, I would say “travel memoir”.\n\nA travel memoir is a travel writing genre which is a delicate mixture of recollection and reflection that reveals how a journey, or a series of journeys, transformed the persons who are writing them. Some people would say that the genre of travel literature encompasses outdoor literature, guide books, nature writing, and travel memoirs.\n \nAnyway, one of the most distinct aspects of this travel genre is that almost anybody and everybody can write these types of books whether they are some travellers, military officers, missionaries, explorers, scientists, pilgrims, social and physical scientists, educators, and migrants. In other words, one doesn’t exactly need to be specially qualified to write this type of books. The definition of travel genre can be so broad that even books from adventure literature (which is a “genre” by itself) can be included in the travel genre.\n\nAnyway, when I read this kind of books, I feel like our journeys are stories of ourselves. Besides, whenever I read a book of travel literature, I feel like I am taken to distant land which I may never see or discover physically on my own, and also thus discover my own truths about what it means to be a man on this difficult, humorous and sometimes heartbreaking journey, we call life.\n\nWell, I enjoy reading this kind of books, mainly because they bring the universal philanthropic person in me who doesn’t like to differentiate among people based on race, religions and culture. Besides, I like to read this kind of books also because they introduce me to so many different cultures, lifestyles and traditions throughout the entire world, which have made our world so diversified and fascinating. This kind of books essentially takes my soul to a distant land in order to rediscover myself as a person."

    "Answer": "The history books that express the past world in front of us are kinds of books I really like. I have not read a great number of history books but I enjoyed all of the History books that I have read so far.\n\nThe history books are fact-based books that describe the events, history and significant characters from the past of human timeline. This can be simply a book that depicts the earlier civilisation of the world, can give details of the life a legendary character like Alexander or can simply explain the reasons for a great catastrophic event like the war in the past. Those events and characters come from our past history and are of great importance. Somewhere I heard that to build a good future, someone needs to learn the past. I totally agree with this statement as we have plenty of opportunities to learn from the past history of the world, our civilisations and ancestors.  \n\nThe History books that I read had helped me understanding a distant past and people of that time. History books always play an important role to educate the people about the past and I greatly enjoyed reading about our history, how the world was in the past, how different events of history had shaped the world and its geographical and political conditions. A simple event in the past had a great influence in the future and those history books bear the evidence of the past world that we have never seen.\n\nI like those kinds of books mostly because of the enthrallment I feel while learning about history. I purely enjoy learning about our world and significant events in the world. Those books are great sources of knowledge as well."

Well, as for me, I like to learn a skill because I consider it to be important, and I will tell you why I want to learn that skill.\n\nBut, first of all, let me tell you what skill I really want to learn, and the name of this skill is “fixing motorbike”. Well, I will perfectly understand if you don’t consider this skill as appealing and inspiring as many other skills, but trust me, this skill comes handy if you have a motorbike that keeps giving you trouble almost regularly.\n\nI am sure that by now, you are probably guessing that I must have a motorbike also in order for me to feel so strongly about this motorbike fixing skill, and you are right. I indeed own an old motorbike, which just likes to keep troubling me every once in a while, even though I like this old metal bird a lot. But, just because I like it a lot, it doesn’t necessarily mean that I am willing to spend tons of money every week to fix it. And so I have decided to learn this skill so that I don’t have to run to a mechanic to fix my clunky motorbike.\n\nTo do that, of course, I would need to get enrolled at a technical school first, and then I would also need to read some useful books on this subject. On top of that, watching some practical videos on this trade skill would also help a great deal.  \n\nAnyway, I want to learn this particular skill because it is important to have the needed safety and security on the road when we are driving a motorbike. Besides, I want to learn it also because it would help me save a lot of money that is spent on fixing this bike of mine since it will teach me how to fix my own motorbike."

    "Answer": "If I ever get the chance to learn a new skill, I would like to learn karate which is a form of martial art. I had a great fascination and attraction to learn it but never had the chance actually to learn it. This is important for keeping a sound body and to remain fit. It is also a great weapon of self-defence in time of adversity and sudden attack by rogue people.\n\nThe greatest benefit this karate offers is a discipline and self-control. Besides the physical exercise, patience and hard work, learning karate requires a great deal of mental power, calmness and a type of discipline which are necessary for a modest life.\n\nIf I get the chance, I would get admitted to a good karate learning training centre that would offer really good training so that I can efficiently learn it. I will need to devote a great deal of regular time and will have to have the determination to learn the necessary skill.\n\nI would like to get involved in some kind of activity which is helpful to keep the body and soul sound. Physical exercise is one way to do that but karate would be more helpful as it would require steady patience and determination as well. I have found some of my friends and relatives found it very helpful in their lives and I was inspired by their discussion regarding the usefulness of this martial art."

    "Answer": "I like to read the life stories of successful business persons in the world because they teach us a lot of things and inspire us. Today, I would like to talk about one such businessman who is not only successful in his profession but also a very renowned philanthropist.  The name of this entrepreneur and world-renowned philanthropist is “Bill Gates”.\n\nAnyway, the first time I came to learn about Bill Gates was about 20 years ago when I had just started school, and I started to learn to work on a computer. It was at that time that I learned that there was something called “Windows” which played the instrumental role in running computers, and the inventor of that thing called “Windows” was Bill Gates.\n\nBy the way, at that time, I had no clue that “Windows” was also called a computer operating system. Later on, of course, I came to know that it was that computer operating system called “Windows” which took him to the pinnacle of ultimate success and fame. Of course, the extraordinary talent of this brilliant technological mind, born in 1955, also played a huge role in becoming one of the most successful and rich persons in the world. But, apart from his fine technological mind and perfect educational background (Bill Gates attended the Harvard University), he is also a true entrepreneur in every sense because of his hard work, extraordinary ability to predict the future, and his willingness to never hold himself back from the challenge are what made Bill Gates arguably one of the most successful business persons in the last one century.\n\nAnyway, I consider Bill Gates as a successful business person, primarily because he is one of the richest persons in the world today (he also has been the richest person in the world in a row for several years). Besides, it is Bill Gates who has built the world's largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics, which indeed makes him one of the most successful business persons in modern times."

    "Answer": "Angels trumpet, more specifically Brugmansia, is a poisonous plant which is available in our country and I have seen this plant many times in different locations in my hometown. Brugmansia has large and fragrant flowers and this is the most probable reason they are called angel’s trumpets. This plant is very closely related to the genus Datura. They are either semi-woody or shrub plants with pendulous and large flowers and they do not have any spines on their fruits.\n\nThis plant can be found in tropical areas of the world and since India is a tropical country, this is found in my country as well. This plant has some medical values and alkaloids found in this plant are used to make medicines like anti-asthmatic, anticholinergic, spasmolytic, and anaesthetic. Traditional usages of this plant include the treating of pains and aches.\n\nThis plant is highly toxic and the flower can cause disorder and hallucinations. The flower and the plants part can be very dangerous for children and we need to keep away the children from putting it in their mouth.\n\nI mostly know about this plant from my childhood when the elder people prohibited us to go near this plat and strictly prohibited us from touching the flowers. Later I came to know more about this plant from a documentary and later on, I googled to find out the details of this plant. This is how I learned about this plant and its usages and toxicity."

    "Answer": "The range of plants in the plant kingdom is astounding and would surprise anyone with little interest in this subject. Some plants are carnivorous, some cure diseases while others can actually be deadly if consumed. From their ability to grow in water or on other plants to their ability to adapt to the new environment often baffle the botanists. Thank you for the topic that asks me to talk about a poisonous plant.  \n\nI have actually seen or heard about many plants that can cause allergy and itching if someone touches them and some cause diarrhoea and vomiting if consumed by any means. To me, all of these plants are poisonous if not handled with care. However, I was quite dumbfounded when I learned that tomato plant which is found in many regions of Asia and the world could be poisonous.\n\nI learned about the poisonous tomato plant accidentally when I was reading a journal called \"Journal of Plant Physiology\". Biologically tomato is a fruit but for culinary purposes, it is a vegetable. We also eat the tomato as a salad and it is almost an indispensable ingredient to prepare a salad. We use tomato in different dishes and almost every household around the globe knows this fruit.\n\nHowever, tomato leaves and stems contain solanine that is toxic if ingested, causing digestive upset and nervous excitement. If someone rubs the tomato leaf in his/her fingers, it gives a bitter odour which is because of the poisonous substance in it. Even the raw or green tomato has a small bit of toxicity, which is not deadly at all. Ripe tomatoes do not contain any detectable tomatine. Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruit, or chew plant material.\n\nThe ripe tomato, which is usually red, has a lot of advantages, it contains lycopene which is an antioxidant, which helps prevent cancer. Tomato is also a rich source of Potassium and Vitamins. It should be eaten but we should avoid consuming leaves and stems. So tomato is a plant which has poisonous foliage but a very beneficial fruit."

    "Answer": "Have you ever smelt a plan that has strong and unpleasant odour? Well, if you have, then the chances are very good that you have come across a poisonous plant. Today, I would like to talk about one such poisonous plant which is called “tobacco” or Nicotiana tabacum.\n\nInterestingly enough, even though, there are very few people in this world who don’t know about this plant, even fewer people consider this pant as poisonous because of its worldwide use for thousands of years if not more. It is from this tobacco plant that we get the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids. Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus. \n\nAnyway, even though, this tobacco plant is indigenous to the Americas, Australia, South West Africa and the South Pacific, it is actually found and grown in pretty much all over the world. However, to answer the question in which countries in the world grow it most - it would be China, followed by Brazil and India.\n\nBy the way, growing annually, this tobacco plant can grow up to 4 to 5 feet tall, with leaves up to 2 feet long.  And as for what kinds of lands are perfect for growing this plant, they grow best in places that are dry and warm. The best temperatures for growing tobacco are 68° to 86° F (20° to 30° C).\n\nThere are both advantages and disadvantages of tobacco plants. Talking about its advantages, the nicotine in this plant helps suppress appetite which means if we use tobacco, we will not gain weight. The advantage, of course, is its use can destroy our lungs and hearts.\n\nAnyway, I know about this plant by reading about it on different kinds of books, newspapers and journals. Besides, I have also learned about it from a number of TV programmes which talked about many negative effects of tobacco products, as well as the tobacco plant itself, on our health and environment."

Of course, when I say that I am prompt, I don’t mean to suggest that I take all kinds of decisions overnight, but rather I mean to say that I don’t waste any unnecessary time in making any kind of decision. But, then there comes a time in our life when we do have to take a long time to make a decision just like I did about 5 years ago.\n\nBack in 5 years, I was actually living in a nice small town while working at a branch office of one of the prestigious real estate firms in my country. After living there for almost 5 years, and trust me, 5 years is a long time, I had got very attached to that nice, little town which was beautifully adorned with many different kinds of trees, large park-like green fields full of grass and a number of small and beautiful ponds. Besides, most people there were friendly to me and treated me like one of their own even though I hailed from a different city which was far from them.\n\nSo, I liked everything about that nice little town. But, then came the order from my corporate head office, asking me to move to a different city and work there. Obviously, I didn’t like the order, so I tried to argue with my bosses that I would be more productive by working in the small city environment as I was already in. But my bosses didn’t like to hear that. So, I asked my company to allow me some time to decide whether to move or quit the job. Finally, after a month-long of deliberation with myself, I decided to move to the city as per the order of my superiors.\n\nAnyway, after making that decision, I felt that it was the right one since it was about moving forward with career.

When I had to decide between continuing my job and doing my Masters, I was so perplexed that it took more than one month to decide which one to pick. The M.Sc. program offered by the university required a student to attend the classes at day time and that contradicted my office timing. I had to pick one of these two options and my parents wanted me to finish my M.Sc. first.\n\nI felt like having a great dilemma and had to think a lot to decide. The time I spent to decide what to do took a long time mostly because I was not sure which one should I put more priority: job or study? My parents were in favour of study when some of my friends advised me to continue the job and then getting enrolled in an evening Master’s program. This dividend opinion and advice made me more confused. Another reason which caused this delay in taking the decision was the time I had in my hand. I was not bound to decide in a day or in a week since I had one month’s time in my hand to decide. I had many different thoughts at that time, and sometimes, I thought of continuing my job while another time, I thought to put more priority on my regular Master’s degree.\n\nAfter I decided to continue my job and doing the masters in a different university that offered an executive M.Sc. program, I felt like a heavy burden had fallen from my head. I talked to my parents and finally, they agreed that doing an Executive Master’s Degree would not be a bad idea. I felt great as I loved the job that I had.

After I did a promising result in my primary level, I started dreaming about studying in a really big and reputed school in the capital city. I was in a position to decide either to abandon my dream or to leave parents and siblings. I was around 10 years old at that time and could not decide which option I should pick.\n\nMy mind was oscillating and I was in a great dilemma. I did not want to leave my beloved and dearest family members but on the other hand, I could not discard my dream of getting admitted to a well-established school. It took me almost 1 year to finally decide and it was a tough decision to make for an 11-years-old boy. I planned to move to the capital city with two other classmates I had and I planned to spend all of my holidays at home.\n\nI felt good about my decision. I started feeling the necessity of reading in a good school and at the same time, I missed my family members. Initial few days were very tough for me. I got bored sometimes for being very far from my known world but that helped me to concentrate on my studies more. I chose my study as my salvation of homesickness and boredom.\n\nDeep inside my heart, I knew that I made this sacrifice at an earlier age for a greater good and someday I will get the result of my sacrifice.

I knew the country would be very different from the UK, so I thought before I started work at the University, it would help me to settle in more easily if I took a holiday in Vietnam first. So, a few weeks ago, I booked a ten-day tour with a company that would start in Hanoi and finish in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThere were 16 people on the trip including me, and there was a Vietnamese tour guide as well. I was the only British person in the group. The others were from Australia, America, Canada, Switzerland and Greece!  The tour was really good but very fast!  We often spent only one or two nights in each place. I was very lucky because we saw many beautiful places and did many interesting things. We spent time in Hanoi, Hue, Hoi An on the way to Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWe did many activities together on the tour. As well as laughing, eating and exploring together, we took trips on bicycles and on the back of motorbikes. We visited beautiful pagodas and we even went on a boat trip overnight to Halong Bay.\n\nI felt very lucky to go on this trip. It was the best holiday ever! The people I met were all really friendly and happy. None of us had visited Vietnam before, so we all enjoyed discovering this beautiful and interesting country for the first time together.

Besides, we already knew what we would do and where we would go after arriving at that place because we all knew that place well enough to make a plan for itineraries in advance.\n\nSo, as soon as we arrived there, we decided to hit the cold water and swim in it. By the way, we were visiting during the hot summertime, and we just couldn’t wait to jump into the water to cool ourselves down. To be honest, we didn’t even go to our hotel to leave our stuff and luggage before going to sea beach because we thought that it would be just a waste of time since we all were on a tight schedule.\n\nAnyway, after finishing our swimming, we went to our favourite seafood restaurant in order to enjoy some of the best seafood ever.

This beautiful artwork is also called “The Maids of Honour” or “ladies-in-waiting”. “Las Meninas” was painted by a famous artist of Spanish origin called Diego Velazquez who was court painter to King Philip IV during the early era of Spanish Baroque art (1600-1700).\n\nOriginally entitled as \"The Family of Philip IV,\" Las Meninas, painted around, 1656 depicts Velazquez himself working in his studio in Madrid's Royal Alcazar Palace. Regarded as one of the most famous and controversial artworks of all time, Las Meninas (The Maids of Honour) is widely viewed as a dialogue between artist and viewer, with its double mirror imagery and sketchy brushwork that brings every figure and object in the room to life. Then, of course, some would view it as just a scene from a play, with all the actors in their pre-planned positions, with a blond figure of a 5-year-old infant and also the daughter of King Phillip IV of Spain in the central as well as the other family members of the king. But, for the most part, this painting has been a mystery for more than three and a half centuries.\n\nAnyway, I want to have this painting at home, which would cost me about 200 US dollars to buy a duplicate one, primarily because of its mysterious nature. I also want to have it at my home because I find it to be a fascinatingly modern painting that has almost a perfect mixture of realism and non-realism (and the opinion is coming from a layman person like me who has almost no or very little idea about artworks)."

And the reason for this was that, unlike today, using a phone to communicate with others in the past was a bit more on the expensive side. So, basically, I would need to seek permission from my parents before using that land phone to communicate with my friends and relatives. But, that was all when I still was a boy, and I didn’t have any mobile or smartphone. Now that I have my smartphone (and before having a smartphone, I used to own a nice, little regular mobile phone), I can use it to communicate with the others at will whether they are living inside the country or outside of it.\n\nBy the way, just so we are all on the same page when I say that my favourite way to communicate with others is a phone, I mean to say that I like to talk over the phone (as in making a voice call) as opposed to using text SMS or voice mails. Anyway, I have been using this method of communication for the last 20 years or so.\n\nNow, why I prefer this particular method of communication? Well, my answer would be that it is just so easy, convenient and cheap. Besides, when I use a phone and voice call to communicate with others, I feel like I am in more control of the narratives of the message which I really want to communicate with the others. Finally, I prefer it also because I just like to talk a bit more than the others."

    "Answer": "We usually communicate with others in several ways and these communication ways differ based on the person we are communicating and our convenience of communication devices. For instance, we usually communicate via email with our clients and co-workers while we prefer using a mobile phone to communicate with our friends of family members.\n\nMy favourite way of communication is calling someone on their mobile phone. This is mostly because, it is cheaper, easy to use, easily accessible, movable, easily fit in the bags and pockets, could be used for using the internet and other necessary applications, cheaper call rate and offer effective communication.\n\nI have a personal mobile phone and when someone calls me, I can see the information of the caller and receive the phone using the touch or tap in a button. After the conversation is done, I just need to put the phone in the pocket. This is as simple as that. Whenever I want to call someone, I just need to dial his/ her number and after s/he receives the call, the connection is on. Besides the calling, someone can easily send and receive texts on the phones which also serve a good way of communicating others. I own a cell phone for more than 10 years and I find it very convenient for communication on personal and official matters.\n\nThere are several reasons why I prefer this way of communication. First of all, it is easy to carry and we can take it wherever we go. The calling rates are very cheap nowadays and we can refill the credit of our cell phones very easily. Calling locally and internationally both are supported and hence I prefer to have it as my primary way of communication. Phone calls reach the recipient instantly unlike mail and email and this is why this is a very efficient way of communication when we need to reach someone urgently."

    "Answer": "This is an interesting topic because I am not really that much familiar with the animals, living in water except only with a few, even though I live in a country which has many lakes, rivers and ponds all over. Anyway, the few animals, living in water, I know about are crocodiles, whales, seals and dolphins, and today I would like to talk about crocodiles.\n\nWell, I have been familiar with this fascinating animal called crocodile since the days of my early childhood when I started to attend elementary school and learn about all the beautiful and exotic animals in the world.\n\nBut, I found crocodiles to be a bit special when I learned that crocodiles are one of the only animals that are thought to have survived the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaur population almost 250 million of years ago. They survived the mass extinction and thrived for hundreds of millions of years to come. Therefore, it’s safe to say, their history on earth is a long and mysterious one!\n\nLater on, as I grew up older, I came to learn a lot more about these large aquatic reptiles after watching many TV programmes on the animal kingdom of the world. Then, I must also mention about revered Australian legends like Crocodile Dundee, Paul Hogan, and the legendary Steve Irwin (the architect of the TV programme called “crocodile hunter”) whose adventurous, sometimes very dangerous, works under the water made waters animals like crocodile really interesting to me. By the way, I wouldn’t really say that the crocodile is a common animal in the country where I live, but they can be seen once in a while.\n\nAnyway, crocodiles are large reptile animals which live in freshwater, lakes, rivers, brackish water (a mix between salty and freshwater). They can be anywhere between 5 to 18 feet long and 40 pounds to 2000 pounds, depending on which part of the world they live in. The skin of these meat-eating animals is highly appreciated in the fashion industry and represents a status symbol for wealthy people. Finally, crocodiles can live from 50 to 80 years."

    "Answer": "The whale is an interesting animal that lives in the water and it is the largest animal among the living creatures in the world. Whales usually inhabit in the oceans all around the world and the size varies from 80 to 150 feet. They usually have a lifespan of an average 77 years and some whales live over a century.\n\nI have heard about this large water animal in one of my textbooks when I was in kindergarten and later I have seen this animal and their characteristics on different TV channels. No, this is not a common water animal in our country. In fact, fishes are the most common water animal in our country and very few whales could be found in the ocean in our country.\n\nThis is the largest known animal in the animal kingdom which lives in water and is known as marine mammal animal. The average whales can be 30 meters long and they can have more than 180 tonnes weight. They are long-lived animals and some whales live over 100 years. Whales breathe air, like other mammals, and they are warm-blooded, feed milk to their infants and have body hair.\n\nThe whale is considered to be an animal that learns, teaches, cooperates and even grieves like other mammal animals. Whales can make extremely loud sounds which are known as whale songs and these sounds are their communication media. It is generally considered that whales are predators but they also eat various other foods like plankton and other animals. Whales that have teeth often eat fish and squid which they mostly hunt using the echolocation."

    "Answer": "I am one of those persons who put more emphasizes on the weather and the mood in choosing dresses instead of any occasions whether they are special or not. But, I think, there is one particular type of dresses which I like to wear more than the others on special occasions, so I will go ahead and talk about that dress here.\n\nThe dress, I like to wear on most occasions, is a white or yellow shirt in half-sleeve. And to go with it, I also like to wear pants, preferably black or navy blue, and black or brown dress shoes. Of course, before I wear them, I want to make sure that my shirts and pants are nicely ironed and spotlessly cleaned. Besides, I also want all of my clothes to be made from purely cotton fabric even though, these days, it is really difficult to get them.\n\nBy the way, I like to wear this particular type of dress in all kinds of weather, unless it is really cold, and to all types of special occasions whether I am attending a wedding ceremony, birthday party, formal meeting, graduation ceremonies, family reunion party or religious ceremonies. Besides, I also like to wear this particular dress when I am attending any formal dinner party whether it is at a restaurant or at home. So, really, the choices are limitless as far as the question of on what occasions, I like to wear this dress.\n\nI think that many other people also like to wear this particular dress on different kinds of special occasions.\n\nWell, I like to wear this particular dress, primarily because they look really classy and elegant on me because of my complexion and physical structure. I like to wear this particular dress also because they are lightweight and don’t really stick with my body in an uncomfortable way. Finally, I like to wear them because they don’t really look worn out or shine-less, no matter how long I wear them for, or how roughly I use them. All in all, it is a good dress to wear."

    "Answer": "The type of dress I wear on special occasions mostly depends on the occasion types and the custom of dresses people usually wears on those occasions. However, for the majority of these special occasions, I like to wear formal pants, shirts, suits and formal shoes.\n\nI usually wear it to participate in any meeting, social pragmas like the wedding ceremony, birthday celebration, official a program arranged by a relative. Yes, this is a common dress that many other people wear on those sorts of occasions. But some people wear different dresses as well. The teenagers who attend social programs usually wear jeans and t-shirts but the adults mostly wear this dress.\n\nThis dress code is a safe one to wear. First of all this dress matches the weather all around the year in my country. Secondly, this is a dress which is safe to wear as people won’t criticise people who usually wear this dress on special occasions. This dress does not catch much attention and would give the impression that the person is rightly dressed."

    "Answer": "This is such an interesting topic since I do like to analyse different characters in different movies, every time I watch a movie, just for the sake of having an argument or discussion with my friends over a cup of tea. Today, I would like to talk about one such character from a movie which I think is interesting.\n\nThe character, I would like to talk about, is “Forrest Gump” from “Forrest Gump” movie. So, as you can see, the movie name has been derived from this main character called Forrest Gump which is played by Hollywood actor Tom Hanks.\n\nIn this movie, Forrest Gump is featured in the whole movie, from start to finish, where he is shown to be a person with low IQ and joining the army. However, even though, he is a very simple-minded man, he goes on to live a life which is full of adventures. But, no matter, how adventurous of a life he lives, he just can’t forget about his school time sweetheart – a troubled girl who becomes very sick with some unknown but terminal illness. But, in spite of knowing all these things, Forrest Gump marries her, only to see her dying just after six months of their marriage.\n\nAnyway, I think the character Forrest Gump performed superbly since it very successfully keeps us anticipating about what is going to happen in the next moment as we keep watching the movie. The way the character talks, runs and deals with his life – all seem to be so natural.\n\nAnyway, I admire this character because it goes to show very nicely that just because someone doesn’t seem to be as “smart” as others, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he or she won’t be able to live or enjoy his life. Besides, it also successfully manages to portray himself as a “fighter” even though people around him are so full of negativities. Finally, I admire this character also because it beautifully reveals the loving and touching details of human life, as well as the sense of belongingness, without which, it is very difficult to find our life worth living."

    "Answer": "’Vito Corleone’ the legendary character created by the acclaimed author Mario Puzo in the Godfather movie is a character I really liked. This is a fictitious character from a book of the same title, ‘The Godfather”, and this was a very successful character of the movie industry.\n\n‘Vito Corleone’ was listed as the greatest movie character in history by the Premier Magazine and it is also considered to be one of the best 10 greatest characters in the movie by the Empire magazine. In fact, this is a character none would forget if he enjoys The Godfather movie. This character was performed by Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro (earlier stage of Don’s life). Vito Corleone was the mafia head of the Corleone mafia family of New York City who was migrated from Sicily.  \n\nThe acting was superb and throughout the movie, he had been successful to create an image that people will remember always. His acting was so profound that many people imagine a mafia don based on the character he has performed. I enjoyed the sequels of The Godfather movie and was deeply touched by the life of the mafia don himself. The perfect acting, the dialogues and the influences the character had is simply impeccable and depicts the story perfectly. This is the reason I still believe that the ‘Vito Corleone’ is one of the greatest characters in movie history."

    "Answer": "Sometimes, I envy him and then think about how possibly he can be so happy in life. I even ask him about the secret to his peace, but he doesn’t answer. Instead, he just simply laughs away, which sometimes leads me to believe that there is perhaps no secret to happiness.\n\nWell, the person, I envy, is none other than one of my best childhood friends who I have known for about 20 years since the days we were going to high school. Yes, he is indeed one of the happiest persons I have ever seen in my life who thinks that being happy and remaining happy is a very easy thing to do. And perhaps, that’s why he can always put a smile on his face, no matter what the circumstances are.\n\nBut, he doesn’t exactly express his happiness in the same way. For example, if he hears a piece of good news from anybody, he thanks him or her after giving the person a lot of good advice charmingly and convincingly. In fact, he talks to the good news bearer in such a way that the person becomes the more important person than the news he or she is delivering. He also likes to express his happiness by giving gifts, be them small or big, to his families and friends alike even when there are no occasions for it. Besides, when he feels happy, he also becomes very animated sometime either by laughing out loudly or jumping in the air. His happiness is expressed also in the way he always talks to other people in a very positive and inspiring manner.\n\nAnyway, I consider him to be the happiest person, primarily because I have never seen him with a sad face. Besides, if a person tries to find happiness in every little thing in the world, there is no other option but to consider him as a very happy and positive person. Finally, I consider him to be a very, very happy person because I have never seen him getting mad at another person even when there is a reason for him to be angry."

However, if we spend a great deal of time with someone and if we can observe him/ her closely, then we can make a very good assumption of his characteristics and his ideas.\n\nI would pick my friend (…say the name of a friend…) to be the happiest person I have ever met or seen. He is my friend from early childhood and in my opinion, he knows the value of being happy and no matter what happens, he is contented and that makes him happy.\n\nI first met him in my high school and both of us used to do take part in debate competition together. Thus the closeness and friendship grew between us and later on our friendship grew even further when we got admitted to the same university.\n\nHe has a positive attitude and he is very contented with whatever he has. That’s the attitude and positive thinking which make him happy. He does not repent for thinks undone or bad things that happened to him. I heard him saying that life is hard and you can be happy if you are happy in your mind. That’s something I agree and I have found him to be happy in his mind even from the worst experience.\n\nHe always smiles and never regrets the things undone like others. He feels that happiness is inside us and our positive attitude can make us happy. He has a positive attitude of removing the negativity of life. He loves to enjoy the fuller possibility of life and he has a charismatic character to make his friends happy.\n\nFor the positive mentality he possesses and the happy behaviours he shows always make me consider him to be the happiest person I have ever known."

His name is Christopher (... or say a name you like...) and I consider him to be happy and jolly all the time. Since he is still very young and has a very positive mentality, he is indeed a happy person.\n\nWe live in a joint family and my nephew Christopher was born in our house. In fact, I know him from his early days. I know him for the last 12 years as I have seen him grown up in from of me. It is amazing that he has turned to be a 12-years young boy but to me, it seems like he is still a child.\n\nThe complexities of life have not touched him yet. He inherited the positive attitude from his father who always tries to be in a good and positive mood no matter what. As twelve years old boy, my nephew is still very innocent. He possesses a positive and good mentality and that helps him to be a happy person. He does not seek for luxury and tries to be contended with whatever he has and that's a great weapon to lead a happy life. He is physically strong, plays outdoor games and does not foster anxiety. He tries to find happiness even in his time of trouble and for all those positive mentality and behaviours he has taken life as a pleasant and meaningful journey.\n\nHe is happy because he is mentally satisfied and contended. Happiness is pretty tough to define but it is sure that it is a state of positive and contented mind and my nephew Christopher has it all."

While the books are written on an array of subjects, I particularly like the ones that talk about promoting better understanding among people from different cultures, race and religions, and today I would like to talk about one such book.\n\nThe book, I am talking about, is titled “Islam between East and West” which is written by a Bosnian politician, lawyer and author called Alija Izetbegovic. Even though, he hasn’t written that many books, I like to consider the author of this book as one of the most brilliant religious philosophers of 20th century because of his deep and extraordinary understanding of our world’s two main religions - Islam and Christianity.\n\nAnyway, the books, which I bought from a local library at my hometown, talks about dealing with dogmas, institutionalism and teachings of Islam with the aim of establishing the place of Islam in the general spectrum of ideas. It is a book at Islam not from within but rather from without. In this sense, the topic of the book is not primarily Islam as a teacher but Islam as an outlook on the world. However, while trying to talk about the Islamic conception of the world, he has also tried to talk about the core doctrines of atheism, socialism and Christianity in order to place Islam on its true and natural course. This book conducts a comparative analysis of modern materialist ideologies with religious thought by talking about the effects of “pure religion” and “pure materialism”.\n\nAnyway, I have kept this great book at my home, primarily because I read it from time to time to enhance my understanding of the unchecked greed of our material world. Besides, I also like to take the references from this book when I try to have some intelligent conversations with my friends. Finally, I have kept this book also because I really like its author, not only as one of the most renowned philosophers of the 20th century but also as an accomplishing politician."

The back cover has a critical review of the book and other details of the publisher and printing details. The book is a Socratic dialogue, written by Plato around 380 BC and this was concerning the definition and implementation of justice. This book is considered to be Plato's best work and it has proven throughout the ages to be one of the most intellectually, influential and historically important works of philosophy as well as political theory. The book also discusses the immortality of the soul, the theory of forms, the roles of the philosopher, the social structure, justice and its intricacies and poetry in society.\n\nThis was a book bought by my father as I have seen it from my early childhood. The binding and papers of the book were so good that the book still seems in new condition. I have read it once and thoroughly enjoyed the content of it. This book has amazed me and had opened lots of thought-provoking topics in front of me.\n\nThis book was bought by my father and it is one of his most favourite books.

One such pen pal, I had from Malaysia, had sent me a beautiful postcard. But, I was so impressed with the look of that postcard that eventually I made it one of my most favourite hobbies to collect them.\n\nYes, I am just hooked to collecting postcards (some would like to call them “view cards” as well) from all over the world. Oh, in case if you were wondering about what a postcard or view card really is, it is a rectangular piece of thick paper or thin cardboard, typically having a photograph or other illustration on one side, which is intended for writing and mailing without an envelope.\n\nOf course, these postcards can have non-rectangular shapes as well. But, what their sizes really are, I consider them to be some of the coolest things in this world because of the rare historical and emotional values. Anyway, in the last 20 years or so, I have collected so many postcards from all eras, countries and cultures, and have tried to organize and store them as best as I can. But, most of them are kept in large picture albums since that’s where they can maintain their original looks. Then, I have kept some of them in a few large boxes as well since they didn’t really fit in a picture album that well because of their varied sizes.\n\nAnyway, I enjoy collecting the postcards, primarily because they offer me a perfect glimpse of the past which otherwise couldn’t be captured. Besides, they also help me understand the cultures, lifestyles and traditions of people around the world who I probably would never be able to meet. Finally, I like to collect them because they bring so many famous and beautiful landscape and natural sceneries of the world into light. In fact, I would probably never know that our world is such a beautiful place if I didn’t see these postcards."

And that one thing is watching old and classic movies from all around the world.\n\nNow, I am not sure how many people in this world has this hobby of watching old and classic movies, but I am assuming that they must be quite a significant number since many movie clubs have the collections of so many old days movies. In other words, if there were no demands for these old and classic movies, the movie clubs wouldn’t exactly have so many of them in their collection. But, luckily, when it comes to my elder brother, he doesn’t really have to join a movie club or anything to watch his favourite movies, instead, all he does is to visit some video stores in his town and pick up some random old movies whichever fits his taste. In return, of course, the video store owners charge him some extra money since these old and classic movies aren’t always easy to find, but my elder brother doesn’t really mind that extra charge.\n\nBy the way, my eldest brother isn’t exactly a very technical person. Moreover, downloading illegal copies movie from the internet isn’t exactly something he would be doing. Of course, sometimes I download a few of them. Now, I am not sure how many old movies my eldest brother really has in his collection, but by looking at the stacks of videos, CDs and DVDs anyone would think that they must be quite a few hundred.\n\nAnyway, I am really happy and glad for my eldest brother because of this hobby of his, but I don’t really think that I would enjoy it even a fraction of how much my brother does. And, the reason for this is that I like to watch mostly new movies. To me, except for some really good classic old movies, most old moves are just for old people, and I am no old person.

    "Answer": "I like to consider myself as a smart and confident person, and as such, I have always maintained that I don’t really need to consult or discuss anything with other people. And then, I had this important conversation one day with my elder uncle who basically hinted that I was probably a bit too smart and confident for my own good! Here is how the story goes:\n\nAbout a couple of years ago, I started to believe that I could do some kind of lucrative business even after doing a full-time job. Of course, I had my reasons to think like that since I saw that one of my university friends was doing just that. In fact, he wasn’t only having his full-time job and a part-time business, but also becoming a successful entrepreneur within a rather short period of time. So, I got all set and ready to start my part-time business of making bread and cakes after having a little conversation with my parents.\n\nBut, then came the dreaded summon from my elder uncle who I always tried to avoid because of his straight and practical talks. Anyway, I reluctantly agreed to discuss the matter with my uncle, and after learning everything about my plan and ambition, he told me in a very fatherly and loving tone that I should never put our both legs on two boats because that would make us lose our balance sooner or later. He also told me that being successful in business required a huge patient, apart from a reasonable amount of capital and hard work, which I didn’t have. Needless to say, after having the conversation, I gave up the idea of starting my part-time business.\n\nAnyway, I considered this conversation to be important because it taught me two things. First thing was that being over-smart and over-confident is not always a recipe for success but also can be a recipe for disaster. Second thing was that we always need to find out our weaknesses before relying on our strengths. Some great and powerful lessons indeed!"

He also talked about some of our national events that have changed the world and have significant historical impacts and importance.

    "Answer": "I have wanted to buy many things since the time I started to understand the world around me little by little. Of course, with the passage of time, I have given up the idea of buying many of those things too. But, one particular idea, which has never evaded the radar of my mind, is the idea of buying a new car.\n\nEven though I am not sure what exactly drove me to the idea of buying a car in the first place, but when I saw it for the first time as a kid, I was absolutely impressed with its look and presence. And, then when I rode in it for the first time (as a kid also), I knew that this thing called “car” must have meant something very special for the people who owned them. But, now that I am old, I understand it very well that it is a special household item in these modern days and times.\n\nSo, why I want to buy a car? Well, when I was a kid, I wanted to buy it solely because I thought that it was just so “cool” to ride in it. But, as time passed, I felt that I wanted to buy it because this four-wheel-drive would offer me the freedom, convenience and peace of mind to travel as I wish. I want to buy a car also because it would allow me to save a lot of time.  But, I think that the most important reason, for which, I have always wanted to buy a car for the last 18 years of my life is that it would give me the confidence and drive to be a more successful person both personally and professionally.\n\nAnyway, once I buy my car, I would take it to visit my friends and families and then take them to some beautiful places so that we can spend some quality time together. Then, of course, I would also drive on the road to go as far as it can take just to have the “cool” feeling and speed which I felt as a kid."

    "Answer": "I have always wanted to buy a flat near a lake and open space. My father has his own home where I used to live until I had to move to a new city for my job. Currently. I am living in a rented house in the metropolitan city for my job and yet I have a great desire to own a house of my own that would be a large house with lots of rooms and which would be near a lake or river.\n\nI have wanted to buy this house most probably after I moved to the new city where I am currently residing. I wanted a house of my own where I would have my family members and that would give me the freedom of living. The house would be near open space and close to nature. It is almost impossible to have such a house in the metropolitan city I am currently living in. I have the plan to return to my hometown, buy this house and then start a business of my own.\n\nI will have the house decorated and arranged in the way I have always wanted. I will have my family members to move to this house. I will keep an open space in front of this house and I will grow many plants and flowers in this open space."

    "Answer": "I love to read newspapers on a regular basis, not only because it allows me to remain updated with the latest news, but also because it allows me to read some informative and interesting articles on various important issues. Talking about articles, of course, I would like to talk about one of them which I have recently read.\n\nThe article talked about how my country would be able to meet the housing demands of the ever-increasing population of my country without causing deforestation and waste of cultivable land. Of course, I had read such articles in the past, but none of those really went on to describe the crisis and its solution in as details as this particular article which just read about a couple of weeks ago in one of the popular daily newspapers of my country.\n\nAnyway, the article went to describing in details as to how rapidly our population has increased over the last 50 years or so, and yet no concrete and timely-policy has been adopted to deal with this problem. And, as a result, as the article put it, if this trend continues, our country won’t have enough land to produce necessary food for its population soon as more and more lands are being used to build houses and other infrastructures in a very unplanned manner. At the end of the article, the author of the article tried to provide some pragmatic solutions to the housing crisis of our country by providing enough raw data and evidence. Needless to say, I read the article a few times just to understand the danger and challenges that lie ahead of my country if we are not serious enough about this problem.\n\nAnyway, after reading the article, the first thing that came to my mind was that our government needed some concerted efforts to come up with new and innovative ideas in building efficient houses without wasting too much land. Besides, I also felt that until some practical housing policies are in place, the newspapers and other media outlets should publish such articles more often to raise awareness among the people."

    "Answer": "I usually read a newspaper daily and I also enjoy reading some technology and lifestyle related magazines. There are lots of interesting, thought-provoking and intriguing articles that I often enjoy and today I would like to talk about one such article that I recently read from a newspaper.\n\nIt was about 'the global warming & the environment changes' and how the humankind has contributed to this damage and finally, how to prevent it. This is not a new topic but the article I am talking about was written from a different perspective. It highlighted that changes that happened in the last decade and how these changes have already impacted our environment and life. I read this article 2-3 weeks ago and this was written by a famous environmental scientist and researchers.\n\nI am a bit confused whether should I say it as a piece of bad news or good news since this is a research and statistical fact type article that showed the environmental changes in recent years, temperature rise all around the world, the impact of it in our lives and in other species, then it showed our ignorance about the severity of this danger and then finally some solutions to mitigate the problem. The first few parts were like bad news as they described how much we have already damaged the environment but the final part of the news/ article showed the light of hope and explained that we still have the opportunity to save ourselves from the disaster. Some of the solutions were proposed and that I consider being good news.\n\nI have read numerous articles about the ozone layer, extinction of some species in the recent years, then the danger of health for the pollution and many more similar topics but this one was written in a different viewpoint and tried to explain that small changes in our perception and daily habit can save a lot. This article alerted us and then showed us our lack of awareness of the issue and then gave the hope of making positive changes. I felt like I have adopted a different perception of this triggering issue and felt the need to read more on the topic. The news helped me understand our immediate attention to a dire issue and how each of us can contribute to reducing the severity of this eminent problem."

    "Answer": "I still remember the day when I took an educational trip for the first time as a student of 9th grade. Not to mention, of course, I was very much interested to take part in it as we, together with 50 students from my high school, were going to be taken to one of the biggest zoos of my country.\n\nIf I remember it correctly, 4 or 5 teachers visited with us in order to coordinate and supervise the trip.\n\nWe started our journey at around 8 a.m. in the morning in a big rented bus. Even though it was a significantly long trip of almost 4 hours, we all felt like we arrived at the zoo soon because the trip itself was very much enjoyable for us. In fact, we all were signing in a chorus and cracking jokes at each other. Anyway, after arriving at the zoo, our teachers made us all stand in the line with a ticket in each of our hands and asked us to enter the zoo one by one in an orderly fashion even though we just couldn’t wait to enter in it as quickly as we could.\n\nAnd then, we all finally entered inside the zoo, we could see all kinds of animals from such close proximity. Tigers, deer, elephants, cheetahs, rhinos, zebras, waterbucks, otters, hyenas, giraffes, impala, black bears, tapirs, hippos, lions as well many species of monkeys, chimpanzees, baboons. I also saw crocodiles, peacocks along with other birds like Sarus crane and pond heron. We all took our pictures with some of those beautiful animals. We even offered them some foods (with permission from the zoo authority) and the animals were so happy to eat them.\n\nAnyway, the trip was important for me because it taught me about many unknown things about how some of the animals, which we don’t see in our day to day life, actually live. Besides, it also taught me how the presence of these animals around us help preserve our environment and ecosystem around us, without which our earth would be a dangerous place to live in."

    "Answer": "When I was in class six, the school authority arranged an educational tour in the city botanical garden. I was very much interested to participate in it and after I got my parent’s permission, I enrolled in the trip. It was a trip to the largest botanical garden called (…say a name…) and we were almost 30 students and 5-6 teachers in the trip.\n\nAfter we reached the garden I was very much enthralled to watch such a beautiful place that seemed very green and different from the place we lived. The journey took 3-4 hours and I enjoyed my visit a lot. The place very large and there were several thousands of trees, some hills, lakes etc. the large trees gave us the impression of the woods and I felt like we came to visit a large woods of mediaeval age. The teachers introduced us with several plants and flowers and there were many plants and flowers that I read or heard about but have never seen before that day.\n\nWe learned about the importance of forests, the necessity and our responsibility to make the world a better place for all the species and not just for humans only. We learned some medical and herbal aspects of many trees and one of the teachers explained how the plants and their ingredients are still used to make life-saving medicines. The whole trip was educational and enjoyable as well.\n\nThis was a very important trip for me as I had the scope to visit such a beautiful place surrounded by green trees and flowers. I learned many things about the plants and their usefulness. I also learned about the natural equilibrium and why should we maintain a greener environment for our own betterment."

    "Answer": "I went on several educational excursions and tours both as a high school student as well as a junior college student.  Not to mention, all of those excursions were both educational and fun. But, the one, I am about to talk today, was more than just educational and fun.\n\nThe excursion, I am talking about, took place about 15 years from now when I was a final year junior college student. By the way, up and until then, I never really thought of visiting a museum nor did I ever get an opportunity to visit one. So, naturally, when our college supervisor told us one day that we were going to visit our “Liberation War Museum”, I felt a bit excited.\n\nSo, one day, together with 30 students from our class and 3 teachers, we hit the road to visit the liberation war museum in the capital city of our country. It was a long 3-hour journey, but it felt like only an hour or so because we were really enjoying our bus ride.\n\nAnyway, after reaching the museum, the museum tour guide gave us an interesting tour. As we were walking in the museum, we saw some rare pictures of our liberation war. In some of these pictures, our brave soldiers and guerrilla fighters were seen to fighting in the battlefields. Apart from those, we also saw a collection of many more objects which included documents, coverage in both electronic and print media and materials used by freedom fighters and martyrs of the Liberation War, in addition to many of the personal belongings of some of our legendary political leaders who actually organised the liberation war of our country close to a century ago.\n\nAnyway, I really liked the excursion, mainly because it taught me some important things, such as the magnitude of human sacrifice and destruction, which are always needed to give birth to a new nation. Besides, I also liked the tour also because it allowed me to learn about many unknown facts of our historical existence as a nation."

    "Answer": "I went on many excursions and study tours from my college and university and the tour I would like to talk about I took in 2004 when I was a college student. The college notice board one day declared that there would be an educational tour to the central museum and the interested persons are invited to place application form and money to the authority.\n\nI was interested and when I found that my close friends from the college would also go, I asked my father for permission to take part in the excursion. On the day, I went to the college ground and found that other students and teachers have already gathered there. The bus left at 7:30 am and we reached the museum at around12:00 pm. Though many of my friends already went to the central museum, I never went there before the study tour of our college.\n\nI enjoyed everything I watched there and our history teacher was explaining many of the things preserved in the museum. That day I realised how exciting the study tour can be. It gives both the opportunity to learn and enjoy.\n\nWe took our lunch in the museum canteen with the foods we took with us and in the evening we returned to our hometown approximately at midnight. I learned about the past history of our country, some of the old customs and practice we had in our country, several significant evidence of the history and the life and work of famous people of our country.\n\nActually I enjoyed the tour very much and as a result, I still remember it. This time I learned that there are some other ways of learning things apart from attending classes. The excursion was so interesting to me that I planned to travel extensively in my life on that very day."

    "Answer": "Well, in my humble opinion, childhood memories are probably some of the best things that we cherish the most as adults. As a child, I also have some memories, some of which are purely funny and entertaining while the others are plain naughty. Today, I would like to talk about one of those naughty things which I did when I was only probably 9 years old.\n\nAnyway, when I was a child, I loved to play all kinds of sports except, of course, the only problem was that I wasn’t really any good or expert in any of those games. But, still, I kept playing those games because I was an outgoing child, and I always loved to hang out with my friends. So, one day, when I was playing football (soccer) with my friends, I was forced to play as a goalkeeper. Not to mention, of course, I never liked being a goalkeeper, but just because I wasn’t really good at playing in any other positions in a regular football match, my only natural position in the team was to play as a goalkeeper.\n\nOf course, I had played as a goalkeeper in the past, but on that occasion, I just told myself that I won’t play as a goalkeeper anymore. So, I made a naughty plan, and the plan was to not become serious about blocking the ball from the opposition team whenever it would be hit towards the goalpost at me. Not to mention, as I kept leaving the ball, headed towards our goalpost, cleverly one after another, my team had no other options but to digest one “goal” after another.  Apparently, my plan had worked as my friends and the team never asked me to play as a goalkeeper anymore after that day.\n\nAnyway, as I feel about this naughty thing today, I couldn’t actually quite believe that I could be so clever and naughty! Besides, I also feel like an apology is due to my friends who had to digest so many “goals” because of the naughty me."

    "Answer": "Childhood is magical and we remember our childhood with great joy. Even the stupid things we have done in our childhood seems very exciting to us in our later life. The naughty things that I did in my childhood are many and I will mention a particular thing that I did when I was only 7 years old. I was in grade two at that time and one day on my way to the school I found that some of my classmates have gathered near a pond and they have planned to catch fish from that pond. I forgot about my school and put the school bag in a nearby tree. I was very excited about the whole idea of catching fish and then cooking it for dinner.\n\nI stayed for around 3-4 hours to catch the fish with my bare hand and with some small nets my classmates had with them. After 2-3 hours I was tired and was convinced that it was not an easy job to do. I found that my classmates had become less interested in it by this time and they were planning to go home.\n\nBy the time I realised that I have done a great mistake by skipping school and I have made my dresses dirty in the pond, it was too late. I was afraid that my mother would be very angry if she finds out what I really did over here. Then I talked with my classmates and found that they got anxious as well. We were 3-4 in number and only one of us had been able to catch 2 small fishes. We then made a decision to steal some fishes from the other people who had already caught a good number of fishes and put them in their jars.\n\nWe had been successful to steal some fishes from others and when I returned home, I had 3-4 fishes in my bag. I was lucky to get over with the things I had done and I still find it very funny and naughty thing to do in my childhood. I have done many other naughty things later part of my life but this was the event that still gives me real pleasure to think about."

    "Answer": "Well, this is an interesting topic and I can recall many such naughty events from my childhood. I would, however, like to talk about an event when I went to visit the Local Museum with two of my friends.\n\nI was about 9 years old and was in grade three. One day our school was declared off for some unknown reason just after an hour it started. That was a pleasant surprise and a great joy for us. Instead of returning home, I planned to go somewhere with two of my friends. One of the friends suggested that the Local Museum would be worth visiting a place and we should go there. Without thinking much, we rushed to the nearby bus station and took a local bus to reach the city centre where the museum was located. We gathered all the coins and money we had with us and bought three tickets for the museum. Luckily we got a 50% discount as students but we had to lie to the ticket seller and the guard that we went there with one of our uncles who was inside the museum. The guard had his suspicion but did not bother much. We entered inside the museum and spent almost three hours when all of a sudden I noticed that my father with a police officer and a museum guard was walking toward us. I just froze in fear and then noticed that my friends' parents were also there.\n\nThat was a devastating moment for me and I found that two of my friends froze green in fear and tension. My father came to me, grabbed my hand and asked me whether I had eaten anything during lunch or not. He also told me that my mum was worried about my whereabouts. That was quite surprising for me but not unusual for my father to behave very calmly when others lose their tempers. I found that one of my friends was already being rebuked by his father. However, my father is a great dad and quite different from other dads. He took me to a nearby restaurant and ordered lunch for me as if we went there for a celebration. He told me that my mother was so anxious and we should return home quickly. He also told me that he cannot guarantee whether my mother would become furious or would remain clam after I return home. I was happy that my father had already understood what we did and he asked me to promise that I would never do such thing ever again. I promised and then realised what my father had to do to find me. He had to left his office, assure my mother, visit my school, talk to people and then search everywhere. I was quite curious to know how he found us but did not dare to ask. It must have already been a great deal of effort and anxiety for my parents. I was feeling ashamed at that moment and promised to myself not to do such a thing ever again without the permission of my parents.\n\nIt took many years for me to find that it was a great moment and quite a naughty thing to do as a grade three student. I do not feel much ashamed for this event now as this was my first visit to any museum. My first visit to the museum has become a great memory for me. As childhood is full of unexpected events and most of those later become memorable and cherished part of our childhood, this was such an event when I did a naughty and unexpected thing."

    "Answer": "I think that most people in this world like to enjoy foods, especially, if they are prepared in a special manner. Today, I would like to talk about one such special meal which I remember having with my friends about a few months ago.\n\nAnyway, I like pizza – all kinds of pizza – whether they are made with meats or vegetables. So, what makes pizza so special apart from their awesome taste? Well, for those who don’t like to eat pizza, the way a pizza is made, the efforts needed to make it and the texture of this round-shaped food – all make it very special from start to finish.\n\nNo wonder that I travel miles to eat this special food just like I travelled on that occasion with my friends to a very popular Italian restaurant in my hometown. By the way, I had visited this particular restaurant many times in the past, and so, I was a familiar face to most of the staffs there. So, when I and my friends asked the manager of that restaurant to add some extra ingredients, apart from the regular pizza items, he gladly decided to oblige.\n\nWe also told the manager to share our pizza with the rest of the customers in his restaurant in order to collect their opinions about the new taste of our pizza. The manager agreed to our second request as well. Finally, the pizzas were served with some specially made fruit salad on the side. Initially, we were a bit sceptical about the taste of our pizzas, but when we actually tried them, they tasted remarkable.  \n\nAnyway, we all felt that our pizza meal was special, primarily because we had them prepared in a different way with different kinds of ingredients. Needless to say, it was a special meal also because it just didn’t taste great but also unique. Finally, it was a special meal because it allowed all of my friends to get together after a long time and have some great time in a very friendly environment."

The meal was thrown as part of the farewell of our batch from the high school. The party was help in the evening and our teachers, classmates and some of the members of the school committee as well as our guardians were present. My father was present with me and he was sitting next to me in the meal.\n\nThis was a special meal because this was the last meal I had with my classmates who had been my friend for more than 4 years. I was a bit sad to admit to myself that I won’t see most of them in my life again and I was happy that I had such a good memory about my school, teachers and friends.\n\nThere was a short speech by 2-3 of our teachers and by 2-3 guardians and after that, the meal was served. Many items were served in the feast and we all ate voraciously as we were hungry. I enjoyed the dessert very much.

    "Answer": "I am never really afraid to say that I don’t really have that many personal characteristics which I could be proud of. In fact, I do a lot of soul-searching, and that perhaps could also be an important personal characteristic, I suppose.  But, I think that I have another personal characteristic, an important one in my humble opinion, about which I would like to talk here today.\n\nThe personal characteristic, I am talking about, is called “patience”. Interestingly enough though, I didn’t really know about this important personal character of mine until one of my paternal aunties had revealed it to me one day about 10 years ago. In fact, up and until then, I didn’t even think that it was such an important personal characteristic, but rather I just thought that every person around me was just like me.\n\nBut, when my auntie told me that I had such an important feature, I curiously asked her as to why she thought like that. In response, she just told me that not many sons would keep themselves up night after night in order to help their mothers because they (the mothers) had some important medical surgeries. By saying this, she was actually referring to my month-long help to my mother when she had gone through a very important medical operation. \n\nNow, I don’t really think (again, I started to think like this only after becoming aware of this through my auntie) that it is such a common characteristic of the majority of the human beings – at least the people I know around me – because I have found them to be complaining a lot.\n\nAnyway, this personal aspect of mine is important to me because it has helped me get over with many unpleasant situations in life by teaching me that not everybody is the same in our world, especially, when I have been treated unfairly. I consider it to be important also because it has helped me to become the person, I am today, who is happy with himself. Now, if you are happy with yourself, what else is that you need in your life?"

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for the topic. It’s kind of tough to talk about someone’s own personal characteristics as I believe, the way we judge ourselves differs from the perspective other people judge us. Nonetheless, we all have our own idea about our own characteristics and I would like to talk about my ability to stay calm even in the time of distress.\n\nI am not short-tempered and I try to remain calm no matter how severe the situation is and I find it a helpful characteristic. From my own experience I can say that, whenever I got very much vibrated and acted very promptly without giving much consideration about the situation, I did not take the right decision and repented for that.\n\nIn my opinion, that should be a common characteristic among other people but my personal experience sometimes contradicts my opinion as I often find people who can’t remain calm in an adverse situation and act very weirdly. So to say, this is not a rare quality but many people lack it.\n\nRemaining calm and using the brain rather than the tongue is a helpful characteristic as it would help you make the right decision and would show you the right way and course of actions. Being very fragile in action and taking a prompt decision without thinking can sometimes lead us to misunderstand and can ruin relationships. Not being able to remain calm also shows your weakness and that often allure you to take a completely wrong decision.\n\nTo me, this is a very important characteristic. This quality has saved me from making many mistakes and saved me from lamenting later on. Being able to remain calm in an adverse situation helps me make the right decision and that’s something which I find very helpful in my personal and professional life."

Nevertheless, I will try my best to pick up one foreign product and tell you why I want to buy it, and if it has any special feature.\n\nAnyway, the foreign product, I would like to buy, is a motorbike called “Harley Davidson”.  Now, for those, who are crazy about the motorbike, and who want to make a statement through their motorbikes, it is not really necessary to introduce Harley Davidson anew. But, to say a little about it - Harley Davidson motorcycle arguably is the best metallic road warrior in the whole wide world.  \n\nStarting its journey in 1903 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin of USA, Harley Davidson motorbike has mesmerized the motorbike lovers from all over the world because of their special features which may include their design as well as their additional horsepower, way more than you would ever need, have made it one of the most sought-after two-wheeled vehicles of the world. Not to mention, of course, its extraordinarily-rapid acceleration ability, more like a 747 Boeing Aircraft taking off, as well as its perceived “coolness” has made the Harley Davidson bikes the dream bikes for millions of the bike lovers of all ages.\n\nOh, did I mention about their design? Well, Harleys are designed like riding a horse. In fact, its riding position is very similar to horse riding. Pretty unique, isn’t it?\n\nAnyway, I want to buy this foreign product, primarily because it is certainly the most dependable and comfortable bike one could ever ride, as has been described by a number of bikers who I know. Besides, I want to buy it also because it would allow me to make a fashion statement to my friends and relatives. Finally, I want to buy it because it seems to be so different, as far as their designs are concerned, from the other bikes."

I went through the cars available in our country and did some research on the internet about the available cars in our city and found that Nissan car as a suitable one for my need. The price is affordable for me and the facilities this car offers, match my requirement.\n\nYes, the auto navigation by the map is a new feature of this car and it would help me to find new locations very easily using GPRS facility with this car. As I have already said, the car model I have planned to buy is a good one in terms of the budget and facilities it offers. This is a good car within my reach and that’s the main reason I want to buy it. Furthermore, Japan has a reputation for producing the finest cars and in my opinion, purchasing a car manufactured by a famous Japanese automobile manufacturing company would be a good deal for me."

    "Answer": "One of the things, which I don’t really like, is a long journey. But, I don’t really control the roads or the flow of traffics on them. So, we can’t really help it if our journeys take longer than expected just as it did when I was travelling to my sister's house about a few months ago.\n\nMy sister, who is younger than me, lives in another town which is a bit far away from me. In fact, in normal traffic and road condition, it usually takes about 8 hours to reach her place. So, I don’t really like to travel to her by road unless I have a very valid reason to do so. So, I try to take the aerial route when I visit her. But, unfortunately, when my sister asked me about a few months ago to visit her in order to help her move to a different place because of her new job location, I couldn’t take any flight. In fact, I found that all the flight tickets were sold because some public holidays were being observed.\n\nSo, I didn’t have any other choice but to take a bus to reach my sister’s place. Initially, the bus was maintaining its regular speed, but after a while, it became slower and slower. I was growing more and more frustrated, but I couldn’t really do anything about it. So, I put my earphone in my ears and started to listen to some of my favourite music on my smartphone. At one point, I even fell asleep, and when I actually arrived at my destination, I was already late by at least a couple of hours.\n\nAnyway, it took me longer than expected because the highway, I took, usually remains very busy most of the time. But, the situation got even worse, as far as the road traffic was concerned, since more than the usual number of people was travelling on that day because of public holidays. Besides, it was only a two-lane highway, as opposed to the 4-lane highway, which forced the traffic to run even slower. Naturally, as a result, my journey was longer than expected."

    "Answer": "The journey that I would like to talk about took almost 3-4 times more than we expected and it was 2 years back when I was in the 2nd year at my university. After the semester break, one of our friends offered us to have a visit to his hometown which was near a very beautiful location with hills and rivers surrounding it. We were very fascinated to visit there because of the chance to visit this part of our country which is a very famous tourist spot. Apart from that we also wanted to enjoy our semester gap by visiting someplace we have never been to.\n\nMy friend’s hometown was in (say a place name) and we started our journey at around 7:30 am. It should have been a 6-7 hours journey and the first 2 hours went very well. We took a bus to go there and after 2 hours we noticed heavy traffic in front of us. The bus was stuck in the same place for about an hour and we heard that there was an accident and that caused the bad traffic. After another 30 minutes, our bus started moving on but it was like slowly pacing in the sand. The speed was not more than 20 km/hour and we got really bored being in such a bad situation.\n\nThe whole journey took around 22 hours and we were very frustrated to be caught in such a bad position. When we reached our friend’s house, we were all tired and I wished I did not decide to have the journey."

    "Answer": "I have fascinations about electronic devices, and interestingly, among my very personal belongings, the number of electronic devices forms the major part. The need for latest electronic devices is never-ending and that is why I often feel to replace my old TV with a new one or want to purchase a new music system when I found it as a new-arrival item in the market.\n\nOne such electronic device that I would like to purchase is a washing machine. I have a washing machine at home but it is more than 3 years old and I feel the need to buy a new one. The model that I have in mind would require a good amount of money and I am planning to buy it at the beginning of the next year. It would cost me around 1,200 USD. Since this is a branded product the price might vary at the time I would purchase it.\n\nThe washing machine that I currently have requires some manual works and I am planning to buy a new washing machine that would require very few manual works to have my laundry work done. The numbers of clothes that need washing have increased dramatically over the years and it has become cumbersome for me to do all those laundry works using the old one I have. Furthermore, the old washing machine does not have any facility to dry the clothes and as a result, I have to take the burden to take all the clothes on the roof-top and have them dried out in the sunlight. The rainy season sometimes makes it very difficult and that’s why I am planning to replace it with a new one that would facilitate me to dry out the clothes as well."

    "Answer": "In the age of the internet, smartphone and Netflix, I don’t think that there are any shortages of opportunities for entertainment. Well, I fully agree with this idea, but there is something which the internet or Netflix is not able to offer always, and that is a “piece of old memory”.\n\nLuckily, however, an electronic device called “DVD Player” can do just that, and that’s why I want to buy a DVD player. A DVD player is an electronic device which is traditionally used to watch movies that are stored in a compact digital and optical disc storage called “DVD” (or digital video discs).\n\nAnyway, before 15 or 20 years, when I was a student, a DVD player was a hot household item at every house. And, it was at that time, I watched so many different types of movies, documentaries, sports, travel shows and many other things on DVD. Needless to say, those were the golden times of my life. But, as time passed and the internet started to rule the world of entertainment in virtually every household, the use of a DVD player started to diminish, and so, just like many, I also got rid of my DVD a while ago.\n\nBut, just because everybody got rid of a DVD player, it doesn’t mean that it has lost its appeal or importance, and that’s why I am planning to buy it in the next few weeks. By the way, I would need to spend only a hundred dollar to buy a DVD player which is not much at all.\n\nI want to buy this electronic device, primarily because it would allow me to watch many of my favourite movies, documentaries, some other rare entertainment programmes, stored in DVD’s, from the old days. However, the best thing about owning a DVD player is that I can watch those movies at my own pace and convenience. Finally, I want to buy it because it would bring back some of the best old memories from my past life when I was enjoying my life as a young student."

    "Answer": "I have always believed that without having good companies or classmates in a school, a student’s life would never really be that fulfilling and colourful. Not to mention, I have also had my fair share of classmates, who have enriched my life with many great experience and memories as a young man, and today, I would like to talk about one of them.\n\nThe name of this classmate of mine was “Himu”, and we had attended the same class together from 7th grade to 10th grade. Not sure how or when I exactly met Himu, but I am assuming that I might have formally met him or talked to him at the local bookshop for the first time when we both were trying to buy some storybooks.\n\nOf course, before that time, we both had seen each other, but never really felt the need to communicate. But, however, it was at that time I found that just as I liked to read adventure stories, and that was the first thing that I knew about Himu other than we both were studying in the same grade. Anyway, later on, I came to know that this classmate of mine didn’t really like to go to the school that much even though, I found him to be a rather brilliant student. Besides, being the only son of a very rich father, I realized that he didn’t really need to go anywhere, much less a school.\n\nAnyway, as classmates, one of our most favourite things to do was to visit a local shopping centre and enjoy our favourite ice creams during the break. Besides that, we also liked to watch football games together.\n\nI still remember this classmate of mine because he was a very laidback and easy going guy with virtually no remorse or expectation. Besides, I never really think of a time when we had any arguments with each other unlike with many others. Finally, I remember him also because he never failed to invite me to his home if his family was having any kind of parties or celebrations."

Some of them became my long term friends at a later time. One of my classmates whom I would like to talk about is Ron who later became a good friend of mine.\n\nI met him at class six after I got admitted to the high school and on the first day of my school, he sat next to me. We started reading together from class six to class ten and after that, he got admitted to a different college. So we studied together for more than 5 years and during these years, we did lots of things together including preparation for the exam, playing, making stuff and visiting different places of our hometown. We often played in the evening together and sometimes we were on the same team and thus enjoyed the games. He often came to my house to watch TV and we mostly watched interesting TV programs. Before the exams, we used to study together and share our notes and other study materials. I remember learning swimming and riding a cycle together. We often used to walk by the bank of rivers and enjoyed our stays.\n\nAs we have been very close for a few years, we had some minor quarrels as well. But those were not very serious as to interrupt our relationship. Most of the days we used to sit close at the classes and shared our books and notes as well.\n\nI mostly remember him because he was a good classmate and a friend as well. We spent good times together and since we had been together for a long time, I have many happy memories regarding the things we used to do together. And that’s why I still remember him."

    "Answer": "People in Bangladesh, my native country, engage in producing different kinds of things for their livelihoods, ranging from food products to clothing items to electronics. However, today, I would like to talk about a handicraft item which arguably is indigenous to Bangladesh only.\n\nThe name of this product is called “Nakshi Kantha”. The term “Nakshi” has been derived from the word “Naksha” which means an array of colourful patterns and designs, and “Kantha” means “patched cloth” on which many gorgeous looking “Naksha” is made.\n\nAnyway, this “Nakshi Kantha” lineage can be traced back to a time when rural women in greater Bangla (including today’s Bangladesh and parts of today’s India) engaged in this form of craft, not necessarily because they wanted to create some kinds of 'art', but out of everyday need. Even though this Nakshi Kantha essentially is a heritage product of Bangladesh, they are prized by many Europeans and Americans today because of their stunning looks.\n\nEven though in the beginning, the sole purpose of the Nakshi Kantha was to be used only as a quilt, but, with the passage of time, they became so popular that it was incorporated into many things, including everyday wear, such as the sari (a single piece of unstitched drape or garment which is used by the women in the Indian subcontinent), Kurtis (a loose collarless shirt which is worn in many regions of South Asia), tablecloths and decorative wall hangings. However, even though, these \"Kanthas\" are used for multi-purposes today, they serve primarily as bed pallets and light wraps. The small Kanthas are used as swaddling clothes for babies in rural areas of Bangladesh also. And, these “special” quilts are made by putting three to seven layers of colourful saris one over another and then sew them with the simple running stitch.\n\nAnyway, Bangladesh produces this particular handicraft item because the country wants to preserve it as a national heritage. Besides, they don’t only help employ a substantial number of unskilled women workers in my country, but also help earn a significant amount of foreign currency since these Kanthas are adored by many foreigners."

    "Answer": "We produce a lot of products which we consume or export in other countries and among those products sports items are very famous. In our country, we produce fine quality game products like football, cricket bats, stamps and jersey. The cricket bats which are produced in our country are used in many cricket playing countries as well as by the big events of ICC.\n\nThe cricket bats are created from fine quality wood and some very professional and experienced people work on that. The woods are first collected and dried to omit the water portion from it. Then the wood is cut in a shape similar to a cricket bat structure. After the structure is given, the bat is then shaped and fine-tuned to produce a good quality bat. Some mechanical help is needed to give the bats good shapes and to make it flawless. After that, the bats are covered with grippers and other stickers.\n\nCricket is a popular game in our country and the materials and expertise which are required to produce those bats are available in our country. A large number of people have acquired the knowledge to produce this fine quality bats and as there is a very good demand for those bats both in our country and in other cricket playing countries, we produce those bats."

    "Answer": "Sometimes, I think that there is nothing better than a relaxing day for a hard-working person after a period of some arduous works. At least, I felt it when I had to work for almost one week, nonstop, and then finally got a day off from my office about a few months ago.\n\nTo be honest, I had never worked for such a long time at a stretch before, but with an overwhelming number of new shipment orders of our chocolate products during a major religious holiday season, I, as a Supply Chain Manager, had no other option but to keep working overtime. To make the situation even worse, a couple of our company staff, working under my supervision, had suddenly fallen sick at the same time, and as a result, couldn’t come to the work.\n\nSo, it was quite a challenge for me to do the works of at least 6/7 people all by myself along with a couple of other junior staff. But, luckily, we aced it, and finally, it was the time for me to relax for a whole day. And, to me, there has never been a better place to relax than going to a lake, find some nice place to sit and practice some fishing. Of course, I never really liked to do this alone, so I took a couple of my close friends with me like any other times to accompany me. By the way, it was not the fishing which was my intention, but rather, I just wanted to enjoy the nature around me while cracking jokes at my friends and enjoying some of our favourite snacks and food.\n\nAnyway, it was a relaxing day, primarily because I didn’t exactly have to worry about my work for the whole day. I found it relaxing also because I could stay close to Mother Nature while listening to some beautiful chirping sound of little birds around me as if they were singing to entertain us. Finally, I was in a very relaxing mood on that day because I could laugh and joke with my best friends for the whole time."

    "Answer": "It was probably during the mid-summer 3 years ago when I joined my first job after finishing my graduation. And as it was a project-based job, I had to work really hard. There was a deadline for a client’s project and the team I worked with had been desperate and determined to meet the deadline. Though I was a new member of the team, they expected me to engage my maximum effort.\n\nI was a bit worried at first and felt a bit perplexed to have such type of pressure just after joining the job. But later, I took it as a challenge and started working hard. After 3 weeks’ of non-stop work and reviews, finally, we were able to deliver the project in time and the office declared 3 days off for the team as well as a bonus. It was Friday and I remember having a very relaxing day. In fact, I spent the whole three days with great satisfaction and relaxing mood than usual days.\n\nI left my bed at around 10:00 am and spent the day mostly at home. In the evening I went to meet a friend and went to watch a movie in the theatre. At night we had dinner together with 2 other friends and I returned home at around 11:30 pm.\n\nIt was a relaxing day mostly because I felt it as a reward after hard work and effort. I had such many days but that day was exceptional because I mentally felt it as a really relaxing day. Naturally, I was feeling good to be able to finish such a tough project and I had three days’ off and that’s why did not feel the urge to go to the office next day. The situation, the routine free life, the contempt and the leisure activities after a long made the day a really enjoyable and relaxing day."

Today, I would like to talk about one such celebration which was attended by several guests.\n\nThe celebration, I am talking about, took place about a year ago from now when my elder brother was celebrating his 10th wedding anniversary. But, celebrating this wedding anniversary wasn’t exactly an idea of my brother or my sister-in-law since they are both more of private persons. In other words, they didn’t really like to bring their private life into public evens if they are just families.\n\nSo, it was me who came up with the idea of this wedding anniversary, but, of course, with the permission of my brother and his wife. By the way, we had decided to celebrate the anniversary at our home, so I decorated with some nice lights and colourful paper flowers which perfectly went with the mood of that special occasion. However, even though, my brother and sister-in-law made the list of guests to be invited, but it was me who decided what kind of anniversary cake should have been ordered.\n\nAt least 50 people were invited at the anniversary party which included my relatives, as well as the friends and co-workers of my brother. The party started at around 7 pm and continued till 11 pm at night, and to be honest, I had never seen my elder brother and sister in law to be so happy as on that special wedding anniversary.\n\nAnyway, at the anniversary, we all congratulated the couple first and then also wished for their long and very happy life. After that, the couple talked about some of their most memorable moments of life which made all of us very happy at times as well as very sad.  Then the anniversary cake was cut and distributed among the guests, followed by a lovely dinner for all of us at the end."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for the topic. There are many occasions that I remember when people came to our houses and among them, I would like to talk about my younger sister’s birthday occasion when more than 50 guests came to our house.\n\nIt was two years ago and I went to my home time three days before my sister’s birthday to celebrate the occasion. It was the mid-January and I had some day offs at that time. I planned to stay for a week there. Initially, my thought was that the birthday would be strictly a family celebration and no other guests would be present. But after I reach home, I learned that many people have been invited and my family is arranging a big party for the birthday occasion.\n\nI went to a nearby shop to buy a gift for my sister as well as any last moment shopping needed for the party. I also bought some fancy items to decorate the house and bought a new dress for my sister. I helped my father on some of the pending tasks regarding the party and went to invite 3-4 of my friends. On the celebration day, I greeted many guests, made sure that they have been offered relaxing places to sit and talked to many of them. When my sister cut the birthday cake, I took lots of photos and finally helped my family members to take care of the guests.\n\nMore than 50 people came to the party including some of our relatives, neighbours, my sister’s friends and 2-3 of my friends. Amazingly I found some of the relatives who I have not met for a long.\n\nThe feast for the birthday celebration was in the evening and the guests were supposed to have dinner at our home. The guest started coming from the early evening and we greeted them. After 1 hour or so, my sister cut the cake and we enjoyed a light food then. The guests enjoyed their stay and some of them gossiped, some of them watched TV and many of them were sitting in different places in our house. At the dinner time, we served the dinner to the guests. The social gathering was the most important part of the party and people seemed like enjoyed each other’s company. At around 9:00 pm people started leaving our home and once again we greeted then and thanked for their time and lively participation."

I still have picnics now once in a while, but I just don’t enjoy them as much as when I was younger. Anyway, today, I would like to talk about one such picnic which I had when I was attending high school.\n\nBack then, I was living in a small town which didn’t offer much for our recreation or entertainment. The only good thing about that town was, of course, it had a great public transportation system, and so whenever I used to get bored of staying in the same little town, I would take a bus and go out of the town for a little change.\n\nNeedless to say, we travelled outside of our little town in a big bus in order to have that picnic since our school supervisor didn’t want us to spoil the fun by having a big picnic in a small town. So, we went to a nice and big park in another city which was about a couple of hours bus ride form our little town. By the way, we had this particular picnic to celebrate and mark the end of our final examination.\n\nAnyway, different kinds of food, drinks and snacks, including chicken kebab and steam rice, pizza rolls, chocolate cakes, fruit drinks and juices, and of course chocolate ice creams as desserts, were offered to us there at the picnic. We also spent a good part of the day enjoying our picnic and returned to our home in the late evening.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed the picnic, primarily because it allowed me to recuperate from the tough study works and examination preparation for the previous two weeks. I also enjoyed the occasion because I got to eat all those great food as much as I could as a young chap.

    "Answer": "I can remember so many outdoor meals or picnics with my friends and family members. In fact, we used to go outing and had our meals outside as part of the picnics very frequently even a few years back. One such picnic was a boat trip to a nearby island called (say a name) where we went 3-4 years ago. It was a small island and that island had some old buildings as well as a beautiful relaxing spot surrounded by natures. The water around the island gives the impression that you have come to an exotic land. We had our picnics on this island. There was no particular occasion for the picnic; as far as I recall the community people of our locality were planning for a picnic and they settled the day in the mid-summer. On the day we had a big boat that took us to the island and we spent the whole day there.\n\nI remember eating fried rice, roasted mutton, chicken, dessert, different cookies fruits and some other food items throughout the whole day during our visit to the island. We drank plenty of waters as the weather was hot. We also drank fruit juices and soft drinks at different times of the day.\n\nIt was a great occasion for me. All of my family members and neighbours were present at the picnic and that was a really relaxing occasion for me. I enjoyed the boat journey and the picnic spot a lot. I played and chatted with the neighbouring kids and that was a very interesting and enjoyable gathering in my opinion."

In other words, the more skill sets someone possesses, the better he or she is positioned to face the challenges, not only in the professional world but also in personal life. Thankfully, I also have a couple of skills, and today, I would like to talk about one of them.\n\nThe skill, I have, is popularly known as “computer fixing or repairing skill”. Now, please don’t get me wrong, when I talk about having this particular skill, because I am not a “professional computer technician” nor do I intend to be one in the near future. But, by saying this, all I am trying to suggest is that I know a few things about how to fix a computer problem when the machine acts up or doesn’t work.\n\nHowever, this particular computer repairing skills of mine is limited to finding and fixing hardware problems mostly rather than fixing some software issues as well. For example, if the computer has a problem with its ribbon inside its case, I would most likely be able to know about it after running the machine.\n\nAnyway, learning this computer repairing skill isn’t really that difficult, depending on how much one really enjoys breaking a computer into pieces and then put them back together again. Besides, it also depends on seriously one really wants to learn about the roles of different computer parts. But, as far as I can say, if a person is willing to read a good book on fixing computer hardware and listen to a “moderately expert guru”, he or she will be able to learn this skill.\n\nAnyway, this particular skill is important to me, mainly because it stimulates my brain unlike anything else, especially, when I have nothing else to do or ponder over. Besides, it also offers me a certain mental satisfaction, knowing that I can fix my own computer, as well as the computers of my friends and relatives, at my own pace. Finally, it is important for me because it helps me save some good money, used on repairing a computer from a technician."

    "Answer": "I’ll talk about driving which I think is the most important skill I’ve ever learned. I guess the main reason as to why it’s so special is that it was a passion for me to see myself at the wheel driving at a fast speed and going where ever I fancied. What’s more, my father bought me a car when I got my driving license which is a great gift to me, both financially and sentimentally.\n\nIt is not a very difficult skill to learn but it requires some dedication, practice and concentration to learn. One can learn it in 7 days with a few hours of practice daily. But to become a really expert driver, someone needs to keep driving regularly for about a year in my opinion.\n\nSomeone interested to learn driving can contact to the local driving school and can get enrolled with the quick driving lessons they have. Alternatively, if someone has his/ her access to a car and can manage someone to teach him/her the driving; s/he can do it as well."

    "Answer": "Today, the world is facing a number of environmental problems which are making our world a very dangerous place to live in. While we all are more or less aware of some of these environmental problems, today, I would like to talk about just one of them which is air pollution.\n\nWell, I don’t really think that I need to define what air pollution really is since it is one of the most burning environmental issues in today’s world. Yet, in simple words, air pollution is a type of environmental pollution that affects the air and is usually caused by smoke or other harmful gases, mainly carbon dioxides, sulphur and nitrogen. So, air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence or introduction of a substance which has a poisonous effect on our earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThis air pollution, of course, is something that our earth is dealing with thousands of years, but since the industrial revolution started about more than 250 years ago, it went from bad to worst very rapidly. And because of this dangerous air pollution, the world is not only facing global warming due to excessive carbon dioxide, destruction of the ozone layer, as well as causing dangerous acid rain, but also causing some serious health issues in humans. In fact, air pollution can make people very sick by making it difficult to breathe. Such air pollution can also cause diseases such as lung cancer, respiratory infections, and heart disease. According to the World Health Organization, 2.4 million people die each year from air pollution. Air pollution can be especially dangerous to children living in big cities with bad smog.\n\nNow, if we really want to prevent this serious environmental problem, we should all try to use lesser and lesser energy, like electricity and gasoline, because they emit excessive carbon in our earth’s atmosphere. Besides, we shouldn’t also cause deforestation because that would increase greenhouse gases and thus resulting in global warming. Finally, we also need to reduce the use of vehicles since they emit dangerous smoke and pollutants in the air."

    "Answer": "Speaking of environmental issues, I should own up to the fact that air pollution is the most lethal one. In the first place, this air you are breathing may be killing you or at least, it may exacerbate many already existing diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and allergies. In the second place, those who are most vulnerable to problems of air pollution are the elderly and children. Pollution has a direct link to pulmonary problems in developing fetuses, and damage to the immune system in adults. That’s why I believe it is highly imperative for governments to take steps to reduce this problem.\n\nTo prevent air pollution the government must make and implement strict laws and rules so that the citizens abide by those laws. The citizens have to realise the air pollution must be prevented for their own benefits and for a healthy life.\n\nThe number of industries and vehicles necessary for our lives cannot be controlled, but we must make sure that the CO2 and other harmful gas those vehicles and industries are omitting are not beyond the borderline. We need to plant more trees and make the environment greener to prevent the problems related to the air."

However, if time and my savings permit, I would like to visit the Niagara Falls some days.\n\nWell, there is really no need for an introduction to the Niagara Falls, but just for some purpose of references, it is a geological wonder and one of the most famous waterfalls in the world which straddles the border between the United States and Canada. This natural wonder has been a popular tourist attraction for over 200 years, as well as a major source of hydroelectric power.\n\nAnyway, the Niagara Falls is located in one continent while I live in another continent, so naturally, I would have to fly all the way to Buffalo, NY and then fly to Buffalo - Niagara International Airport. And the information I have now, it says that I can go to Niagara Falls easily either by “Amtrack” train or bus. By the way, Niagara Falls is only about a half an hour ride or drive from the Buffalo – Niagara International airport.\n\nAnyway, I want to make a journey to this place because since my childhood I have read about it how it is one of the 7 natural wonders of the world. Another obvious reason for which I would like to go to this place is that you don’t really get to see a waterfall every day which is actually made up of three different waterfalls called the American Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and Horseshoe Falls, which combine to produce the largest water flow rate of any waterfall in the world.\n\nAnyway, I am planning to make this journey after a year since I would need to make an arrangement for a long vacation. In fact, I am planning to spend about two weeks in the USA before finishing my journey. And, I will be staying mostly in New York in a hotel because that would allow me to go to Niagara Falls quickly and easily."

Though he has visited our house in a town a few times during this period, I still want to meet him, my uncles and cousins there. I miss my hometown and being there is a great joy for me. I passed my childhood at that place and want to go there as much as possible.\n\nI have planned to go there during the summer vacation I will get from the university. I have planned to save some money and take some money from my parents on this journey. I will take one of my best friends with me and would show him the village where I was born. We will do lots of fun stuff there and would stay for about a week. We have planned to collect the train ticket online and for the taxi, we will book it in advance. I am really looking forward to enjoying this journey and my stay at my grandparent’s house."

    "Answer": "A few years ago, I was trying to buy my first car – a car which I really liked, and which was being sold at a great discounted price. But, even that discounted price was a bit too much for a person like me with a limited income and lots of expenses. So, I decided to secure some loan money from a bank.\n\nBut, the problem was that getting a loan, again, wasn’t really easy for a limited income person like me unless, of course, I could show the bank that I had a substantial amount of \"saving money\" on my name in a bank, or someone with a rather strong financial backup was willing to be a guarantor on my behalf to secure the loan for me. Not to mention, of course, I didn’t have any money, saved up in a fixed deposit account, to show to the loan issuing bank. So, I just gave up the idea of buying the car which I really liked.\n\nAnd, then, a few days later, my rich and elder cousin came to my rescue who offered me to be my loan guarantor. I was surprised and asked my cousin as to how he had come to know about this. In response, he told me that my father gave him a hint about it. So, we both just went to the bank and in no time, the loan was secured. By the way, I never really asked why he chose to help me, but I am assuming that he wasn’t very comfortable with the idea that I would ask help from somebody else outside of my family because that would be an embarrassing thing for my rich cousin.\n\nAnyway, I felt really, really happy and excited because finally, I could get my own car, and that too a car which I genuinely liked.  In fact, I became so emotional after buying that car that I gave a very tight hug to my cousin. I also felt that there are still some people in this world who would help you whether you ask for it or not."

    "Answer": "In my life, I got numerous help and useful advice and I am really grateful to the Almighty for that. Among those, one of the important help I got was from one of my teachers. The name of this teacher was (...say a teacher’s name…) and he helped me during my term final at my grade eight.\n\nThis final exam was very important in terms of getting admitted to a renowned high school. I was very much eager to get a great grade to get admitted to the most renowned high school in our town. My parents had great expectation as well. I was probably 14 years old at that time and on the third day of my exam, I reached to the exam hall at around 8.45 am. as I thought the exam would start at 9:00 am. But to my worst surprise, I noticed that the exam room was already silent and everyone was busy writing on the answer sheets. I could not relate the reality to what was happening. Then I found that a teacher was scolding me for being one and a half hours late for the exam. I could not think rationally and did not know what to do. I felt like I was just thrown down from a mountain and I was falling with great speed without any hope of surviving. At that moment I noticed Mr. (…say the teacher’s name…) and he tried to calm me. He assured me that everything would be fine. Then he asked me the reason for being late. I told him the truth that I had the incorrect timing in my exam schedule.\n\nHe then assured me and after taking permission from the principal, he arranged me the full three hours of exam time. This was really unexpected for me and I did well in the final exam. Because of the help, I got from this teacher, I had been able to secure A+ and got admitted to one of the best high schools in our city. The reason he helped me is that he was a good man with a benevolent heart, goodwill and honesty. He loved his students and simply helped me because he knew that this exam was important to me.\n\nI felt overwhelmed and really grateful for what he did to me. The help was unexpected and that saved me from a disaster. I felt very much happy and grateful. I still feel grateful to this teacher and will always remember the help I got from him that day."

    "Answer": "I am a fan of Hollywood movies as well as the actors and actresses who act in those movies. In fact, I seldom miss a TV programme on Oscar awards or Emmy awards. But, anyway, I will save this talk on Academy Awards for another day, and instead talk about an actress today who happens to be one of my most favourite.\n\nHer name is Julia Roberts. Now, I don’t really think that there is any need for introducing the actress \"Julia Roberts\" anew to the movie fans around the world. She is an American actress whose deft performances in varied roles helped make her one of the highest-paid and most-influential actresses in the 1990s and early 2000s, and she is still carrying on today as invigorated as she ever has been.\n\nAfter starting her Hollywood film career as a leading cast in a movie called “Mystic Pizza” in the year of 1988, Julia Roberts didn’t have to look back anymore as her movie career took off like a rocket. Since then, she has acted in many box office hit movies like “Pretty Woman”, Flatliners (1990), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), The Pelican Brief (1993), Something to Talk About (1995), Mary Reilly (1996), My Best Friend’s Wedding (1997), and Stepmom (1998). She also starred in two popular romantic comedies, Notting Hill and Runaway Bride, which earned her huge fame.\n\nBorn in 1967, Julia has been the golden girl of Hollywood for over 3 decades with her extraordinarily charming and charismatic role-playing abilities in virtually all kinds of movies. No wonder, she has won so many academy awards in her film career.\n\nAnyway, Julia Roberts is my favourite actress, primarily because she knows perfectly well how to blend in all kinds of characters in all of her movies. She is my favourite actress also because she has a great personality outside of her movie life where she has so far managed to stay relatively more scandal-free than many other contemporary actors and actresses. Another aspect of Julia Roberts that makes her favourite to me is that she never stops learning."

    "Answer": "Brad Pitt is one of my very favourite actors and I am a huge fan of his movies. He is a famous Hollywood actor and has got several prizes for his superb work in movies.\n\nHonestly, he is a good actor who is known worldwide. He is the husband of another famous female actress Angelina Jolie. His full name is William Bradley \"Brad\" Pitt and he is around 50 years old now. For his excellent performance in acting he has received a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and three Academy Award nominations in acting categories. He has done some film production works as well. He is a fine actor with a natural gift of depicting the characters. Often his performance in movies gets very high applauses and because of that, he was nominated for Oscars more than once.\n\nHe usually acts in drama and action movies but his acting varies from the character of a vampire to a war hero and legendary characters as well. I have enjoyed most of the movies acted by him and his performance in movies like Seven, Interview with the vampire, The legend of the falls, 7 years in Tibet, Meet Joe Black was simply excellent. I find him to be a very high-class actor and a superb person with his tremendous activity in social welfare works. All these reasons make him my favourite actor."

    "Answer": "As a student of business administration, I needed to take many subjects to fulfil the requirements of my graduation. While I learned many things by studying those courses, today I would like to talk about one particular course that, I think, that has helped me a lot in my professional life.\n\nThe particular course, I am talking about, is \"Business and Professional Communication\". If I remember it properly, I took this course during the 3rd semester of an undergraduate degree with a great teacher in the year of 2014. Even though I was taking other difficult courses during that time, I remember paying special attention to this particular course as I was really enjoying studying it from the start. In fact, this was the subject in which I got one of my highest grades, along with a few other subjects.\n\nBy the way, Business and Professional communication is the process of sharing information between people within and outside a company so that it helps improve the organization practices and reduce errors. Effective \"business and professional communication\" is how employees and management interact to reach organizational goals.\n\nI learned a lot of things by studying this subject, including upward communication, how to effectively communicate with a manager, colleague, as well as a subordinate within an internal organizational setup. I also learned how to conduct external business communication, which involves messages that leaves from an office and internal staff, while dealing with customers, vendors, or any other kinds of communication that impacts a company or brand. Besides, I also learned what kinds of disaster takes place in a company or for a brand when it fails to conduct effective business and professional communication.\n\nAnyway, this is a great course, and I took it because I really wanted to improve my communication skills on both personal and professional levels. I also wanted to make myself valuable for my company, for which I would be working, so that I can play a leading role in shaping the effective communicational parameters for it. I am really glad that I took this course."

    "Answer": "‘Book Keeping & Banking’ was one of the most interesting courses I took in my university level and I thoroughly enjoyed this course. In fact, I learned many new concepts and theory from this course that it helped me a lot throughout the remaining semesters. This was a mandatory course in the 3rd semester in my Bachelor of Business Administration studies and the courses on this subject lasted for four months. I was so interested in this course that later on, I took three other courses in different semesters related to banking.\n\nI learned the accounting concept of banking, how a bank is operated, how the banking transactions and accounting are maintained, how the central banks control the money supply of the market and many more concepts from this course. A practical session was included in this course and I learned some basic transaction processes of bankers from these lab sessions.\n\nIn my third semester, this was a mandatory course and I had no alternatives other than taking this course. I came from the science background until my undergraduate course, and that’s why I had no prior accounting course experience. I was a bit dubious about this course in my university level as I did not know what it includes. But after I completed this course, I found myself very much interested in Banking procedure and automated banking."

    "Answer": "Up and until I took a study tour to the University of Dhaka, the largest public university of my country, Bangladesh, the thought of having a study tour never really interested me that much. Today, I would like to talk about this study tour in a bit more details, which I undertook as a high school student about 12 years ago from now.\n\nBut, the University of Dhaka was quite far away from where I used to live at that time. So, when our school supervisor made an announcement to us that we were going to the University of Dhaka for a study tour, I didn’t really take the matter so seriously, simply because I had missed all the study tours prior to that one. Besides, I was more like one of those lazy high school student at that time who would rather have fun playing some kinds of video games at home instead of travelling quite some distance in order to see some “damaged palace” or some hundred years world heritage site in the middle of nowhere.\n\nBut, this time around, I couldn’t really evade it, as my parents really wanted me to join the other students in that tour because they wanted their “dull” son to become a bit more proactive and smart. So, finally, I also joined about 40 students in a large rented bus which travelled almost 150 kilometres to reach the largest and the oldest university in my country. After reaching there, I was very overwhelmed as I got to roam around such a huge campus with so many students, and so many buildings that had so much history with them.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed the tour, primarily because, to begin with, it allowed me to see the countryside on our way, which was really beautiful. I enjoyed the tour, also because I and my classmates managed to take many, many pictures, and I just love taking pictures. Finally, this study tour was a very memorable one because it allowed me to see many famous places and spots at the university which I had only read about in books until then."

Since it was in a different country (Nepal), we had to collect our visas to enter the country. From our country, we flew to the Nepal National Airport and from there we took a tour bus to reach the camping area near the Himalayas. After a few hours journey, we reached the camping area and we were very excited to be there. We were almost 30 members and four tour guides with us.\n\nPersonally, I was very much thrilled to visit the largest mountain peak and when I reached the camping area, I got awestricken. It is beyond explanation in words. The snow-covered mountain, balmy wind, the sound of nature, vast and wide area simply took my heart away. I stayed there for about a week and we did some mount hiking and fire-camping and all of those activities were really exciting and new for me. I enjoyed the nice vacation, natural scenery, companion of my classmates and friends. That was a relief from the busy city life and being close to nature. I enjoyed this tour so much that the whole week seemed like passed just like a fleeting moment. I promised to myself that, I will come back to visit the out-of-the-world place someday."

    "Answer": "When I was attending an elementary school, I didn’t really know very much about how a school should have been. But, one thing is for sure that I really liked going to my elementary school as a child. So, I guess, I am going to go ahead and talk about my elementary school which I last attended about 20 years ago.\n\nThis elementary school, I attended, wasn’t exactly a very big school since it was located in a rather small town which didn’t probably have more than 15 or 20 thousand population. Back then, my whole family was living there since that was where my father’s job site was.\n\nAnyway, even though it was a rather old school (from someone, back then, I heard that some famous landlord built that school on his private property about 150 years ago), it surprisingly looked very well-maintained. Of course, there were some cracks here and there on its buildings, but it still looked great in some vibrant light yellow colour. The school had about 7 or 8 buildings if I remember correctly, but they all were designed and lined in such a beautiful manner that they together formed a shape of half-moon crescent from a distance. Besides, the school also had a large pond with clear water in front of it, and a moderately large empty space which occasionally was used as a football stadium by us.\n\nThe teachers of the school were very friendly and passionate about teaching. By the way, our school had a dress code, but our good teachers would never admonish us for failing to stick with it. Most of our teachers were young in age, so it was really easy for us to relate to them.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed my time in this elementary school, primarily because it had a rather laid-back and relaxed environment. Besides, since the school had a relatively small number of students, we all were like a family, and we pretty much all knew each other. What I also loved about the school the most is that the teachers there would make our lessons very interesting and enjoyable."

    "Answer": "(…say your elementary/ primary school name…) was the first school I went to and this is the school I will always remember. The school was in the middle of my hometown just behind the city hall. The school was located beside a big park and a pond that gave it a nice view. I got admitted to this school when I was only 4 years old and because of that, everything was new to me. I had a very positive vision of the school, teachers, friends and I was very lucky to be in this school that taught me many important aspects of education and life.\n\nI studied in this school for about 3 years and I enjoyed my time there a lot. The school was a nice place with a suitable environment for the kids. It was a 4 storied building of L shape and there were almost 200 students there. The teachers were very helpful and very friendly. I never found them in a rough mode with students. Managing and taking care of 200 students is not an easy task and to my surprise, the teachers were very dedicated and caring to do that perfectly.\n\nThey always treated us like their own children and there were numerous times we got gifts from them. They have helped us a lot to prepare for our study and also taught us about the values and ethics of life.\n\nI enjoyed the environment of our school, especially the big garden, playground and canteen. I also enjoyed having such great teachers who were caring and good humans. In the break time, I used to play with my classmates and that’s something I will never forget. The childhood is magical and pleasant and for me, this became even happier because of the school I went to."

Today, I would like to talk about once such house that I visited about 10 years ago and liked too.\n\nThe house, I am talking about, was more like a vintage home which was probably built around 100 years ago or so. Located in the older part of the city, where my family used to live back then, this particular house must have attracted the attention of many people because of its unique design and large size.\n\nI visited this old house because one of my favourite university teachers lived there, and he invited me to attend the wedding ceremony of her only daughter. Anyway, as soon as I got closed to that old house, I notice that it was surrounded by a 5 feet tall boundary, and adjacent to that boundary were all kinds of flower plants. Then, once I entered the house premise through the boundary gate, I could see a huge two-storey building, with a rather large terrace next to it that was covered by a large umbrella-like structure. The umbrella-like structure was designed so beautifully that anybody would want to sit under it for a while before actually entering the main house building.\n\nAnyway, once I entered the house, I saw a large hall that had a shape of an octagon and that also had some very exquisite looking marble stones on its floor. The house was built at such a perfect elevation from the ground that one would think that the flower trees on the boundary were so close to the house, even though they were actually at least 50 feet away from it.\n\nAnyway, I liked the house, primarily because of its unique design and structure. In fact, I had never really seen any octagon shape house which looked so beautiful. Besides, the marble stones on the floor of that house gave me the impression that whoever had built that house had quite an extraordinary taste."

    "Answer": "I went to visit Ireland (…or say a different country/ city name…) after the completion of my first semester. This would probably be the May 2012 and as I recall it was around 2 weeks’ visit. I went to visit (…say a village or urban area name…), a friend’s house and in this area, there was a gigantic house (more specifically a castle) that caught my eyes.\n\nI heard that my friend’s father had a good connection that would allow us to visit this castle. I went inside the house and walked from floor to floor and it took me more than 4 hours.\n\nThis was 200 years’ old castle and I saw a real castle for the first time in my life during this visit. This was a great and different experience. I have read about these castles and even saw them in the movies, but witnessing the castle was something totally different. The castle was built with stones and the area was more than 2 acres. The castle was surrounded by thin lakes and it had well defence systems. Though there was no soldier or guard for war or defence, yet it took me to the feudal age and the history revealed itself in front of me.\n\nThe impression of this castle in me will last for a long time. The height of the castle, the shiny stones, stairs, cryptic rooms, large gates gave a totally strange and different view than any other modern buildings I have seen. As this was my first visit to any real castle, I was mesmerised. I have never witnessed anything like this before. I liked the architectural design, height, history related to this, gigantic buildings, defence system, open area, thin lake, the cryptic rooms and war equipment of this castle."

Today, I would like to talk about one such rock music which I really liked to listen and still like.\n\nThe title of this rock music is “Time” which was created and sung by one of the best and most popular music bands ever, “Pink Floyd”. Now, I am not sure exactly how I heard that song or how I got my hands on it, but one thing is for sure that when I heard the first two lines of the song (Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day, Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way), I felt like the artists of this beautiful song was trying to describe what I was exactly thinking about my life back then as a student. \n\nSince then, I have heard this song numerous times, but it never really feels old. In fact, whenever I listen to this song some times in these current days of life as a mature adult, it does a wonderful job to take me back to the hay days of my life when I didn’t have to worry about my life too much. Anyway, this is such a good song that probably music lovers from all ages listen to it, but I think that mostly young adults, below 30 years of age, listen to this beautiful song the most. And, as far as I am concerned, even though, I listen to it probably once a week these days, the sound of it, as well as its message, echoes in my mind relentlessly.\n\nAnyway, I like this song so much because I think that this is the greatest song ever written in terms of lyrics. In fact, I think that it is a life-lesson for people of all ages, who don’t utilize their time properly. I like this song also because of the storm of emotion, which creates in my mind, in order to remind me about my golden past."

    "Answer": "Right across the street, where I live, there is a small shop that sells all kinds of electronics items. I like to visit this shop every now and then, probably because I have known the people there for a long time. It is, of course, a family business, and I would like to talk about it here in brief.\n\nBut, I didn’t know that it was a family business until about a year ago when my father told me that his friend (the owner of the shop) started this business about 30 years ago in partnership with a couple of his cousins. But prior to that, his father and uncle used to own and run this shop without any help from outside. Of course, now that the shop is really busy and popular among its customers, the owners of this electronics shop have hired a few staffs in order to help them run their business smoothly. However, the best thing (and, probably also the confusing thing) about this family business is that it is very difficult to know who is the owner and who is the staff there.\n\nBy the way, even though, it was a small shop, many customers visit this shop in order to buy their electronics products, probably because most of the items there are sold at a very affordable price.  In fact, the shop remains so busy most of the times that seldom I have seen the staff of this shop sitting idle or talking to each other, as they are always found to be busy either in organizing the products on the shelves or helping the customers to find their preferred items.\n\nAnyway, I think that it is a great family business which has managed to build a great reputation among all kinds of customers. The staff members in this shop are very friendly, and they genuinely want to give back to the community in which they run their business. Besides, even though, it is a small business, it has survived all kinds of challenges and competition (from other businesses in the area) to establish itself as a successful family business."

But, still, I remember writing a few important letters in my life in good causes, and today, I would like to talk about one of them.\n\nIf I remember it correctly, I wrote this letter about 8 years ago, when I was either a 3rd year or 4th-year university student, to a very good high school friend of mine. He was a brilliant medical student at a medical college, and he always wanted to go abroad in order to do his post-graduation studies and research at a very good medical school. He even eventually succeeded in securing admission with a scholarship at a good medical school in the UK except, of course, the problem was my friend’s father was a person with some “physical disability”, and as a person with a physical disability, he naturally wanted his son to stay close to him.\n\nSo, anyway, when his father heard the news of my friend’s admission at a foreign medical school, he asked his son not to leave the country. Naturally, he got very disappointed and depressed after learning about his father’s opinion, and he even explained the situation to me in a letter, asking me for my opinion. Needless to say, I wasn’t really prepared to give my opinion on such an important issue, but still, I wrote a letter to him in which, I suggested him to listen to his father. In defence to my opinion, of course, I argued that family is always more important at the end of the day than studies or career.\n\nAnyway, it was an important letter, primarily because I was writing it in order to express my opinion on such an issue which would ultimately decide the fate of a person. Besides, it was at the time of writing this letter that we should all have sound judgements in life because other people around us significantly rely upon our actions and judgements."

It was probably 2007 and I wrote this important letter to get a solution for the repair of a bridge in our locality.\n\nThe letter was about the request of people of our community for repairing a bridge that thousands of people use daily. This was an old bridge and after an earthquake, it was in a dangerous situation. The accident might have happened anytime and the emergency repair work was needed. I wrote a letter to the councillor of our city corporation stating the facts and many persons of our locality signed on the back of this letter.\n\nWriting this letter was very important as the councillor of the city corporation was the right person to authorise the repair work of the bridge. After I felt that we were in a great danger, I wrote that letter and amazingly after few days the councillor came to visit the bridge and made necessary arrangement to have it repaired.\n\nI have written many letters and among them, this one was related to an issue of public safety. Since the prompt response was taken after I posted that letter, I felt really good about it. For all these reasons, this letter was of the most important letters I have ever written."

From the architecture of the enchanting Gothic old town to some breathtaking artworks that peppers all over the city, and the endless fiestas that bring the locals out to party in the streets, you just name it, and Barcelona has it. But what people don’t say that it is also the home to one of the biggest and most popular music festivals in the world which I attended and enjoyed about a few years ago.\n\nNow, when I flew from Malaysia to visit Spain, I and couple of my friends had no clue or plan whatsoever for attending the music festival called “Primavera Sound” in Barcelona. In fact, we only flew there to see a close friend who was working and living in a small town called “Terrassa” (only about 25 kilometres from Barcelona). But, as we were roaming in the streets of Barcelona, my friend told me that Barcelona was usually very crowded in the month of June since many music lovers from all over Europe would flock there to enjoy the music festival. My friend even told us that artists from at least 40 countries around the world come to perform there every year, and so it was like a “haven” for music lovers.\n\nLearning about the festival, all of my friends, including me, decided that we would also go to that music festival. After all, it was like a “once in a lifetime opportunity” for us since none of us would know for sure that we would ever come back to Spain again.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed the foreign music festival, primarily because it offered me the opportunity to listen to some of the world’s most popular artists live. Besides, they played so many different genres of songs, be it rock, hip hop, electronic, with such a huge range of styles that I was actually struggling to keep up with them. The atmosphere there was so electric, with so much clapping and cheering around us, that I had forgotten about all of the worries of my worldly life for the night."

    "Answer": "During my visit the United Kingdom (...or say a country name you prefer…) I attended a music festival there that I enjoyed thoroughly. I went there all of a sudden when I was roaming the London city with one of my friends. I did not even know about the musical program and when I noticed that a few famous singers would be joining the festival, I decided to attend there.\n\nIt was probably 2008 when I was in London to visit my sister’s house and at that time I attended the festival. I am a great enthusiast of music and I usually enjoy music festivals. So I did not miss my chance to attend this festival. The location was second Hampton Street and the festival was in a wide area. As I recall, a small fair and gathering were outside the auditorium and I had to spend a small amount of money to enter the festival.\n\nThere were some solo performances by young and rising singers and they performed really well. People applauded their performance very much. The presenter told a great lot about the music and since there were many foreigners, she also introduced the songs and singers in great details. Finally, she told about the music history and the history of England’s music and musical instruments.\n\nThe cool breeze, the people with gaudy dresses, the music and singers took my heart away. I was greatly touched with the local songs and when I saw one of my very favourite singers on the stage, I got very much excited. The festival was a different experience for me especially when it was in a different city."

    "Answer": "Ooh, it’s really fun to think about what to talk about this topic!  I can think of a great form of exercise I used to do but don’t anymore. I’m going to tell you all about what sort of activity it was, how long I did it for and why I stopped. As to whether I’d like to do it again in the future, you’ll find out later.\n\nThe exercise I did was called Body Combat, and I loved it at the time. It was a period of my life when I was working part-time and studying for a post-graduate qualification simultaneously so I was pretty busy. To help me stay fit and healthy I joined a local gym. Knowing I find it hard to motivate myself I signed up for some classes where there would be an instructor to motivate me, and it was really by chance I ended up picking this activity.  It just happened to be scheduled for days and times that fitted with my work and study timetable.\n\nThe classes were hilarious. They were hard work because they were extremely energetic, we worked through a number of routines to very loud music. The exercises were apparently inspired by the number of different disciplines and martial arts such as karate, taekwondo, tai chi and boxing.  It was a great way to get fit and lose weight too - calorie burning is easy as you kick and punch through the workout. Although our instructor took it all very seriously, yelling at the class and ferociously demonstrating moves with high kicks and punching, those of us who attended treated it all a bit more light-heartedly.  I think you need a sense of humour if you are as uncoordinated as me and trying to do a sequence of back high kicks and under-cut punches. I’m not even sure if I’m naming the moves correctly. The rest of the group felt the same as me, we often fell about with laughter as we tried to keep up with the routines, much to the annoyance and frustration of our fitness coach. I went three times a week for about a year, and it was the fittest I’ve ever been to.\n\nI was really sorry to give it up, but eventually, I finished my masters (the postgraduate course) and had to get a full-time job, then there just was no opportunity to get to the classes anymore. I did try one with a different instructor, but that wasn’t nearly so much fun, the new teacher was a bit too polite and it didn’t work as well. Then I ended up relocating to a different area and Body Combat classes don’t seem to happen where I now live, it is such a shame.\n\nI would love to do Body Combat again, though I’m older and stiffer now, I don’t know if I’d be able to keep up.  The problem is I think it has rather gone out of fashion as an exercise format. Funnily enough, I was looking on the internet only last week to try and find a class that ran locally to me, but there was nothing.  I think Zumba – a workout to dance music -is the new craze, but I miss my entertaining combat classes and fellow classmates, those were the days!"

    "Answer": "I have had my fair share of juggling with different kinds of exercises as a grown-up man, but none of them really appealed me that much for some obvious reasons. However, there was one particular exercise which I really liked to do and even continued for a long time, unlike the other forms of exercises, but eventually lost my touch with it. I will tell you here what happened.\n\nThe particular form of exercise, I used to do before and don’t do it any longer, is cycling. Now, I am not sure about others, but I really enjoyed cycling. In fact, I think that there are hardly any other exercises, except for probably swimming, in which, each and every muscle of a person is used in such a balanced manner. Besides, the fact that more than 70 per cent of our body weight is held by the saddle of the cycle, the pressure on our joints are very, very low, which makes a rather safe exercise. On top of that, the opportunity to learn more about the city and its streets, enjoying the gentle breeze under some old trees, and sweating under the heat when you feel that extra energy in you are something you don’t get to do in other forms of exercises.\n\nAnyway, I continued doing this exercise for about a couple of years, but don’t do any more for some practical reasons. The first reason is, the streets and roads, I used to ride my bicycle on, don’t have any separate lane on them anymore as the city decided to get rid of in order to accommodate the movement of extra traffics. Besides, I have become busier with my profession which makes it rather difficult to squeeze some times to do cycling.\n\nWell, I am a little sad that I can’t do cycling anymore, but if I get an opportunity or extra time to do this exercise again, I will certainly go ahead and do that. After all, I do miss that unadulterated connection with mother nature, which I got to enjoy when I was doing that exercise with my little bicycle."

    "Answer": "I used to ride a bicycle almost 2 hours per day in the evening when I was in my college but for a long, I have not done it. I had a racing cycle that I got from my elder brother as a birthday gift and after that, I decided to do cycling as part of my exercise. It was 2012 and after 2013, I got busy with my study/ work and could not continue this form of exercise.\n\nI can’t recall what was the exact reason I stopped riding the bicycle but as I remember I stop doing it either I was sick for a few days or because I had final exams. Either way, after I stopped it, I had not been able to restart this exercise. Definitely, I would like to start this exercise as this is a very effective exercise that keeps someone fit as well as refresh mentally. I am planning to start this in a few months and this time I would be in better hold not to quit.\n\nAs I recall I had been in better health when I used to do this exercise. I used to take my cycle and with friends used to ride the free roads beside the hills and tea gardens. That was a great opportunity to spend time with friends, roaming around the city and being close to nature. In my opinion, that was a great outdoor activity that kept both my body and mind fresh. I would certainly start this again in the near future."

    "Answer": "Different people have different ideas about relaxation. While some people like to relax alone in some secluded area, others are quite the opposite and like to remain in the company of others. For better or worse, my idea of relaxation is to feel comfy on a sofa and watch some TV, either alone or with others.\n\nNow, I am not sure since when I have had this idea of relaxation, but I am assuming that it started from my high school when I used to see my father relaxing in our living room, in front of our TV, while enjoying some hot tea and interesting TV programmes. Of course, my father was way more disciplined, unlike me, in deciding exactly how long he was going to spend his time relaxing like this. But, when it comes to me, I would sit in front of my TV and keep watching different kinds of programmes at least for 2 hours.\n\nHowever, these 2 hours could easily be 3 hours if there was any arrangement for some good snacks, especially, if they are home-cooked by my mother or sister-in-law. In fact, sometimes, I enjoy relaxing like this, even more, when my entire family join me because that would allow me to talk about all of my interests, problems and frustration. After all, what could be more relaxing if you could vent out your frustration to your loved ones who don’t mind listening to you? By the way, some people like to go out to relax, but as far as I am concerned, my home is the best place for me to relax.\n\nAnyway, spending my time at home like this is relaxing for me, primarily because home is where I feel more emotionally secure. Besides, when I relax at home, watching different kinds of interesting TV programmes, I become more intellectually stimulated, and to me becoming intellectually stimulated is just as much fun as poking funs at friends and family members. Finally, I like this way of relaxing because I can always be “myself” at home, as opposed to pretending to be “somebody else” in public."

    "Answer": "Listening to my favourite music is very relaxing for me and I feel refreshed and energetic with this activity. This is one of the most effective ways to relax both mentally and physically and for me, it has been proven to be a very effective way of relaxation.\n\nIf I am at home, I listen to music either on my computer or in my music player. I listen to music when I work or even when I take a nap. Sitting on the balcony and listening to soft music is an out-of-the-world experience that I often enjoy. When I am at work, I use my iPod to listen to my favourite songs. Even in public transportations, listening to music is relaxing.\n\nI listen to music mostly alone but sometimes I listen to it with friends who have similar taste in music. For that, I use the speaker instead of the headphone. Sometimes my niece comes to my room to listen to her favourite music and I play her favourite music on my laptop. So in a sense, I often do that with her as well. But most of the time I enjoy music alone."

    "Answer": "My friend, Minhaz, is from a very wealthy family, and I don’t think that he ever had to make any decision, let alone a difficult decision, in his life. But, funny things happen in life, and even Minhaz, the only child of a billionaire father, had to make a difficult decision just to make his family happy. Let me tell you the story here in brief.\n\nWell, to tell the truth, Minhaz loved his parents very dearly, and I don’t really think that he ever did anything against the advice or will of his parents. He studied engineering even though, he didn’t like to do so. He liked to enjoy riding his expensive motorbikes (trust me, he had a few of them) in the highways, but since his parents were afraid about his life, he refrained from doing so. He liked to travel a lot to different parts of the world, but, again, he gave up on that idea because his parents were nervous about him travelling abroad.\n\nSo, essentially, my friend, Minhaz, gave up everything just because his parents didn’t approve of those except, of course, one thing: he didn’t want to give up on his university sweetheart who he loved so much. Yes, Minhaz loved that girl too much, and he wanted to marry her. But, his parents had a different idea as they wanted their son to marry another woman of their choice. But, anyway, as Minhaz stuck to his decision to marry the girl he loved, his parents ordered him to leave their house and live somewhere else. Needless to say, Minhaz wasn’t really ready to deal with such predicament, but in the end, he took the difficult decision to leave his parents’ house to marry his university sweetheart.\n\nAnyway, it was indeed such a difficult decision for my friend to leave his parents’ house since he really loved them so dearly. Besides, the thought of disobeying his parents suffocated him, but since he loved that girl so much, he just didn’t have any other choice but to make such a difficult decision. I have met them after they got married and I am sure they are living happily wherever they are now."

    "Answer": "My close friend Mark (... or say a name...) made a very tough decision and in my opinion, that was one of the most difficult decisions I have ever seen someone to decide. He had to decide whether the doctors should try to save his wife's life or the yet-to-born baby's life. That day I was in the hospital and I went to the consulting doctor's room with him. The doctors told that the mother's health condition was pretty severe and the baby would have a great deal of complexity to be operated. Both the mother and baby's lives were in danger and as the father and husband, Mark would have to decide what he wants.\n\nThough that was a very tough call, my friend had to take prompt decisions. I noticed tears were dropping slowly from his both eyes. Finally, he decided that his wife's life should be given more priority that the yet-to-born baby.\n\nThere's no doubt that it was a very tough decision to take. That was a life and death situation for my friend's wife while a much-desired child was on the other hand. Once the decision was taken, it could not be reversed and choosing either wife's life or baby's life is definitely one of the hardest decisions for a man. My friend must have gone through a hard time and stressful experience to decide and the situation was very tough to handle. It was like choosing an impossible thing but you have to choose. The wife was the life-partner and his life-long companion while the baby was the dream, representative of the next generation and a blessing for him. Letting go either one is not an easy decision and my friend Mark had to decide something very tough like this."

    "Answer": "After trying different kinds of news sources, such as newspapers, periodicals, magazines, the internet and TV, I have a feeling that most news sources have lost their sense of objectivity. Having said that, however, I still think that TV news is a bit more reliable than the other sources. I would be more than happy to tell you why I think so in a minute.\n\nAnyway, the world has become too fast, and without watching the news on a daily basis, it is actually too difficult to keep up with a world that is changing very fast right in front of our eyes. In the early days of TV, of course, as far as I can remember, there used to be news on the television only a few times a day, but as the world became more and more globalized in order to meet the increasing demand of its citizens to remained “informed”, the TV stations started to air the news more frequently.\n\nIn fact, there is hardly any TV station in this world which doesn’t air the news every hour! So, while in the past, I would be happy to see the news on TV only a couple of times, these days, I can see it at least a dozen of times, even if I don’t want to see it. So, I think, we should also thank the satellite or cable TV channels for making this kind of continuous news possible not only on TV but also on other news sources. Of course, when talking about “other news sources”, I don’t really use them to get my news except on some rare occasions.\n\nTV is my favourite news source, primarily because I can always get the updated version of the news, no matter when I watch them. Besides, the best thing about watching the news on TV is that I can actually do other things at my pace while also listening to the news update at the same time without wasting my time. Finally, I find TV news more trustworthy since I can see the video or live image to confirm the incident or news."

    "Answer": "The daily newspaper is my favourite news source and I read newspapers daily. In the morning I go through the headlines of two newspapers at my home. I read newspapers at my workplace/ university during the lunch break and often I read the details of the news and editorial in the evening. Thus newspapers are my primary source of news and current events.\n\nI read mostly current events, political news, sports news, business news, financial and show-biz news and news stories. Those are the types of news items I feel most interested in. I also like the editorial and in-depth coverage of international news as this news and writing give insight and different viewpoints of news or an event. Apart from newspapers I sometimes watch television and listen to the radio and those two are good sources of news also. I use the internet at home, at office/university and online news source like news websites, online radio channels and news feeds are very handy sometimes. I can collect most recent news updates and details from the internet and nowadays online news sources are getting very popular. When I drive my car, I rely on radio news and at home, I often watch television news. The online news portals, news directories, blogs are good sources for authentic and comprehensive news. I browse those sorts of news portals and websites at home and at university/ offices as well.\n\nAmong all the news sources I use, newspapers in my favourite source for gathering news and getting updated. I find it very convenient, easy to access and friendly to read. The newspapers are supplied by the local newspaper distribution authority to my home and that’s why I can easily get it every day. I can read it anytime I like, I can skip the news I do not feel interested about and the news is presented in a suitable manner. In my opinion, the news presented in a newspaper are well organised, well written, authentic and based on the people’s interest and current events of the country and the world. Personally, I consider it as the best source of news for me and I also believe a large percentage of the total population in my country also rely on this news source as their primary source for news and current events."

So, thank you for this interesting cue card topic as it reminds me of a great and interesting time of my life.\n\nAs I've just mentioned above, it all happened about 8 years ago, when I was a college student. Going forward with the story, one day I went to our college cafeteria to get some snacks for me as I was feeling really hungry. The cafeteria boy (about 16 years old) knew it very well what I liked for my afternoon snacks. But, just when the cafeteria boy was about to give me my favourite egg noodles with some ketchup on the side, another guy asked for the same noodles except, of course, there was no more egg noodles left. Ceasing on this rather awkward moment, the cafeteria boy very judiciously and yet very charmingly told to both of us that we both could actually split the food in half so that we both would be able to enjoy our afternoon snacks. Needless to say, both of us started to laugh at the witty solution of that cafeteria boy, and we indeed split the egg noodles between us, as per the suggestion of that young boy.\n\nAfter finishing our snack, I wanted to pay the bills, but Mark (that’s the name of my new friend) insisted that he had rather paid the bills. And, from that point on, our great friendship began.\n\nAnyway, after meeting on that interesting afternoon, both I and Mark have gone to places, like enjoying movies together, playing billiards, and doing motorbike racing. We even went to visit each other’s grand parents’ places almost every month by riding our motorbikes. Mark was afraid of swimming and never really liked to eat fish. But, after becoming my best friend, he didn’t just learn to swim, but also started to like eating grilled fish. So, I am indeed glad that I met Mark, my best friend."

We went to their home in the evening and stayed there till late night. I found a boy around my age was present at the party and was looking at me quite often. All of a sudden he came to me and asked if my name. I found that he was in grade 4 and was quite good at Math and History. He offered me to play the chess with him and he also showed me his book and stamp collections. This is how I met my best friend at his sister’s birthday party and with time our friendship and intimacy grew stronger.\n\nWe often played football, chess and other games together. Since we studied in the same high school, we did countless things together including wandering in old houses & forest, fishing, making toys and gaming tools, watching games and movies, sharing foods, studying and even fighting together. We had many common interests and hobbies like collecting stamps, visiting places, swimming in the river, playing football, and drawing.

    "Answer": "Among many other things, being a proud and privileged Canadian also means that you get to try different kinds of amazing and tasty foods all year round. Today, I would like to talk about one such food which is like a very popular signature dish of Canada.\n\nThe name of this famous food is called “Tourtière”. Originating from the Canadian province of Quebec, it is a Canadian meat pie dish that is usually made with minced pork, veal or beef and potatoes. But, even though, it has been originated in French-Canada, it is not exclusive to Quebec only. Rather, this savoury dish is also served all over Canada and its bordering areas of the USA.\n\nAnyway, in order to cook “Tourtiere”, one would need two pie crusts, the meat of choice, some mashed potato, clove, allspice, onion and cinnamon. Then, in a large skillet, heat some olive oil to medium-high. Add your onion, your beef and pork, and let it brown. Break up the meat into small pieces as it cooks. Add the mashed potato and spices. Later, in n a small bowl, whisk together the meat broth and flour together. Pour that into the pan and mix everything until the potato has dissolved into a filling and your broth has thickened. Then place your meat filling on one crust and then cover them the other crust. Later, place your meat pie in a 375˚F oven and bake for 45 – 50 minutes. Viola! Your meat pie should be nice, golden brown and ready to serve! By the way, one would be sure to like its juicy and crunchy taste of the roasted onion and beef/pork. On top of that, the aroma of clove would stimulate your taste bud like nothing else.\n\nAnyway, it is a famous food, mainly because it is used as a staple Christmas dish in pretty much all over Canada. Besides, it is famous because nothing really brings the family together like the unique and delicious taste of “Tourtiere”."

But, when we do learn about a piece of exciting news, it sure feels good to share it with others, just as I am about to do here today.\n\nI learned about this exciting news about 5 years ago when I had just finished my undergraduate studies from a university. Naturally, it was time for me, either to continue my Master’s degree or get a job. But, I was in no hurry as I wanted to weigh both options ahead of me in a careful manner. Of course, my family was desperately trying to convince me to have a job. But, on the other hand, the majority of my friends were pushing me to start my postgraduation at a reputed university, since I had a rather good academic result, preferably with a scholarship. Not to mention, I liked the idea of my friends, but I didn’t want to study at just any reputed university, rather I wanted to study at a good foreign university.\n\nSo, I started contacting foreign universities one after another in which I had a chance to receive a scholarship. Finally, after gathering the necessary information, I decided to apply to a few UK universities that met my requirements.  All the universities, which I had applied to, confirmed to me in an email (a new email account that I had just created), even though, I was wishing that they would rather inform me in a formal letter. Anyway, after waiting for almost 4 weeks, I finally got an email from one of the universities, congratulating me for securing an admission there with a scholarship!\n\nAnyway, it was indeed a piece of exciting news because I was able to prove to my parents and family that I had it in me to qualify for better opportunities. It was a piece of exciting news also because it had allowed me to study at a dream university of my choice."

In fact, just recently, I have learned that we have a national cricket team now who are playing with other cricket teams, albeit rather irregularly.\n\nBut, certainly, this particular sport is not even remotely popular like other sports, such as soccer (football), hockey, swimming and golfing. By the way, even though, I have been planning to start playing this game for some time now, I haven’t managed to do it yet, mainly because I have been fairly busy with my work all these times.

In fact, I have already spoken to them about my new-found hobby, and they told me that they would be more than happy to teach me cricket. But, before anything else, I would need to buy my own bat, as they said.\n\nAnyway, I want to start playing this new sport, mainly because I have some free time now, and I just want to spend it learning something new and interesting.

Actuality the expense is very low and that wouldn’t be a problem for me to start the activity.\n\nThough I often watched this game on television or in our local playground, I never played it myself. Maybe I was a bit anxious about the performance or skill of mine in this game and that’s why I have not started it yet. I planned to start playing it when I was in grade 9, but because my family had to move to a new city, I could not start it.\n\nThis is a game that fascinates me and since I often watch it on television, I have a great passion for it. Two of my previous attempts to start playing this game were ruined and I feel somehow that has enhanced my interest in this game even more. I need to shape my body and I found it would be a great game to do so. That’s the most important reason I want to start as soon as possible."

    "Answer": "Just like everybody else, I also like to free myself from the tiring and monotonous schedules of daily work life once in a while. To do that, I try a combination of different things, and driving to an area near the sea with my friends every weekend, if not more often, happens to be one of those things.\n\nBut, before anything else, I must admit that in the beginning, I wasn’t exactly very much fond of riding almost a couple of hours in order to spend my time in an area near the sea for two reasons: the first reason was that I was a bit too lazy and as such, I rather preferred to sleep. The second reason is that I was a bit embarrassed to ride in my friends’ cars since I didn’t have my own car. But, when my friends convinced me that I would definitely enjoy the ride and the place, and they really enjoyed my company, I finally decided to give it a go. And I am so glad that I actually decided to give it a go since it, later on, became one of my best hobbies to visit that beautiful area near the sea and enjoying the fresh coffee and very delicious seafood there while also enjoying the gentle sea breeze and beautiful nature around. By the way, all of my friends have become so much hooked to this idea of spending our time like this every weekend that if we somehow miss this weekly “getting together” time of ours, we feel like our whole week is ruined.\n\nAnyway, I like to spend my time like this in a beautiful open space near the sea because it offers a sense of tranquillity in my heart and mind while forgetting all about my troubles and pains for a while. I do it also because it allows me to break free from all the unnecessary formalities and etiquettes life to become the “real me” for a little."

    "Answer": "I often browse the social networking website Facebook and write for my blog when I do not have studies, approaching exams or other important tasks. I use Facebook to update my status, to share the news or photos, to know the updates of my friends, to chat with them and to be on a platform where most of my friends and relatives are connected.\n\nI also have a technology-and-hobby related blog where I write blog posts, answer questions asked by visitors and moderate the guest blogging. I usually do it on my laptop or on my desktop computer. I sometimes use my Facebook account from my mobile phone. But for the blog writing and moderation, I rely on my desktop computer.\n\nI have two friends who help me updating my blog. They often give me blog post ideas and help me on some tech websites references as well. They do it from their homes and they communicate me either in computer chatting or in my mobile phone. For Facebook surfing, I absolutely maintain my website all alone as it is a personal account. But on Facebook, I have lots of friends, relatives and classmates who correspond me online.\n\nI find Facebook to be the most widely used social networking platform and most of my friends, old classmates, and relatives are connected with me. For me, this is the place where I can get updates of all of my friends and people who I care about. In terms of communications and update sharing, Facebook is the best platform and that’s why I use it.\n\nBesides, my blog is an important place for me to write technological and hobby-related information. A blog that has a good number of visitors per day is a great resource for anyone. For me, this is the place to share my knowledge, and for that, I need to read a lot which is very helpful in our professional and personal life. For all these beneficial aspects and the passion I have, I do it often."

    "Answer": "I can potentially enjoy any part of the day, depending on the content of the day.  But I am essentially a night-owl, and as such, I have no hesitation to say that my favourite part of the day is the late-night from 1 am to 3 am when most people are asleep.\n\nNow, if you ask me what I do during that time or how I spend that few hours at late night, I would say that it depends on my mood as well as on what I did during the day time. For example, if it is during the weekdays, and I was really mentally drained out because of a hectic workday, I normally lie down on the bed and listen to some slow music, like soft rock, in order to soothe my mind and body. Sometimes, I also like to read some nice books. On the other hands, if I have a nice day at work and also manage to enjoy my evening with my friends or family members, I watch TV in a rather relaxed mood.\n\nBut, when I say that I watch TV, it doesn’t necessarily mean that I watch any particular programme; rather, I keep myself busy flipping the TV channels one after another in order to check if TV is still interesting as it was in the past. By the way, not sure exactly why I started to consider late night as my favourite part of the day, but I am assuming that it probably has something to do with finishing the extra office works that I couldn’t finish during regular work hours.\n\nAnyway, this late-night is my favourite part of the day, mainly because it allows me to do the things, that I like, at my own pace without being disturbed or distracted by other people around me. Besides, it is during this late-night I feel rather energetic while enjoying the hide-and-seek game of darkness with the light and mother nature."

    "Answer": "Early morning is my favourite part of the day. Though I do not get up early every day, I love the morning time from 5:30 am to 8:30 am.\n\nI often wash my hands and mouth and take a light breakfast at around 6:00 am and then go out for a walk. I usually go to a park and enjoy the fresh air. The environment seems very serene and clean at that time. I often sat beside a lake and enjoy the fishes and birds there. The part of the day I am talking about lasts around 3 hours. When the clock ticks 8:30 am, people start hurrying for the office, school and business places. A lot of cars start moving at that time and the roads become busy and noisy.\n\nThe serenity, freshness and peacefulness that the early morning offers are really charming and exceptional. This is the starting of a new day with new promises and possibilities. I enjoy the sparkle and freshness of the morning and also love the birds, fishes, gardens. To me, this is the most beautiful part of the day. Other parts of a day have their own attractions and beauty but to me, the early morning time is the best and most stunning among them all."

    "Answer": "People say that we can choose our friends but not our neighbours, and I happen to agree with this wholeheartedly. So, having good neighbours is very important, and today, I would like to talk about one such good neighbour I have.\n\nThe name of this good neighbour of mine is Phillip Shetty, and he has been my neighbour for almost 3 years now. In the beginning, of course, I didn’t really know about his exact profession or any other details about him except only that he worked with kids. On the other hands, I didn’t really like to ask him about anything because it was against my principle to poke nose into the business of the people, even though, we meet almost every day.\n\nThen, one day, I found Phillip to be in a rather distressed mode, and so I reluctantly asked him what was bothering him. In response, Phillip told me in a grim face that one of the children had a serious accident the previous day because he was left alone near a busy road unattended, and it was at that time I knew that he works with young children and runs a preparatory school. Anyway, as a neighbour, Phillip seems to be a very considerate person, and he has proved it by not walking his pet dog close to my home after knowing that I am allergic to the pets like cats and dogs. Besides, this neighbour of mine never forgets to remind me that I can ask him for any kind of help. Phillip is a person of little words, but when he talks, he never forgets to smile.\n\nAnyway, I think that Phillip is a good neighbour he never complicates things for a simple neighbour like me. Besides, I also know that I can count on this good neighbour of mine when I would need any help. Finally, I think he is a good neighbour also because he is a hard-working person and hardly ever wastes his time doing unproductive things, like gossiping."

He is an Engineer and works for a large engineering and manufacturing company. He is married and has four children.\n\nHe lives with his family only three blocks away from our house. He moved in our community 5-6 years ago and in this sense, he is my neighbour for the last 5-6 years.\n\nHe is a very amiable and talented person. He speaks very kindly with everybody and with children and senior citizen he behaves very mildly no matter what. I have seen his research papers been published in a reputed science and engineering journal and he is a renowned engineer in our town. In his career life, he is a successful Engineer and in his personal life, he is a good human, doting father and caring husband. He obeys the rules and regulation of our community very strictly and because of that, everyone in our community likes him.\n\nI like him very much because of his kind and benevolent attitude and cordial behaviour. He helps poor people and also boldly protests any discrimination and injustice he notices. His talent, fame and successful career have not made him a proud person. Rather he has become a kind and good-hearted man over time. In our community, most of the people like him and he is, in my opinion, a neighbour anyone would expect to have."

    "Answer": "We all can be sure of one thing in our life and that is “change”. In fact, it is the changes which keep us going in our life, and I think that starting a new job is certainly one such change.\n\nYes, I have recently started a part-time job after graduating from university. But, to tell the truth, before I decided to start a part-time job, I was thinking of starting a second Master’s degree because I have always liked the atmosphere of a university. Besides, I always used to think that the higher qualification had, the better would be my prospect for landing a better employment opportunity.\n\nBut, then one day, one of my friends asked me to visit his uncle’s stock brokerage firm. The reason, of course, was that my friend wanted to buy some stocks, and he wanted me also to buy some stocks for some kind of future financial security. Luckily, I had some money with me at that time, which I saved little by little from my monthly allowance, and I wanted to put them to some good use. So I bought some stocks there and started to visit the firm fairly regularly to see the trend of stock prices. Slowly, slowly, I started to like the stock market, and after a while, I even got very good at anticipating the stock prices. Seeing my skills in understanding future stock prices, my friend’s uncle offered me a part-time position at his firm with a rather handsome salary. Not to mention, since I had already like the stock market, I accepted the proposal, and I must say that the job brought a huge positive change in my life.\n\nAnyway, because of this positive change in my life, I felt like I was becoming very productive in life. Besides, the change also gave me a lot of confidence and positive energy in me where I could see myself very successful in achieving great financial freedom from an early age."

My new job and my lifestyle changes due to that job is very recent and in my opinion pretty significant as well.\n\nSince I joined this company as a Business Executive, I had to make a shift from my student life to corporate life. That was the main reason for the changes I went through.\nDefinitely, that was an important and positive change for my life. I had to join a company or organisation to start my career and I was very glad that I was appointed by a big and prestigious company of the country.\n\nI am no longer a student and I do not have to attend classes and prepare for exams. I am now responsible for the job position I have. Many things have changed including my sleeping pattern and dress-up. I now sleep early and wake up early which were pretty opposite during my student life. I have to maintain office time and follow up my job responsibilities that I was trusted with during my appointment. In fact, I am happy with the changes in my life. I have a great vision and big ambition about my career and now I feel that I am on the right track and I will have to work hard to achieve my future goal. All of those realisations came in my mind after I started working for this company. Besides, now I enjoy economic freedom and that’s a major change as well."

    "Answer": "There is no arguing with the fact that childhood memories are some of the best in our life. Today, I would like to talk about one such memory, involving my mother and a special song. Needless to mention, this particular song has always carried special meaning to me.\n\nThe song, I am talking about, used to be sung by my mother in order to make me fall asleep, and the title of this is “You Are My Sunshine, My Only Sunshine”. Back when I was just a child, I didn’t really know the meaning of this beautiful song. But, now that I am older, I feel like it is one of the best and yet most simple songs about love and loss which certainly evokes people’s memories in different ways, such as happy childhood or just the simple joy of being together with our loved ones.\n\nAnyway, I probably heard this song for the first time at around the age of 5 when I had started to understand the world around me in a bit more certain terms.  I am assuming that I must have been too much energetic and restless back then as a child to keep quiet or just stay at home, and that’s probably why my mother used to sing this song to me in order to calm me down and thus eventually help me fall asleep. Anyway, even people have differed on their opinion as to who actually sang the song first, but the more popular opinion is that Mr Johnny Cash first recorded this song in the year of 1940.\n\nAnyway, this song has a very special meaning to me because it brought me close to my angel mother like nothing else by offering me a sense of immense loving bong and security. It carries a special meaning to me also because it was the first song that I learned to sing as a child when doing any house choirs or just playing along with my friends."

    "Answer": "The song ‘Return to Innocence’ by music band ‘Enigma’ is one of my all-time favourite songs and this song bears a special meaning to me. This song is about human life: the beginning and the end of our lives, the meaning of life, the aim and journey to eternity, and the vision of our life. It signifies the importance of life and how much we should cherish our life. Finally, it is about our journey to another life and life transformation in different stages.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier this is a song by the famous music band ‘Enigma’ and this band is particularly famous for the extraordinary music they produce. I heard this song many years back when I was in my 9th grade. In my birthday one of our relatives gave me a CD of ‘Enigma’ band and then I heard this song. I liked most of the songs on this album but this particular song ‘Return to Innocence’ was bit different and I liked it instantly I heard it for the first time. After that, I heard this song several hundred times and still, this music appears as a new inspiration to me. I believe this would never turn into a lost song for me.\n\nThe brilliant lyrics and extraordinary music of this song soothe my heart each time I listen to it. I can feel this music with every sense of mine and that’s an out-of-the-world feeling. I have found the lyrics pretty rich and meaningful that gave me special meaning about the life we lead. In my stressful and tiresome time this pretty rich and meaningful that gave me special meaning about the life we lead. In my stressful and tiresome time, this particular song has inspired and motivated me many times. This song has become a memory of me. Whenever I listen to this song, I feel a special sensation and that’s why this has a special meaning and strong significance to me."

    "Answer": "I guess that there have been a very few events in my life that have impacted me as deeply and changed my life for better as the grand event of my wedding that took place about a few years ago. Today, I would like to talk about that event as to how it changed my life.\n\nRazia and I got married in a hurry - as much of a hurry as a couple who have been in love with each other for more than 5 years. In March, we decided that we were going to do it in June with a small ceremony at my parents' house. But, instead of June, we had to say “I do” in April (I will tell you why in a minute). So, anyway, we picked out the flowers and our wedding dresses, called a minister, and crammed about 30 people onto some cheap folding chairs in our dining room.\n\nI was about 28 years old back then and wearing just a regular wedding dress (not a very expensive and fancy one). The wedding couldn’t be as low-key as it was without going to some city halls, courthouse or any other wedding venues. Anyway, this marriage wasn’t exactly supposed to take place in such hurry, but things changed when I was offered a great job at a multi-national company, and for that, I would need to live in Europe for at least one year. Obviously, my parents didn’t want me to stay along all these times all by myself in some foreign country, and hence the need to marry me off in such haste.  \n\nAnyway, this wedding event has certainly changed my life for better, mainly because it has provided me with a greater purpose in life which I was missing up and until that grand event. Besides, it also has made me more responsible and confident about my life and future while having the love of my life by my side to share the good times and the bad times together."

    "Answer": "In our lives, we learn everyday knowingly or unknowingly. What we do now shapes our future and every event has its importance and consequence in our life. Yet there are some major and significant events that change our path dramatically. One such important event in my life was helping a neighbour when he got ill severely all of a sudden.\n\nI was passing the neighbour’s house and I heard a noise that sounded more like a scream. In fact, the person got a heart attack and I was only 12 years old at that time to understand that clearly. I ran to his house and when I noticed him lying on the ground, I shouted for help. I called my parents and one of my cousins and we took him to the hospital promptly. The doctor went through the medical treatment and tests and thanked us for being so prompt. The consulting doctor also mentioned that something bad could have happened if we have waited a bit longer to take him to the hospital.\n\nThis person became very grateful to us and also became a family friend. He became a friend, guardian and teacher to me. He often helped me with my studies and taught me many valuable and moral aspects of life.\n\nAfter I passed A level exam, I was accepted by a prestigious Medical College of our country and my father tried to manage a bank loan to support my educational expenses. But he was undone. He had not been able to manage the large amount needed for me to get admitted in this Medical College. This neighbour who became our family friend raised his benevolent support and sold one of his properties to support my education. We tried to protest by all means but he was determined to help. Over the period, my father and I repaid his money but what he did was beyond repayable.\n\nBecause of him, I am a doctor now. That all happened because of the event when I was 12. That event changed the path of my life. This event changed my life for something better and greater."

So, thank you so much for allowing me to describe one such family photograph which I hold so dear to my heart.\n\nThe family photograph, I am talking about here, was taken about 25 plus years ago when I was only about a 9 or 10 years old child. Back in those days, I don’t think that there were any smartphones or digital cameras – not at least where I lived at that time - to take any pictures. So, we either had to invite a professional cameraman at our house or visit a photo studio in order to take any picture except, of course, I wasn’t really that much interested to take any pictures.\n\nRather, I thought that taking pictures was just a waste of time because it would steal a valuable period from my “playtime with friends”. But on that day, my parents were determined to take my picture with them, along with my maternal grandparents and maternal uncles, who were visiting my family after a long time. So, I had no other choices but to wear the new dress and new shoes, which were given to me as some gifts by my grandparents, and pose for the family picture.\n\nBut, as I come to think of it now, I am so glad that I actually posed for that beautiful picture on that bright and sunny afternoon with my grandparents because it reminds me about how fortunate I really was to have such loving grandparents.\n\nAnyway, I remember this family photograph, mainly because it is the only picture where my loving grandparents can be seen together with me and my entire family. Besides, it also reminds me about a time, along with my innocent way of life and thoughts, when I used to enjoy my life to the fullest without worrying about what was going on around me at all."

This photograph was taken when I was only 3 years old and at the 6th marriage anniversary of my parents.\n\nMy father, mother and I were standing in while my grandparents were sitting in front of us in this picture. The picture captured the memory of a very happy family. The time when this picture was taken, I was very little then and I don’t have any particular memory of this event. Back then the camera was very rare in our country and I heard from my mother that a camera man was hired to take the photo of this event. The picture was taken in the garden of our house and my grandparents used to live with us at that moment.\n\nMy grandparents have passed away and this is a revered memory of them. I still look at this picture and feel sad not to have them with us now. I was very little and I still look at me in this photograph with bewilderment. This is the picture that gives me the memory of a happy event, happy family, and innocent me. As I notice this photograph very often at my home, I remember it very well. This is, in fact, the only picture I have of my pre-school age. So this is very important and memorable for me."

Luckily, however, I know a neighbour of mine who likes to support other people, whenever he can, and I am going to talk today about who he is, how I met him, and how often I meet him.\n\nThe name of this neighbour of mine is Raisul Chowdhury. I met Mr Raisul and talked to him for the first time at a super shop in my hometown about a few years ago when he was buying some groceries. Of course, I had seen Mr Raisul, who lives only a few blocks away from me, a number of times before, but I just didn’t have the opportunity to talk to him. In fact, I always used to find him leaving his house hurriedly to either go to his pharmacy shop or his college (I think that he was too active of a person for 50 plus years old since he is a pharmacy owner and a college teacher at the same time). \n\nBut, on that day, when I saw him buying an unusual quantity of groceries, I asked him about what he was going to do with so much grocery. In response, he told me that he was going to donate them to some poor and needy people who lived in the next neighbourhood. Since then, I always used to be the first one to greet him every time I meet him at the weekends, mostly. Later on, I came to know that Mr Raisul offered free medicines also to the people with very limited income on a particular day every week.\n\nAnyway, I have already mentioned above how Mr Raisul likes helps other people directly. But, he likes to help others indirectly also by creating a charity foundation in his town where he doesn’t just donate money himself but also encourages other people around him to do the same. Besides, he never hesitates to ask his neighbours like me if we know anybody who needs any help."

We do not know all the neighbours in our locality and yet I am lucky to have many nice neighbours for their amiable behaviours, sense of responsibilities and benevolent mentality. Among them, Mr Kruse (…or say a name you like…) is a person who frequently extends his helping hand to others. He is a doctor and in fact a very famous one. He is a devoted doctor who often helps people with his service and he has a good reputation as a good and kind doctor. I have noticed many times that he does not impose a fixed fee for the poor patients.\n\nHe has been living in our community for the last 5-6 years and I often meet him in the evening while we both get out for a stroll in the nearby park. I visited his chamber for professional advice regarding the health issue I had and took my family members to him as well. To my surprise, he gave utmost importance to our issues, unlike other doctors we have seen and prescribed some really helpful therapy and medicines.\n\nUsually, the doctors in our city have a tendency to charge a large amount of money to the visiting patients and do not care for the paying capability of the poor patients. But Mr Kruse is an exception to that. With his professional skill and reputation, he could have amassed a fortune for him and for his family but because of his benevolent and kind nature, he is still leading a mediocre but happy life. From my conversation with him, I realised that he puts more priority in helping others than earning money.\n\nHe sometimes even sacrifices his own conform and family needs to visit a patient who can’t come to his chamber. Thus he has sought to help others and that’s a great virtue we do not see very often. In my opinion, he is the most helpful neighbour I have ever had."

Needless to say, they all can be interesting and fascinating in their unique ways even though we may not always understand or recognise them the way we ought to. But, today I would like to talk about one person, whom I recently met, and who I did recognise to be an interesting and captivating person.\n\nThe interesting person, I am talking about, is a fitness trainer and also a sportsperson. His name is Antonio, and I met him at a local gym about a couple of weeks ago.\n\nAnyway, when I met Antonio for the first time, I didn’t really think that he could be such an intelligent and environment-friendly person. But, I was proved wrong when he gave me a long talk about how we were destroying the mother earth by indiscriminately using (he used the word “abusing”) its resources in order to feed our greed. Apart from providing fitness training to people like us, he also likes to play basketball. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention that Antonio likes to read different kinds of books and learn from them.\n\nIn fact, I have seen him reading all kinds of interesting books in between his fitness training sessions. Besides, he also likes to help little children learn about different kinds of physical exercises by visiting them at their schools every once in a while. By the way, he also told me that had been maintaining the same health routine for the last 15 years or so after finishing his university studies. Truly remarkable, isn’t it?\n\nAnyway, I find Antonio to be so interesting because I have felt that even though he seems to have all kinds of resources at his disposal to be someone famous and rich, he didn’t choose that route, simply because he doesn’t like to find happiness in wealth and fame. Instead, he just likes to enjoy his life by doing what he enjoys the most.

He lives a few blocks away from our home and has recently moved to our locality from a different city. He has a family with 4 members and he is an engineering graduate and has worked as a chief engineer in many reputed organisations as he told me. In his early 40’s he took self-retirement and now enjoys his time either in developing some mysterious engineering and scientific tools or by travelling to different places of the world.\n\nIt’s pretty tough to say whether he is planning to visit a new country or has recently come from one if someone meets him. He mostly wears outdated clothes and has long beard with a strange look in his eyes. To my surprise, I found my conversation with him very interesting as he likes to talk about his plan to invent something very important to change the world. I am not sure what he is up to but it seems very thought-provoking to learn that he really believes that. He travels to hills and forests mostly to stay close to nature as he describes this habit to be helpful for idea generation. People often look at him very strangely and do some small talks about his attitude but I find him to be an interesting person. To my surprise, he is a very devoted and a doting father and husband and has a good flow of money even though he does not have a full-time job now.\n\nI met him all of a sudden and that was interesting as well. One day he knocked on my door and I opened it. He came to our house and asked whether I can give him some copper or not. I was pretty perplexed with his sudden appearance and demand for the copper. He told me that he was doing an important experiment and he needs this to carry out his test. I apologised that we do not have any copper to offer him and advised him to visit the nearby shopping complex where he might find it. He returned back after an hour with some bags and thanked me for letting him know where he might find the copper he was looking for. He then offered to visit his house and have dinner with him. The whole confrontation took me by surprise and I understood from that very day that he was bit unusual and interesting in nature."

    "Answer": "There are many historical figures in this world who we know about. But, none of them, in my humble opinion, is as influential in the world of literature and language as William Shakespeare. So, today, I would like to talk about this great historical figure.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was an English poet, playwright, and actor who is/was widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist of all times. He is also often considered as England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\".\n\nEven though it is not known for sure about the exact date on which this extraordinarily-talented writer was born, but the parish register of Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, shows that he was baptized there on April 26, 1564. However, his birthday is traditionally celebrated on April 23.  Anyway, His many works are about life, love, death, revenge, grief, jealousy, murder, magic and mystery. He wrote the blockbuster plays of his day, but some of his most famous are Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet.\n\nIt has been almost 400 years since he died, but people still celebrate his work all around the world. By the way, it is hard to believe but William Shakespeare actually became famous by writing stories in his spare time (yes, again, in his spare time!).\n\nAnyway, talking about the contribution of William Shakespeare, He contributed significantly to the growth of English vocabulary and phrases which have enriched the language, making it more colourful and expressive. Shakespeare's influence on art, literature, language and the vast array of the creative arts has long been known and documented. In fact, he is the most-read playwright in the Western Hemisphere, and the English language is littered with quotes and phrases that originated from his works. Being considered as the author of the most remarkable tragedies and comedies of all time, his plays are also being translated today in over 50 languages and performed across the globe for audiences of all ages. Finally, William Shakespeare is also the inventor of the “iambic pentameter”, a form of poetry that is still widely used today."

    "Answer": "Leonardo da Vinci is one of the most significant persons in world history and he is often considered as the most diversely talented person ever to have lived in human history. His full name was ‘Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci’ and lived from 1452 – 1519 mainly in Italy. He had an incomparable talent and he excelled as a painter, engineer, mathematician, architect, geologist, writer, cartographer, inventor, botanist, sculptor, anatomist, and musician.\n\nHe probably would have been a famous person in history only because of his perfection and talent in art, let along the other talents he had. He was a genius and a second to none figure of Renaissance humanist ideal. The talent, curiosity and logic he presented at his time of living were simply superhuman. His famous painting includes Mona Lisa, The Last Supper, Vitruvian Man, The Creation of Adam and the world now revere these works as the greatest artworks of all time. In many art colleges and institutes, his works are considered to be the model works and grammar for fine work on art. His arts, paintings and notebooks compose a contribution to later generations of artists.\n\nHe is also esteemed for his ingenuity in technology and many of his ideas inspired some later invention in the field of science and engineering. His contribution in technology includes the conceptualization and experiments in solar power, flying machines, armoured vehicles, calculating machine etc. He was a high-class inventor and visionary of science. His other inventions like bobbin winder, optics and hydrodynamics were well ahead of his time. He has great contribution in anatomy, civil engineering and optics as well.   It would require a large volume of books to list down his contributions and talents. He would be revered throughout the history and in my opinion, he is one of most influential and famous historical figure the world has ever seen."

    "Answer": "I have always loved taking long-distance journeys since my high school days. These journeys have allowed me to visit many of my friends – friends whom I met before - in different parts of my country. So, I would just go ahead and talk about one of those journeys which I undertook about a month ago.\n\nBut, before anything else, it is worth mentioning the reasons here as to why or how I could have possibly met so many friends in different parts of my country. Well, the answer is, my father was a government serviceman, and he needed to be stationed in different places all over my country. And, whenever I lived in a new place, it offered me an opportunity to make new friends there before moving to a new place again. Anyway, this had continued for years, but it had to end at a certain point, and it indeed did when my father was eventually retired. On the other hands, of course, my friendship, I already had managed to build with others over the years, didn’t go to retirement. In fact, it remained very much alive and well, as I and my friends kept frequently visiting each other, just as I visited one of them in one of the port cities of my country by train on that occasion.\n\nIt was a good 15-hours long journey, but it certainly didn’t feel that long as it was a very comfortable journey. The services inside the train were great and the seats were of top class, but the best thing about that train journey was that I could fall asleep easily inside it because of its rhythmic motion and movement.\n\nAnyway, on this journey, I managed to spend my time rather well by reading a couple of books, which I always wanted to read. Besides, I also listened to some of my favourite songs on my smartphone in addition to also listening to classical songs, which were being played by the train audio service. Finally, I also enjoyed a few small but great snacks which were offered by the designated catering service there."

    "Answer": "I visited India 2/3 years back and at that time I took a journey from Kolkata to New Delhi and then back to Kolkata on the next day. This was indeed a very long journey compared to the usual journey I have had. It was probably March 2012 when I went to India to meet a colleague. I went to Kolkata to meet him and then an emergency appeared to get back to my embassy in New Delhi.\n\nFrom the Kolkata train station, I booked a seat in an express train and started my journey alone. It took me more than 26 hours to reach New Delhi train station and after finishing my task at the embassy I took a train again to get back to Kolkata.\n\nThe main transportation I used was express train and apart from that I had to take a taxi and local tram during this journey. After I took my seat on the train I started reading a book I had with me. After few hours I went to the lunch boggy to have my lunch and there I met a person from my country. He was a photojournalist and we had a long conversation. I slept on the train at night and listened to the music in my iPad. I bought some local English magazines and read interesting stuff. In the next morning I reached New Delhi station and from there I went to my embassy. I finished my tasks there and get back to another train to Kolkata. On my way back, I watched the villages and people the train was passing and took many photos that I instantly updated on my blog. Apart from the long hour’s journey and being alone in the whole journey, I enjoyed the trip."

    "Answer": "I think that nothing really excites and motivates us as much as the good childhood memories or the memories when we were young. I also have many of such great memories when I was a young child. So, today, I would love to recall one of those great memories from my childhood when my parents took me to a new town which I never visited before.\n\nIf my memory serves me well, I was about 8 years old back then when I was taken to that town. At that age, I think that, I had just started to learn about the world around me on an intellectual level which also meant that I wanted to travel to new places and learn about new things. So, when I heard that a new planetarium theatre was opened in that town, where I would be able to see the night sky as well as the stars and the other things on it, I requested my parents to take me there. But, unfortunately, my parents were busy people, and they just couldn’t take me to any place whenever I would have liked it. So, after waiting for a significant period of time, my parents finally managed to make some time for me in order to visit that planetarium on a weekend.\n\nBy the way, I must have thanked my parents thousand of times for taking me in that beautiful town in a train, instead of a boring bus, because they knew how much I really enjoyed a train journey.\n\nAnyway, I must say again that I really enjoyed visiting that planetarium and the town that was hosting the theatre, mainly because I was able to see so many beautiful things in that town. Its beautiful street lights, nice restaurants, large shopping centres – all looked just so fabulous and colourful to my young and inexperienced eyes. Besides, I felt that I could actually touch the sky from all those tall buildings in that town just as I felt that I could touch the beautiful sky and its stars when I was enjoying the show in the planetarium."

    "Answer": "When I was 17 years old, my parents took me to a relative’s house and I learned that this was a particular relative who saved my life when I was only 6. Since I was deeply touched by the event and the person, I still remember this event and my time there. It was in (…say a place in…), a nearby village of my grandparents’ house that I never knew about. One day my parents asked me to go visit a relative’s house when we were in my grandparent’s house. I went with them and on our journey, we took a local bus and finally a boat to reach the place. To my surprise, I was standing in front of an old house and my parents took me inside the house where I saw a very old woman. She was almost 70 years old and was lying in her bed. My mother introduced me to her and told me a story that I will never forget.\n\nShe told me that, one day I went swimming in a pond with one of my cousins when I was around 6 years old without informing anyone of my family. They were busy on other tasks and that’s why did not notice two of us silently escaped from home and went to that pond to swim though we did not know how to swim at that early age. There we were slipped from the sloppy corner of the pond and directly fall into the deep water. According to my mother’s story, no one was around except an old woman who noticed us struggling in the water and she risked her life to save two of us.\n\nIn fact, my parents took me to meet that particular woman who was counting her days. That was such a touchy story that I could not restrain my tears at that age. I looked at the soft eyes of that old woman and felt like I was looking at my survivor. Later on, I heard that my father raised his helping hand to this particular woman for many years and showed his gratitude towards her.\n\nMy parents took me many places in my childhood and adolescence time but to me, that was the most mysterious and touchy place I have been with them."

    "Answer": "I can think of a number of important days in my life, and all of them, I am sure, have affected my life in one way or another. But, I think that none of them had any far-fetching effect on my life as the day when my father left our home country to work in another country before about 15 years.\n\nI believe that the day was the 21st of September when my father left the country, leaving me to wonder about the future of our little family which included me, my mother and my little sister. At that time, I had just started high school, and so I didn’t really have much idea about the real world around me.\n\nBefore that day, of course, my father was the one who always used to take care of the whole family just like a good family provider. From taking my little sister to her school to doing grocery shopping to paying all kinds, everything used to be managed by my mother. On that other hand, I was just like any other regular child of my age who loved to play with his friends all the time without having to worry about anything around him.\n\nSo, before leaving the country, when my father told me to behave and take care of our family, I got a bit overwhelmed because I just didn’t know what to do without my father. But, as time passed, I started to act like an adult by becoming more responsible. Besides, I also show started to show more awareness about what was going on around me as opposed to what I did before my father had left. Suddenly, I realized that getting separated from my father had a positive effect on my life.\n\nAnyway, the day when my father left the country was an important day in my life because it taught me how to behave and act like an adult at a very young age. Besides, it also taught me that we should all appreciate the value of each and every family member of ours while they are among us."

    "Answer": "My first day at my university is an important day for me. That was so much enchanting and inspiring for me that, it became one of the most memorable events in my life. I consider this day to be a very important day in my life because of its significance to shape my future.\n\nI got admitted to an Engineering University of my country where mostly rich people send their kids to study. I was enrolled in this university because of my academic record and is one of the merit listed students. It was 2006 and I went to my university on 12th January. I noticed that most of the students were dropped by their parents and I was very few of the students who had to take a shared bus to reach the university campus.\n\nI went to stroll around the campus as it was the orientation day and no classes were scheduled for that day. All of a sudden I found myself talking to me and I was taking some oaths myself. One of those oaths was that studying would be the topmost priority for the next 5 years of my life. I was also determined that I would not get involved in a kind of politics and riot groups and would solely focus to make an impressive academic record. I visited the library, labs, classrooms, auditoriums and all those massive and beautiful constructions and facilities inspired me a lot. In fact, his was the day when the realisation hit me that I have a good opportunity ahead of me and I have to devote myself to grab this opportunity as much as possible. In terms of the significant determination, I gathered that day, it was, in fact, a very positive day for me. Very few moments and events stirred me so much to take this short of self-vow and oaths to change the future."

I would like to tell you about an important day in my life, why I consider it as an important day, what exactly happened, who were with me, how old I was then, how I felt and why I still remember that day.\n\nI am 28 years old now and working in a financial institution as an assistant manager. I love my work and have no plan to switch to this sector. To me, one of the most important days of my life was the day I got admitted to my university. Just after I finished my A-level study, I thought to do my graduation majoring Finance or a relevant commerce subject. I guess I was 18 years old when I got admitted in the (...say university name...). I consider this day was quite vital as it determined many future events and aspects in my life. The current job I have, the possible future career I will have, the way I will lead my professional life and many other important aspects of my life were heavily influenced and affected by the day I got admitted to the university and the major field of study I picked. From this perspective, I consider it a very important day in my life.\n\nEarly morning on that day, I got up at 6.00 am my father took me to the university. I waited for approximately half an hour before I was called to face the interview board. After a thorough discussion, they asked me which major I would like to take. My options were finance, marketing and business studies. I was already determined to take finance as I let the professors know my choice. They congratulated me and asked whether I have bought necessary papers for the admission. I told them \"Yes, I am ready and have bought all the necessary papers for my admission.\". Then I thanked them for the opportunity they gave me and my interview was complete. Then I went to the admission office of the university to complete my admission process. This whole time my father was with me. We had our lunch outside and returned home at 3.30 pm.\n\nThe whole morning I felt very anxious about my admission. When I finished my admission process and got my favourite subject as the major, O felt quite relieved. After lunch, I walked a few blocks inside the university campus and I was very happy and excited at that time.\n\nI noticed that my father was also very happy after he heard from me that I am now allowed to get admitted. He did not look relaxed in the early morning and I am sure he too was anxious about my admission to the university. I will never forget this very special day as it was the day for a paradigm shift in my life."

    "Answer": "Sometimes, I really wonder why we celebrate on losing a complete year of our life. But, then again, at the same time, I also think about the gift of life which is given to us in the form of an additional year. And, the gift of this additional year is certainly worth celebrating just like I celebrated my 22nd birthday.\n\nMy 22nd birthday was indeed special because that year I finished my university studies. Besides, my parents also had finally decided to allow me to go and live in a big city so that I could find my dream job. All in all, things looked good for me, and so when some of my friends insisted that my 22nd birthday would need to be celebrated in a special manner, I had to agree with them. \n\nAfter that, we all agreed that we would celebrate the birthday at a top-class hotel in town except, of course, I didn’t have enough money to pay the charge. Luckily, all of my friends decided to chip in to share the cost, and we were all set to celebrate my 22nd birthday in a grand style. We hired one of the famous music bands in my country to entertain us. I also decided to invite my most favourite university teachers in addition to all of my friends to join the party.\n\nThe party started around 9:00 pm and continued until midnight. But, we all enjoyed the party so much that we forgot about the time. The food and snacks were great and the music was very stimulating. And as for the birthday gifts, I don’t think that I had ever had so many of them in my life before!\n\nAnyway, I remember the birthday so well because all of my friends attended it. Besides, the congratulatory speech from my favourite teacher from the university was the best motivational speech that someone has ever given to me. That birthday made me feel that indeed how blessed and lucky I really was to have so many well-wishers around me."

But my friends planned to surprise me on my birthday and also asked my parents and siblings to join them on that day.\n\nI went outside at around 9 pm.

I was bit confused as I had no preparation for that and I felt a bit lost about the whole event.\n\nWhen the clock ticked to 12.01 am, my friends started unfurling their surprises for me and that included a four-storied cake, numerous gifts and music festival. I enjoyed this birthday occasion thoroughly and to my surprise, my friends invited some of their cousins as well.\n\nI was mostly speechless and continuously thanked my friends for the great preparation they did for my birthday celebration. I spent the night with my friends, we watched a movie late at night and finally, I went to sleep in the early morning.\n\nThis is a very surprise party for me and the friends I was talking about taking a great burden to arrange everything to celebrate this occasion. They even invited my parents and siblings so that they can also be part of the whole celebration. It was quite a different birthday celebration for me and I remember it very well. The gifts that I got on that were very expensive including Kindle Fire, iPod, Gymnasium instrument and many other gifts. I was very much touched by the whole event and it took me by surprise. That is why this has become a part of my memory and I can recall the whole event very clearly."

Yes, my little cousin just loved going to a children park except, of course, his parents were too busy to take him there most of the time. So, when I visited him last year because I was on a vacation, he didn’t want to waste the opportunity to drag me to a children’s park.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, I never really visited a children’s park before so I just didn’t know what I was expecting in a children’s park except that there were some activities to entertain the children. Of course, I tried to tell that to my little cousin but he was too much optimistic of a character as he was certain that I would also enjoy the children’s park, I was visiting, just like him.\n\nAnd, he was right to some extent because I was indeed happy to see him enjoying his time while he was riding the merry go round, roller coasters, Ferris wheels, swing boats and other things. However, I noticed that out of all those rides, my little cousin enjoyed the ride on the land train the most. Anyway, seeing my cousin so delighted, it was worth capturing the rare moments of fun, so I took my smartphone out and took some of his pictures while in action.\n\nOh, by the way, I also had to buy my little, 8 years old cousin some snacks and ice creams to provide him with the much-needed energy to carry on with his fun activities.\n\nAnyway, I went to visit the park, primarily because I didn’t want to see my little, innocent cousin sad. After all, he didn’t like anything else as much as visiting a children’s park, and I just didn’t want to be the one to spoil that fun. Besides, I also wanted to get some first-hand experience of visiting a children’s park myself since I had nothing better to do at that time."

    "Answer": "There always are areas in our lives, be it at our home or office, in which we can bring some innovations. But, we don’t really go for such improvements because they seem to be difficult. However, with the right ideas and approach, we can always bring such developments, and today, I would like to talk about one such idea which, I think, would bring some much-needed improvements at my work.\n\nAnyway, there are many things at my work which I can really be proud of, but as far as, the team works among the staffs and co-ordination across the different departments are concerned, I don’t really think that much is really going on to make us proud. Apparently, all the mid-level and junior level employees at my company think that their own departments, in which they work, are more important than other departments. So, as a junior staff of my company, who hardly has anything to lose, I have decided to put forth a proposal to the upper management which would make it mandatory for all the staffs to work at every department for at least 2 working days in rotation every month so that they all understand the value of everybody’s efforts and works. I have got this idea from one of the senior brothers’ companies which had almost the same kind of issue. I know that it won’t be that easy to implement this idea it would force them to change (and change is what everybody “hates” at work) their daily routines in a significant way, but it’s worth the shot.\n\nI think that the idea would bring some positive change in my workplace mainly because everybody will be treated fairly and equally in this scheme. Besides, in this way, I also believe that since all staffs would be able to try something new or new activities/works at least a couple of days per month, they would be able to break free from the monotonous work schedules at least for some times."

    "Answer": "Since I am a student and have never worked for a company, my idea is related to the college where I study. Engaging two teaching assistants for each class is an idea that would very positively improve the study environment and facility in our college/ university. It is a large college with more than seven thousand students. Each class has more than 40 students and not all of them are equally talented and focused on the lessons. So if the college authority arranges to enrol two promising and talented students who have the capability to manage the classes and assist the teachers in explaining lessons to other students, would be a great aid for all the students who often struggle to understand the lessons but do not ask questions to the teachers. In fact, that would be a great initiative by the college administration to help all the students with their lessons. I got the idea from a website of a renowned university that explained how they enrol teaching assistants and this process helps all the students of a class.\n\nI do not think it would be very difficult to implement. The college authority needs to discuss this whole idea and then finally decide the process. That might require some administrative and decision level meeting. The extra budget that would be required would not be a big hassle for the college to support. So, in my opinion, I do not see any major obstacles to implementing this idea.\n\nFrom my experience, I can say that only one-third of the whole students in a class can catch and fully understand the lectures delivered by the teachers. The remaining two-third students of a class neither understand the lessons nor ask questions to the teachers to explain things again. Many students do not ask the questions they have directly to the teachers and thus always remain as the back-benchers. If they get teaching assistants from their classmates, they would surely raise their questions to those TA and would be greatly benefitted. The overall study quality would improve and the results of the college would also improve dramatically."

    "Answer": "The idea of trying different kinds of food from different continents or cultures has fascinated me since the day I started to learn about this beautiful world and its people around me. But, then there are some food items which I would like to try more than others, and today I would like to talk about one such foreign food that stands out from the crowd of other food.\n\nThe name of this foreign food is “Japanese okonomiyaki”. It is a Japanese pancake which is full of authentic flavours and textures, with fresh squid or prawns along with a “mirin” and a particular kind of honey sauce. It is a special dish that is perfectly garnished with bonito flakes. By the way, “okonomiyaki” means “cooked or grilled as you like it”.\n\nIn many other countries in the world, this delicious dish is also known as “Japanese Pizza” because it looks a lot like a regular pizza except it contains different ingredients. Anyway, one may want to describe it, but in reality, it is actually nothing but an iconic Japanese street food which is primarily made from shredded cabbage, flour, eggs and water. By the way, I learned about this foreign food when I was watching some food network TV channel about a few months ago.  Later on, I searched on the internet also to learn more about this Japanese food which also has become very popular in many other countries around the world like the USA, Europe and other Asian countries.  However, even though, this food is widely popular around the world, it is mostly prepared and consumed in Japan.\n\nI want to try this iconic Japanese street food, mainly because it is loaded with pretty much all kinds of vitamins, proteins and carbohydrate. Apart from that, I also want to try it because I want to understand what kind of taste it really has, and, on what occasions, I can serve this particular food for my friends and guests when we are celebrating something. Finally, I want to try it because the decoration of this food looks so classy."

I will tell you what it is, how I learned about it, where it is mostly eaten and explain why I want to taste it so badly.\n\nThe food is…. Pizza!  Now, of course, this is a food that you can buy all over the world, and I really enjoy the pizza that I can buy in my home country which is England in the UK.  However, I recently learned from a friend that the style of pizza available here is nothing like the authentic Italian pizza you can get if you visit its country of origin, and since then, it’s one of the things on my bucket list.  That is, something I’d like to do before I die is to travel to Italy, find a local pizzeria and get a really authentic pizza.\n\nSo how did I learn what I’ve been missing?  I shop regularly at a local family-owned delicatessen.  The proprietor is Italian, and he is a great foody – that is he takes food very seriously, sourcing only the best ingredients. He and his wife are both vegetarian like me, so they often suggest food or recipes.  The other day we were talking and he was bemoaning the lack of ‘proper’ pizzas in this country.  He told me that whilst of course, Italian food is very regional including its pizzas, they are nevertheless distinctive.  All pizzas MUST be cooked in a wood-fired oven for a start, the dough should be tossed by hand.  The pizza should only be made with the very freshest and finest ingredients, and is best eaten outdoors too, of course, against the backdrop of the Italian countryside!\n\nPizza is eaten everywhere in Italy, though of course approximations of pizza can be bought the world over.  Even so, my deli friend has persuaded me I’ve been missing out, and I’d like to find out for myself how different it might taste if I go for an authentic recipe, venue and location.  I’ve never had a real pizza, and I’ve never been to Italy either, I think it would be a winning combination – not to mention that it would also be a great excuse to go to a beautiful country that I have yet to visit.  What do you think, would you like to come too?"

    "Answer": "I would like to try the Salmon fish with onion and olive oil which is a foreign menu for the people of our country. In our country, we do not have the Salmon fish and the finest quality olive oil is imported from Italy. The exotic menu I have mentioned is available only in a five-star hotel in our country. If I get the opportunity someday, I will try this food item.\n\nI learned about this item from a lifestyle & travel related TV channel a few years ago. I was randomly checking the programs of different channels and I noticed this TV channel. The cook described in details how to prepare this food item, what ingredients would be required, how to make it tastier and I watched it all with utmost interest and attention. A few years later I found this menu in a billboard beside a big hotel in our city and at that time I planned to have it. Since it is a foreign food item and available only in this luxurious and expensive hotel, it would be quite expensive for me.\n\nAfter watching the TV program on cooking, I got interested in this food. Apart from that, I heard that Salmon fish is very tasty. The way the TV program presented it was very impressive and extraordinary. This program and their way of cooking grabbed my interest and attention. I would like to taste it mostly because I watched it in a TV program and heard that this is a menu worth trying."

    "Answer": "Bringing back childhood memories is probably one of the sweetest things in our life as an adult. I also have many of such sweet childhood memories that I like to recall from time to time, and this cue card topic is asking me to do just that by allowing me to remember one of my most favourite songs from those golden old days.\n\nThis is, of course, a Bengali movie song with the title “ekdin chuti hobe, onek dure jabo”, meaning “ we will have our holidays one day from our school and then we will travel far far away”, and the song is taken from an old but very famous movie called “Chutir Ghontha” (Holiday Hours).\n\nIncidentally, this was a very popular song at a time when I also was studying at an elementary school. In fact, the song was so popular back then that our radio would play it at least 10 times a day.  Besides, it was for the first time that my parents sent me to watch a movie after enjoying this particular song so much.\n\nAnyway, this song goes to a great length in describing the activities of children in a very exotic and nice manner, which they enjoy after their schools are closed for holidays.  At one point, this song even talks about a beautiful world, free of all kinds of sorrows and sufferings, for the children which would be full of many beautiful fairies, playing with the children. By the way, I still remember the days very vividly when my elder sister sang this song to me from time to time, in order to cheer me up, when I felt down.\n\nI still remember this song, primarily because it was very much related to my happy childhood which I would like to enjoy as a young student. Besides, I remember it also because it had a very nice rhyme and tune for my taste and liking as a child. Finally, I specifically remember this song also because I was told that it was taken from a movie, based on a true story."

    "Answer": "My mother often sang me a lullaby titled \"Oh my sweet angel look the Moon has come to play with you…” in my bedtime and I have heard it so many times in my childhood that I can still remember it very vividly. This was a song usually famous in the rural area of our country that mothers often use to soothe the baby and to send them to sleep. It was an 8-10 lines song with great harmony and the way my mother sand it was extraordinary. It still echoes in my head and I miss those days.\n\nI can remember my mother often sand this song till I got admitted in the school and I heard it from my father as well in my bedtime. I was pretty touched by the lyrics and in my childhood, I often imagined that the verses used in this song were true and would happen to me as well.\n\nWe often remember things from childhood especially the stories or songs we hear with great enthusiasm. This song was no exceptions. I heard it hundreds of times and as a child, I fanaticized those things to be true. Thais is the main reason I still remember it. Maybe, someday when I will become a father/ mother, I will sing thins song to my children as well. This has in fact become a permanent memory and I still love the great and calming piece of music."

    "Answer": "Somewhere I heard or read that walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light. And, I must say that I fully agree with the statement. Indeed, friends are important because they always somehow affect us. Today, I would like to talk about one such friend who has played an important part in my life.\n\nHis name was Fazle Rabbi, and he was my university friend. I met him for the first time at our university cafeteria about 7 years ago when we both were waiting on a line to pay for our coffee.\n\nHe asked me if I was coming from a certain part of my county as I was talking in a different dialect, and I said that he was right in his assumption. After that casual conversation, our friendship had started, and we are continuing our friendship still to this date Anyway, both I and Fazle were in the same year of our university, but Fazle was studying a different subject.\n\nAfter we started our friendship, Fazle had helped me with a number of things, which included collecting class notes for me from his friends and taking me to the hospital when I was sick. Sometimes, he even offered me to use his bicycle to reach the university library on a cold evening. Even though we were just friends, we treated each other like a brother. By the way, I had a bad habit of smoking, and it was Fazle who finally convinced me to quit smoking. Fazle even took a very innovative approach to force me to follow a particular study routine, which ultimately had helped me to get a very good final grade, when leaving university.  \n\nAnyway, Fazle has influenced my life in a tremendous manner, but I think that he played his most important role as a friend when he encouraged me to choose teaching as a profession instead of becoming a public health professional. In fact, it is because of my friend Fazle that I have such a fulfilling career today."

    "Answer": "I always consider myself to be extremely lucky to have many close friends who have raised their helping hands in times when I desperately needed. Thus I have many real friends who are not only friends in good times but also for bad times. One such friend is Ricardo who helped me greatly and his contribution to my life has placed him in an important and special position in my life.\n\nThis was the time when I was a fresher in my college and I became acquainted with Ricardo. Our friendship grew deeper with time and we became very close friends. In my second year, I got involved in a local group and I was mostly interested in their theatre performance. I never knew they were indirectly involved in politics and were funded by the major political party of our city. When I got suspicious of this group’s activity I submitted my resignation and then the real dilemma started. They would not allow me to leave intentionally and started showing me how much they have already done for me. Somehow I did not care and left this group. After a few months, the group was accused of doing political vandalism and an act against the law and I got trapped. As they have not permitted me officially to resign, I was shown as an active member of this group. I was quite in trouble as my college authority took it as a serious threat towards their disciplinary rules and they started interrogating me.\n\nIn fact, I had no big connections and influences to get out from this trap and my friend Ricardo came to save me from this ploy with every connections and influence he had. I knew him merely for only 2 years at that time and to my surprise, he did everything humanly possible to save me from the disgrace.\n\nIn fact, because of his help and advice, I had been able to save myself from an unexpected danger and disgrace. Even the college authority would not have listened to me if he had not been there for me. Thus he has saved me from a disastrous experience I might have to face. After that, I started feeling immense gratitude towards him and consider his help as an important part of my life."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this nice topic. I really appreciate the time you have allowed me to think about this topic and then describe it to you.\n\nWell, for this candidate task card, I am going to talk about one of my friends from childhood and her name is Geetha. She was one of the closest friends to me and also a classmate, and her home was adjacent to my house. We are friends from my adolescent and we are still close friends.\n\nI still remember our first meeting in our childhood very lucidly. One day on the playground while practising badminton, I saw her and at that time, we were studying in standard ten; that was 10 years ago, to be more accurate.  She had an aura of friendliness and a great personality, even in her tender and young age. We talked for a while, played badminton together for an hour and discovered that she lives in my area, next door, to be more precise. They have recently moved to this area and I was glad to have met her. We are still very good friends and we remain in touch with each other despite our busy schedule these days.\n\nShe had a distinctive personality and a great smile that would give a friendly gesture to others. I have scarcely seen any other with such attractive personality at our age. She has such \"good qualities\" and I was lucky to have a friend like her. She always encouraged me to participate in different sports and games and it would not be an exaggeration if I say that I would have discontinued playing badminton without her motivation and inspiration. She was a great badminton player and had a natural talent for it. She was caring, helpful and a  great mentor.\n\nI revere our memory together in our school and she was one of the top scorers in our class despite her passion for many other things including sports. Every year our school used to organise sports day - a day when all interested pupils would take part in different sporting competitions and parents and teachers would be invited to witness the competition. I had been intimidated by the arrangements of this big sporting event and did not have enough skill sets to win any prize until Geetha paired with me. She encouraged me and practised about 2 hours in the evening daily.  With time I overcame my fear and became a better player with her courage, tips and help. Interestingly in a year, we became the winning team and that was possible due to her great contribution to my improvement. I was really over the moon on the night and thanked her or her help. My parents were happy as I was progressing with my academic studies as well.\n \nSo my friend is the person who has influenced very positively in my life and I will never forget her. Friends are like smiles in our face and a good friend is a heavenly gift. Geetha was such a good friend, she still is, and I hope our friendship continues forever."

    "Answer": "Different people have different types of short term goals. Some want to save up some money to buy a luxury car while others want to travel to a few countries. Well, I also have a short term goal and that is to set up a workout routine for doing some daily physical exercise.\n\nWell, I have been carrying this thought inside my head that I would need to work on my physical fitness for almost a year, but I haven’t managed to do it yet either because I have been too lazy or I have been too busy.\n\nBut, the time has certainly come to become a bit more serious about my health and fitness, mainly because I am spending plenty of time at my office which is making me gain weight. After all, sitting on a chair for a significant part of the way without any physical activity, in the long run, is a recipe for disaster as far as your health is concerned, especially, if you are not strictly controlling your diet.\n\nBesides, my age is also not on my side because the older I become, the more difficult will it get to get rid of the extra weight I gain. At least, my doctor thinks so when he suggests getting rid of my extra weight.\n\nAnyway, I know that setting up this workout routine is not going to be easy because I am not exactly a very organized person. Besides, the responsibilities and the current work schedules I have at my job won’t exactly allow me to set a fixed workout routine unless I become more aggressive and innovative about it.\n\nAnyway, in order to set up this workout routine, first I need to cut my nap time as well as my regular sleep time, if possible. Then I would also need to cut the time that I sometimes use for socialising purpose with my friends. Besides, I would also need to be more efficient at my work so that I don’t have to spend too much time on a certain task or assignment."

We all have long term and short term goals in our lives and we dream to achieve them all. One of the short time goals or should I say ambition I currently have is to migrate to Canada/ UK/ USA/ Australia and settle there for a couple of years.\n\nI have finished my graduation in M.B.A from a reputed university in my country and then worked for 2 years in a multinational company. The valuable experience I gather during these 2 years would be very helpful for me to further enhance my career. In the meanwhile, if I can work for a company situated in a first world country that fosters multi-cultural work environment and deals with top-notch businesses, would be a great uplift for my future.\n\nI have decided to fulfil this goal 1 year ago and then started working accordingly. In fact, the IELTS exam I am participating in was a part of my preparation to requirement fulfilment to achieve this goal.\n\nSo far I have been doing fine to be allowed to migrate to the country I have targeted, but yet nothing is certain. I am hopeful that I would be able to fulfil all the criteria I am required to complete to be allowed to go there.\n\nIn my country the working and training experience in a first world country is esteemed greatly and to participate in our economy, I need to learn the business ethics and idea from a country which is considered to be a pioneer in it. This is the main reason I would like to go and work there. Apart from that, it would allow me to enhance my knowledge, experience and would broaden my horizon which would be very much beneficial for my future."

    "Answer": "I have never really cared about the type of workplace I work in. Instead, I have thought that we should try our best to fit in all kinds of working environments by having a strict professional mindset. However, after visiting the office of one of my close friends, I had to change my mind about fitting in. So, what exactly made me change my mind?\n\nWell, first of all, the office, in which my friend works, is spacious enough to ensure collaboration among its staffs, without the need of shouting to each other, also allows to be mindful about the privacy of the fellow co-workers. On each corner of the office, yes, exactly on each corner, there is a large balcony with sofa chairs in them so that any number of staffs can go there at any time and speak their minds and have fun without distracting others. \n\nBesides, the entire office floor is perfectly decorated with real flower plants to create a natural effect on the minds of all the staffs so that they think that they are not just working in an office but also relaxing among nature. By the way, the windows of the office are designed and created in such a way that natural light can enter the office until the sun goes down. And as far as the natural air is concerned, I don’t think I have seen any office which is designed so masterfully to let its employee enjoy it while also watching the leaves of the plants, inside the office, moving at the same time.\n\nAnyway, this is the best workplace, I have ever seen, in its simplest form. To be honest, I wouldn’t mind working in this kind of workplace even if I am paid less than the salary I am getting now because I am sure that nobody would really get tired of working in this kind of office environment. Besides, I also like the fact that everybody, including the company chairman, has easy access to everybody in this kind of office which makes it really unique."

I worked on the 3rd floor and the office was pretty neat and friendly for the employees. The cubicles were large enough and the friendly environment of this office gave a very positive impression of this company. There were many foreigners and local employees there and most of them were a business consultant, admin and team leads. I personally worked with a team who were specialised in data mining and database designing. There were many software engineers who were engaged in developing software.\n\nI knew about his office from a bulletin board of my university that offered different important noticed for the students and faculty. I noticed the job offer and was interested in it. Since I worked for this company for more than 8 months; I know it from my first-hand experience.\n\nTo me, this was an ideal working environment that maintained a good balance among the working environment, facilities and options for recreations and study. A whole floor was dedicated to the library and reference works which are really rare for many companies. To surmise, I found it to be a very pleasant and friendly workplace where employees are self-motivated to work for the company."

    "Answer": "This is such an interesting topic because, frankly speaking, since I entered the professional life, I have always thought of each day as a workday because it seems to me every day I have something from my work to deal with. But, still, I will try my best to describe one of my typical days when I am not working or not in the mindset of working.\n\nWell, whether I am working or not, I always like to wake up early in the morning before the sun rises. After waking up from sleep, the first thing I do is to offer my prayer, followed by going out for a morning walk. But, if I feel that the weather is good and my body and mind are cooperative enough, I actually start running instead of walking. \n\nHowever, after coming back home from my morning adventure with the mother nature, I take a shower and finish my breakfast. Then I either spend some times, talking with the other members of my family or watching some programmes on TV that I like. When afternoon arrives, I sometimes visit a shopping centre to buy something or do some window shopping, but if I am not visiting the shopping centre, I am either going to my favourite café to enjoy some fresh coffee or just hangs out with my friends while discussing the contemporary issues. At night, I enjoy my dinner with all my family members and again watch some TV before going to bed. By the way, such a typical day is certainly different from a workday because I don’t really have to worry about appeasing or satisfying others as I have on a workday.\n\nAnyway, I certainly like my typical day and try to enjoy it as best as I can, knowing that each day of our life is a blessing from the Lord almighty.   Besides, this type of typical day allows me to rediscover myself and my passion anew so that I am able to know what things are important in life and what is not."

When I do not have classes or approaching exams, I try to spend my time is ease and relaxation so that I can get refreshed and recharged.\n\nOn one such day, I get up late from sleep and after that, I take a good breakfast. I then take a shower and go to the shopping malls to purchase my necessary stuff. Since I do not get time every day, I do my shopping on my free days.\n\nI watch movies or TV serials till noon and try to eat outside with friends in the evening. Sometimes I make plans to hang around with my friends at their places and take my dinner in a restaurant. In the evening after I get back home, I either read a novel or watch movies.\n\nHanging with friends, watching movies, listening to music, internet surfing and spending time with family members are the main enjoyment I have during my typical free days. Such a day is quite different from my other typical days as I do not go to my university, do not read for 4-5 hours a day or even do not spend time for approaching exams. In my opinion, such days are important to get relieved from the monotonous routines and scheduled life.\n\nI really enjoy such days as I do not have much hurry to do everything. I enjoy spending time with my family members and friends. I enjoy the relaxing mood I can possess during my free days."

Of course, it can’t also be denied that not all of us are meant and programmed to shoulder the burden of such huge responsibilities, but those, who do, certainly deserve our admiration and applause. Today, I would like to talk about one such person who I admire and respect because of handling a lot of responsibilities.\n\nThe person, I am talking about, is my eldest cousin. Even though he is a significantly elder person than me, I have seen him from very close how he handles all those responsibilities, he has, at ease. First of all, he is a medical doctor by profession. Now, being a medical doctor alone itself is a huge responsibility since he has to treat a lot of patients, some of who are seriously ill, on a regular basis. On top of that, he also is an elected public official in our local city government where he has to meet a lot of people on a regular basis to talk about the issues and problems which affect our city.\n\nNow, if you add all of these responsibilities, he has to deal with almost every day, to the fact that he also has to run an orphanage of almost 200 little children by looking after their food, education and health issues on a daily basis, you can’t really help but think of him as a “superhuman”.  But, of course, he is no superman, but rather he is just a regular man just like us who has lots of energy and a good heart to do good things for other people.\n\nAnyway, sometimes I really wonder how possibly my cousin handles so many responsibilities together. Then I figured out that he knows how to manage his time perfectly. Besides, I also think that since he is a medical doctor himself, he just knows how to remain physically and mentally fit all the times."

However, while all of these tourist destinations are unique in their own merits, I would venture to say that the Taj Mahal is class apart for so many reasons. So, today, I would like to go ahead and talk about this one of the 7th wonders in the world.\n\nWell, so many things have been told about this architectural marvel for centuries, and yet its appeal hasn’t diminished a bit. In fact, if anything, its appeal as one of the most unique and sought-after tourist attractions among the world tourists has only increased day by day.\n\nAnyway, located in the major city of Agra in the Uttar Pradesh region around the 17th century, this fantastically unique and monumental archaeological site has attracted all kinds of people from all over the world many, many years as if the Taj mahal was created for the sole purpose of erasing all kinds of visible and invisible boundaries among the world citizens in one common cause and that is to witness the gift and proof of unconditional love of a husband for his loving wife. But, did Emperor Shah Jahan could ever imagine how his creation would once mesmerize the entire world when he started to build it? Or could he even think that his love story would live to wow the love bugs and ordinary citizens of the world alike for centuries? Well, we can’t know the answer to these questions for sure, but one thing is for sure that there won’t be another Taj mahal even in the next thousand years.\n\nAnyway, different people would talk about the main attractions of the Taj mahal in different ways, but if I am asked, I would say that the massively-reflecting pool inside it, which stunningly creates the mirage of Taj mahal, is simply spectacular. Besides, its arch and dome, carved with semiprecious stones, carry the painstaking details of craftsmen so meticulously that it is just unmatchable to any craftsmen works which we can see in these modern days."

    "Answer": "In the age of new electronic gadgets and technology, one may not find much use for an obsolete thing called “pen” at work, or for that matter anywhere, but I have always considered a pen as a symbol and intellect and knowledge. Needless to say, I also find my pen as a handy tool to help me with my work.\n\nSo, how important really is a pen? Well, we will be able to understand its importance if we look back to the history of civilization. Anyway, we should have no doubt in our mind that one of the hallmarks of our past civilizations is some form of written communication where two necessary constants in the production of written records were required: a surface on which to write and a utensil or tool with which to do the writing that is called a pen.\n\nSo, carrying with this tradition and the demand of our human civilization, I have also used a pen to make my life easy before on many occasions just as I use it today at work. In fact, I use this pen quite frequently when I need to make any important notes or do some brainstorming and write the findings as a result of it in order to prepare an important report or document for my boss. Sometimes I even use it to write a preliminary report or document on some piece of paper before putting them on my computer. Then, of course, I don’t think that I would be able to highlight important stuff or points on a report or document without the use of a pen. Would I? \n\nTo conclude, I don’t think that I would be able to do my job properly without using a pen at one point or another. A pen has always offered me the speed and convenience of making many of my tasks more personal at my work. Finally, using a pen requires less thought and orientation from my part while also allowing me to form my opinions and speak my mind at the same time rather easily."

    "Answer": "I live in a crowded city, so naturally, there are different types of transportation systems in it to serve the needs of its residents. So, while people tend to use all of these transportations at one point or another, depending on their needs as well as the availability of those transports, one common transportation system, which commuters in my city use rather frequently, is public and private buses.\n\nYes, the sight of many public and private buses roaming on the streets and roads of my crowded city is very common, which starts from the very early morning and continue with providing commuting services until very late at night. Apparently, people from all walks of life and professions use this rather common and popular commuting system because of their hours of availability and comparatively low fares. In fact, one could get a bus in my city every 10 or 15 minutes, depending on their travel routes, probably because the demand for these bus services are not the same all over the city.  Anyway, so if we take the low fares and the high frequency of availability into consideration, one certainly would be tempted to consider this common transport system “convenient”. But, if they think about the issue of their overall travel comfort, they wouldn’t really consider it that convenient, simply because these buses are too crowded most of the times where many people have to stand on their feet for a long period of time. Besides, since these buses have to cover many designated bus stoppages in order to serve a maximum number of commuters, it usually takes a long period of time for the commuters to arrive at their destinations.\n\nAnyway, to be fair, I don’t really like this popular and common transportation system, primarily because it usually costs me a lot of time to arrive at my destination due to huge traffic problems. Besides, the seats in most of these buses are not very comfortable for riding unless you are using luxury buses for your trip. But, then again, I am not really willing to pay so much money to ride these luxury buses."

    "Answer": "Public Bus is a very common transportation system in our country and the majority of the commuters in cities and urban areas use this transportation system. There are two types of public bus systems in our country- short distance buses and long-distance buses. There are many governments owned bus service system which is available mostly in the metropolitan system. There are varieties of sizes in these buses ranging from 10 seats to as many as 100 seats and even double-decker buses as well.\n\nPeople from all classes and economic conditions use these buses and who do not own private cars, most of the times use this transportation system. Since there are cheap and expensive buses based on the facilities allowed, people with low earnings mostly use non-AC, small buses. While people with better economic conditions use air-conditioned and a bit expensive service.\n\nThis is the most convenient transportation system in our country in terms of expenses and availability. Hiring a taxi or private cars cost a lot and they are not always available. So people mostly depend on the public bus transportation system which offers a very low fare and are always available for almost all of the destinations.\n\nI mostly use this bus transportation system for short and long-distance travels and communications and I find it very handy. Though there are some disadvantages of this transportation system, I would say still this is the best way for commuters to move to different places in my city."

    "Answer": "Not sure about other people but I never like to miss an opportunity to eat any delicious dish whether I am eating them at home or at a restaurant. But, today, I would like to talk about one such delicious food item that I like to eat often at a restaurant.\n\nThis food item is called “Naan bread and Tandoori Chicken”. Even though this is a signature food item from the Indian subcontinent, it is certainly very popular in many other parts of the world. This Tandoori Chicken is a chicken dish prepared by roasting chicken marinated in yoghurt and spices in a tandoor which is a cylindrical clay oven.\n\nBy the way, this tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter/ appetizer, or it can also be eaten as a main dish, depending on what time of the day you are eating it. And, as for the Naan bread, it is a leavened, oven-baked flatbread, made from an enriched dough of all-purpose flour that include eggs and yoghurt in it, and which is also found in the cuisines of Western Asian, Myanmar and the Caribbean in addition to the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThis naan bread is usually served hot and brushed with ghee (clarified butter), and of course, it also has a crispy underside and chewy bread bubbles. Anyway, this food item is not just mouth-wateringly delicious but also rich in protein. So, no wonder that I just love this food item so much that I try to eat it as often as I can, but even if I don’t manage to eat it every day, I try to eat it at least 2/3 times a week. Yes, it’s that delicious!\n\nAnyway, I try to eat it outside of my home, primarily because it is not really that easy to prepare this food item at home. Besides, even if we prepare it at home, it just doesn’t taste as good as the ones that are found at the restaurant. Finally, I like to eat it outside of my home also because it allows me to change my taste after eating the same kind of foods on a regular basis."

    "Answer": "I often eat pizza in a fast food shop or in a food corner and I really like this food item.  Pizza is not made in our home and that’s why I eat it outside my home. Among the different shops and restaurants that offer pizza, I like Dominos Pizza most. They often bring variations on their pizzas and I find it convenient to go to a nearby Dominos Pizza shop and taste the pizza.\n\nI usually eat 3-4 pizzas in a month but of course, it varies. In some weeks I mostly stay home and do not hang around with friends. In such weeks I do not eat any pizza. But sometimes friends throw parties and I hang around with them often and at that time I eat about 2 pizzas in a week. So on average, the number is 3-4 in a month.\nThere are plenty of fast-food shops, restaurants and specialized pizza shops like Pizza Hut, Pizza Inn, Dominos Pizza, Yummy, Hot Pizza etc. that offer pizza. Since fast-food shops have grown hugely nowadays, I get it nearby my home, university and places I often go.\n\nI like the taste and variations of the pizza and they are convenient to find in a fast-food corner. Since it is not prepared at our home, I eat it outside. My friends also like this food item and while ordering a food item, most of us prefer pizza. The price is reasonable and it can be shared among friends. Because of my personal preference for pizza and the convenience of getting it, I often eat this food item outside the home."

    "Answer": "I live in England, and we are lucky in that we have many birds that visit our gardens as lots of people like to put out food to feed them, especially in the winter months. I’m going to tell you about one such common but distinctive bird. I will explain what it is, describe its appearance as best I can, let you know where you can see it and share with you some of its most common characteristics.\n\nThe bird I’m thinking of is the Robin, sometimes it’s referred to as robin redbreast, and it often features on wintry scenes on Christmas Cards.\n\nThese birds are very distinctive and enormously popular, in fact, earlier in 2015 it was voted Britain’s favourite native bird, and I’m not at all surprised. They are easy to identify, and very confident around people, so everyone knows a robin near to where they live. Size-wise I think they are about five to five and a half inches in length. They have a distinctly rounded appearance, when they fluff up their feathers for warmth in winter they can appear almost spherical, it makes you wonder how they can fly! The male and female are similar in colouration. Despite their name ‘redbreast’ in fact, they have an orange breast and face lined with grey, then brown upperparts and a whitish belly. It is the orange which is the most distinctive though, I don’t think a robin has ever been wrongly identified! I have been told the reason they are called ‘redbreast’ even though their colour is clearly orange, is because years ago there wasn’t a word for ‘orange’ in the English language, and red was the nearest approximation, I don’t know if that’s true, but it’s possible.\n\nYou can see robins in gardens everywhere. They are noisy and territorial so you will often only have one, or a pair in any patch of property. Although they are thought of as friendly because of how domesticated they appear with people, they can be pretty vicious with each other. It is not uncommon to see a robin furiously hurling itself at its own reflection in a window pane, attacking the glass with its wings and beak, thinking it is seeing off a rival. They are unconcerned by humans, not necessarily tame, but habituated to people they have learned that they can benefit from some human behaviours. For example, they will be attracted by the smell of newly turned earth, so if you are gardening, or sweeping leaves it is a very common experience for a robin to come and join you. They will come really close, standing on the handle of a garden fork to watch for worms or insects which they will then fly down and eat. It is very satisfying if you are digging to turn up a worm and see a hungry robin seize it – less satisfying for the worm I suppose!\n\nIf you are living in the UK or even parts of Europe, I’m sure you’ll know this bird already, but even if you don’t I’d be surprised if you hadn’t seen one on a Christmas card or in a Christmas film at some point – they get everywhere."

    "Answer": "Some people in India like to call them “birds in the backyards” while some others like to consider them as the symbols of “undying love” because they often pair for life. But, to me and many other common people like me in India, they are more popularly known as “Myna” bird.\n\nAlthough this little bird, which is about 23 to 26 cm long and weighs about 82 to 143 gram, native to India, they are also found in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Myanmar in large numbers. Being the birds of the starling family (Sturnidae), even though, this is a group of passerine birds, which occur naturally only in southern and eastern Asia, they can also be found in North America, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Having a wingspan of 120 to 142 mm, these are popular birds as crop pest control agents. \n\nCommon mynas live in a range of climates and habitats and are extremely adaptable. They prefer warm to hot climates and are more abundant in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate areas. Open areas where there is little tree cover, such as suburban open parks and gardens, are their prime habitats. The common myna also inhabits in cleared agricultural areas, especially open grasslands, cultivated paddocks, and plantations. The Common Myna can be closely associated with human habitation as well, including roof voids and bridges.\n\nAs far as the common characteristics of these “myna” birds are concerned, they are usually small and stocky birds. Mynah birds have blackheads and brown bodies and wings, with bright yellow-orange bills, feet and skin around the eyes. The underside of the wings has white patches, which are generally visible only during the flight. Both males and females aggressively defend their nests, although the female is the primary nester once the eggs are laid. Both parents will feed the chicks until they leave the nest, usually within a month of hatching. Finally, Mynah birds are the best mimics on the planet, rivalling parrots in their speaking ability."

    "Answer": "The kingfisher is a common bird in our country and it is really a beautiful bird. This bird probably got its name from its habit of catching fishes from the ponds and lakes.\n\nIn a single word, this, in my opinion, is the most beautiful bird I have ever seen. This bird has got red, blue, greyish, yellow and many other colour combinations on its father and the tail is usually longer than other birds. The keen eyes, the speedy movement and its ability to catch fishes in the blink of eyes make it a very distinguishable bird. In our country, the bird is very common in urban and village area where lots of ponds, lakes and rivers are available. Since it catches fishes, it can be seen near the water mostly.\n\nThis bird is a fine hunter. The way it flies and catches fishes is simply amazing. I have never seen any other birds that can catch fishes or other insects so fast. The gorgeous colour combination, the thin and long tail makes this bird exceptional from other birds. This bird can be seen mostly in the morning and in the evening as fishes come to the upper side of the water at that time. I really like this bird and definitely, it is a bird of beauty and skill."

    "Answer": "I spent my childhood in an urban area that was full of natural graces and wonders. The vast green fields, rivers, hill, the blue sky and the playmates of my childhoods were my best part of my lively and magical childhood. I used to play lots of games in my childhood and among them, Blind man's buff was one of my most favourite.\n\nThis game required minimum of 4-5 kids to play. Initially, one kid would be selected to be blindfolded and his/her eyes would be tied up so that s/he can't see anything. A big circle would be drawn and no one is allowed to go out of this circle. The blindfolded kid would try to catch someone while others would try to protect themselves but would not be able to go outside the circle. If the blindfolded kid can touch someone and can say his/her name, the blindfolded kid would get free and the other one who was touched would be blindfolded this time. This was the basic rules of the game and we used to play this game according to this rule.\n\nI mostly played this game with my cousins, neighbouring kids and classmates. I was then around 4-5 years old and the other kids whom I used to play with were around the same age.\n\nAs I recall, I played this game when I was a kid if 4-5 years old. Probably I have not played this game after I was promoted to grade three. This was a game played by kids and in our country, this is played by the kids only. It is not at all a game for the grown-ups and I have never seen any adult person playing this game. So, I do not play this game anymore. Among the games, I play still now, includes cricket, football, badminton, table tennis but not the blind man's buff at all. This was a game for kids and I enjoyed this game as a kid."

    "Answer": "It is quite fun to think back to the games I used to play when I was little. I’m going to tell you about a particular game I used to play, how it was played and who with, and try and come up with an explanation as to why I don’t do it anymore when it was so much fun at the time!\n\nI think the time when I played most games with friends was when I was at junior school; that would be up to the age of about ten or eleven. At morning and lunchtime breaks we were all turfed out of the school building to play outside whatever the weather, and that meant we played a lot of large group games. Some games are probably played in various ways the world over, chasing games like ‘tag’ for example, or a rather boisterous game we called British Bulldog which was eventually banned in our school for being too dangerous! That involved somebody being ‘it’ and everyone else rushing from one side of the playground to the other, ‘it’ meant being the catcher, and they had to somehow bring down as many people as they could, in whatever way they fancied, to stop them making it across the space. Anyone they floored in this way also became catchers, until everyone was ganging up against the few individuals left! There were a lot of bloody noses… Happy Days!  However, I digress, the game I want to tell you about is a bit different. It is called ‘conkers’ and we could only play it at a particular time of year.\n\nIn autumn, in England, horse chestnut trees produce seeds which are beautiful shiny spheres of deep chocolate colour, encased in a spikey green fleshy shell. The game consists of first gathering up suitable conkers from the ground where they have fallen off the trees. You have to select a robust-looking conker and then drill a hole in it using whatever sharp implement you have to hand that your parents don’t know about it! You then thread your conker onto a string or shoelace, with a large knot at the end to stop it falling off the thread. Next, you find an opponent, who has a similarly carefully selected conker on a string. One player holds their conker in front of them dangling on a thread, and the other tries to strike it with their own conker. Players take it in turns until one conker breaks, and the other is declared victorious. The winning conker becomes a ‘one-er’ after beating one conker, a ‘two-er’ after destroying two and so on. It also takes on the score of any other conkers it successfully breaks. Some games were friendly with your mates, others were much more challenging, when you had a really high scoring conker, other players would want to take you on to try and smash your now much-prized horse chestnut seed!\n\nThe game could get very competitive, and if I’m honest, a bit dangerous too, with small children furiously smashing each other’s conkers perilously close to each other’s faces and shards of shattered conker flying off in all directions! Some people would take the ‘game’ very seriously; tricks were employed to harden conkers. For example, you could ‘cheat’ by slowly baking a conker in an oven or soaking it in vinegar. Even so, there was real prestige attached to having a conker that survived many games, so the stakes were high!\n\nI stopped playing conkers after I left junior school. This was probably partly because there weren’t horse chestnut trees to pass on the way to school anymore, this meant there were no more carpets of fallen conkers to choose from en route to the playground. However, it was also because at senior school it would have been seen as ‘babyish’ to play such games anymore, senior school students were far too cool and sophisticated to shriek with laughter as they smashed each other’s conkers on strings during break times! Writing this though has made me think that maybe this autumn I will find myself a conker and a willing friend, and see if we can have as much fun playing together as we used to as children. I suspect we will… though I fear we may also find we are even more furiously competitive than we were in childhood, still who says growing old means you have to grow up?!"

    "Answer": "As a child, I wasn’t exactly a very physically fit person, and therefore, participating in any kind of sports – physically demanding sports - was among the least of my concerns or wishes. But, when it came to playing badminton, I somehow found it a bit easier to play than other “physically demanding” sports. \n\nBut, please don’t get tempted to assume here that I was overly enthusiastic about playing badminton or I was really enjoying. Rather, I used to play this game once in a while (especially, during the wintertime) because one of my neighbourhood uncles used to offer me some delicious chocolate candies – chocolate candies that I really used to love as a child – as a “bribe” to play that sport with him, apparently because he couldn’t find any suitable partner to play badminton with him.\n\nOf course, there was another “secret” reason (which I had never told to anybody up and until today) for me for playing that sport, and it was, as some of my “smart” school friends had told me, that playing badminton would make me taller. Now, for an average child with a rather “limited physical” ability, it was more than enough of a reason to play badminton as a child. But, still, I think that I, as a child with a weak physique, could take all the feelings of pride in hitting the shuttlecock with the racquet to the other half of the court, over the net, and scoring points. So, did I ever score 21 points to win a “game” against an adult? The answer is “no”, but I sure am glad that I was very close.\n\nAnyway, I don’t play badminton anymore, primarily because I have become busier with my works and other things. Besides, as I have grown older, my taste and preferences in playing sports, like many other things in life, have changed. In other words, I enjoy playing other sports more than badminton like billiard and chess."

    "Answer": "I always try my best to admire any kind of human quality that benefits our society and bring us human closer together. But, out of all of those good human qualities, I admire “modesty” the most, and today, I would like to talk about it here.\n\nSo what exactly is “modesty”? Well, while different people would try to render different meaning to it, I would say that modesty is a feeling or attitude that encourages to think that we have no special importance over the others. In other words, it is a sense of “lack of pride” which prevents us from feeling that we are somehow better than others. \n\nBut, unfortunately, no matter how much we admire this great human quality, the truth is that modesty is an underrated quality that isn’t touched upon often by the majority among us. Some of us are even tempted to overlook this great human attribute by telling to ourselves that it is something that is only mentioned heavily in religious texts, and it may seem a little old-fashioned, and as such, we don’t really need it that much in this day and age, but, as far as I am concerned, I try to give “modesty” the utmost importance. Of course, it is difficult to acquire true modesty because it essentially demands from us to belittle ourselves in front of the whole world. Besides, most of us think that being humble is a sign of weakness, so we try to avoid it at all costs because we just hate to appear “weak” in front of others.  \n\nAnyway, I admire “modesty” so much, mainly because it allows us room for self-improvement, both in our personal and professional life. Besides, we also need humility or modesty for our inner-peace because it helps us navigate the losses in our life better and pick ourselves up after the falls. Finally, I admire it because it brings us closer to each other by eliminating our artificial differences, in a society that is full of hatred and animosity."

    "Answer": "Honesty is the quality I admire most and I believe that honesty is the mantra towards a corruption-free happy world. To me, honesty is a quality that involves being honest in every way of life.\n\nHonesty is considered to be the most important virtue as this quality ensures a balance and authentically structured society where each member would work together towards a better world.\n\nThe virtues and good qualities are deeply rooted with honesty. Only an honest person can be truthful, brave and benevolent. A dishonest person will start acquiring other vile characteristics and with time, s/he would become a corrupted and harmful person in every sphere of life. Honesty makes a man brave and happy. A dishonest person can't be truly happy and contended.\n\nThis is indeed a difficult quality to acquire if that was not rooted from the early childhood of a person. The society and circumstances offer many attractions and denying all of those devilish attractions and greed is something an honest person would do. To me, this is the first and foremost important quality a good person must have."

Therefore, talking about a classroom here is indeed going to be a challenge for me, but still, I would like to go ahead and talk about a classroom which, I thought, was a bit different than the others.\n\nAnyway, this classroom, I want to talk about, belonged to a junior high school that I attended about 215 years ago. But, it wasn’t exactly like a regular classroom since we had to study in it as an alternative room. In fact, at that time, our school was going through some kind of renovation works, and as a result, we needed to move to another place (room) to help facilitate the renovation works. \n\nThis particular classroom was isolated in one corner of the school building which was more like a small size warehouse than a classroom. In other words, it was considerably bigger than a regular classroom. Of course, everything, including a few dozens of small tables, a large desk (to be used by the teachers), a comfortable chair (again, for the teacher) and some benches were set in that room. There were a few electrical ceiling fans as well inside it, along with a large whiteboard hanging from the wall. And, as far as its look was concerned, it looked a bit rusty with some cracks on its wall, and the painting on it was worn and torn down in most places. By the way, the room also had at least 4 large windows with two entrances. \n\nNow, I am not sure about the other students, but I surely liked studying in it, mainly because it was big enough to manoeuvre ourselves at ease without bumping onto each other. I liked it also because there were empty spaces all around it, and as such, plenty of natural air and light could enter it to make me feel energized and motivated."

When I was promoted to grade 3, we were transferred to a large class and that’s in my experience is the best classroom I have ever had even though I had classes in many ultramodern rooms later on. This classroom was on the North side of the school and there were 3-4 windows and 2 large doors in this class. We could see the flowing rivers and a part of hills from this classroom.\n\nThis room has an ‘L’ shape and could accommodate more than 50 students. It looked similar to a large hall room except that it gave the impression of an urban house. The furniture of this room was locally built and was all wooden.  There was a large blackboard where the teachers used to write with the white chalks.\n\nMost of the students liked this room because of the fresh air it could provide to the students. The temperature during the summer was usually high and this room was amazingly soothing. The ceiling was unusually high (around 20 feet from the floor), unlike the rooms we see nowadays. We all loved to have classes in this room and the teachers were very careful to us about studies and that’s why even being a remote location and underfunded school, it could maintain a steady result each year."

So, the other day, when I was listening to one of the most popular radio stations from the USA, I came across a programme that I really enjoyed.\n\nThis radio programme, I am talking about, was about how to live a long and healthy life. Hosted by a very knowledgeable medical doctor (at least, that’s what I thought when I heard him talking), the radio programme went to a great length in describing, among many other things, how we have become so much health-conscious and yet we never care to do the most basic and simple things that can actually help us live a very healthy and happy life for a rather long, long period of time. \n\nIn support of his arguments, the good doctor brought forward the examples from the people of the so-called “blue zones” (“blue zones” are the places in the world where people usually have the healthiest and longest lives) like Okinawa  in Japan, Ikaria in Greece, Sardinia in Italy, Nicoya in Costa Rica, and Loma Linda in California (USA). By the way, the programme was presented at a rather slow speed so that the listeners could actually understand each and every important health-related information, presented in it. To make the programme even more engaging and interesting, the doctor aired some interviews with the old couples from the “blue zones”, talking about some of their funny old memories, in between his presentation segments so that the followers of the programme could enjoy some light moments.\n\nAnyway, I found the programme to be rather interesting, mainly because it helped me get rid of some of the common misconceptions that were related to living a healthy life in general. Besides, it also allowed me to learn about the lifestyles of some of the most exotic places in the world. All in all, it was a great and informative programme."

In fact, as far back as I can remember, my family, especially my mother and sister, don’t like to hold onto a dining table for more than a couple of years at maximum, apparently because it either gets “old” ( or worn out) or it becomes old fashioned, according to them, of course. \n\nBut, interestingly enough, when my family bought the dining table, I am talking about here, before more than 3 years, it looked like my mother and younger sister finally had found their “ultimate” dining table that they were searching for so long. In other words, they wanted to hold onto this beautiful piece of furniture for as long as they could.\n\nSo, why they adore this dining table so much? Well, to begin with, it is a piece of French-polished furniture that is made from a very strong and solid-looking walnut wood. Its unique and gorgeous brown colour would surely attract anybody’s attention and impress them. On top of that, the table is very nicely curved around its edges to offer it even a classier look. But, above all, it serves its purpose perfectly well by allowing all of my family members to sit and enjoy a meal together. \n\nAnyway, we have this beautiful piece of furniture at my home, apparently, because we can use it as a perfect gathering “spot” for our whole family while enjoying quality time together over a meal.  We have it also because it adds immensely to the decoration feature and design of our home."

    "Answer": "In my humble opinion, I think that every profession can be challenging, depending on, of course, how serious a person really is about his professional roles and responsibilities, but being a professional medical doctor is probably way more challenging than other professions, I presume.\n\nBut, no matter how much challenging this profession seems to be, I don’t think that there are any shortages of people in this world who don’t want to be a medical doctor, most certainly because of the financial benefits, service and prestige that the profession carries with it.\n\nAnyway, so what are exactly the responsibilities of a medical doctor that make it so financially promising and prestigious? Well, to answer this question very simply, it is to save the lives of the people – all kinds of people that are – by carefully diagnosing their diseases, conditions and symptoms. Medical Doctors perform health assessments, run diagnostic tests, prescribe medication, create treatment plans and provide health and wellness advice to their patients. Some doctors may also perform physical surgeries on their patients, depending on their physical conditions, in order to help them heal better and quicker.\n\nBy the way, it is not really easy to qualify and get a practising license as a medical doctor since one must first finish a 4-5 year undergraduate degree program, followed by completing 2-7 years of residency training (or “internship”) at a medical school or college, depending on the countries where the degrees are offered. Besides, one would also need to complete a post-graduation degree in order to become a “specialist” doctor (such as a specialist in medicine or specialist in heart disease).\n\nAnyway, being a medical doctor is really challenging, primarily because he or she always has to remain utmost careful in treating patients because one simple mistake can cost lives. Besides, for most medical doctors, they have very little or no social life outside of their profession because they have to remain on guard 24/7 for emergencies, life-saving calls, regardless of their own needs and priorities."

    "Answer": "In my opinion being a Police officer is a challenging job. In fact, I can clearly understand this from my acquaintances with a friend of my brother whose name is Jacob and who works a police officer in our city.\n\nTo work in the police force, someone must be a by-born citizen of this country and has to finish at least 12 grades. Then comes the physical fitness and to be allowed to be a police officer, someone must have minimum 5 feet 7-inch height and a good physical structure and work stamina. The background of any individual has to be neat and clean to be the part of the police department as the authority always does a background check of the applicant. There is a very rigid training that every selected individual has to pass to be finally appointed in the workforce.\n\nThe responsibilities are huge and honest. Every police officer takes the oath to serve the country and people. Their primary responsibility is to establish the law in the society and track the people who do not abide by the laws. They take challenges to find a criminal, they try to keep the peace in the society, they work as the protector of the good people and they hunt down the bad guys.\n\nBeing honest and maintaining the vows a police officer takes at the beginning of his/her recruitment is a pretty challenging task. There are plenty of opportunities to be corrupted and earning illegal money and a good police officer has to refrain him/ her from this. The criminals in a society often are the powerful people and a police officer has to take risks to control those criminals. The officer must be ready to work any time needed and often stays away from home and family for a long. In most of the countries, the police officers are not high paying employees of the country but the challenges they take (both psychologically and physically) are greater than most of the other professionals. From my conversation with Jacob (the friend of my brother), I learned many daring and puzzling challenges he has faced. He has even taken challenges that could have easily killed him and yet he is not always honoured by people. This is a professional where new challenges and dangers always wait in the road."

    "Answer": "A couple of years ago, on the eve of the new year, I visited one of my cousin’s office at the centre of a major city of my country, and today I would like to talk about that office here. By the way, it was a personal visit (because I hadn’t seen him in a long time), and I just wanted to say hello to him.\n\nThe office, I am talking about, is the corporate office of a large furniture making company in my country. The office is located in a 3-storey tall building, but it was built on a rather large site which was surrounded by a boundary. Built with all kinds of modern materials, the office building looked rather new to me with its nice painting and the little beautiful flower plants that were beautifully set on its balconies all around in the flower tubs.\n\nAs I have already mentioned earlier, it was a large corporate office site where at least 200 professionals, both young and middle-aged, could be seen there working. By the way, even though, both young and middle-aged people were working there, I would say that the middle-age people were in the majority, which meant to me that the office valued experienced people a bit more than the young ones.\n\nAnyway, all the 3 floors of the office were used as offices, but at one corner of the ground floor, I could see a large cafeteria, serving lunch to the employees, and a TV room right beside it. At the solitary entrance, I could also see a reception with security personnel who were controlling the movements of the traffics to the large office building.\n\nWell, like any other corporate office, this office was also seen to be busy in taking care of finance and accounting, shipment activities, as well as procurement of all kinds of materials necessary to build their furniture. The office is also responsible for addressing all kinds of complaints from its customers through its customer service and quality control departments."

    "Answer": "A few months back I went to a call centre office named ‘Tech 5’ where my friend Ronald used to work. It was a huge office with more than 300 employees and was on the entire 3rd floor of the Lotus building. This company is the largest call centre in our city and has employed many students and professionals.\n\nThere were two types of employees three: full time and part-time and students mostly worked there as part-time employees. Students with good communication skill in English were eligible to be interviewed there. After getting employed, the students could choose their preferred shift for work. The full-time employees were mostly in managerial, administrative and IT networking jobs while the call centre agents mostly were mostly students and fresh graduates. There were some middle-aged call centre agents who took this field as their long term profession and worked there from 9 to 5.\n\nI went to meet my friend Ronald who was in office at that time. He asked me to lend him some storybooks and was supposed to meet me near my home. But in the evening he called me to meet him in his office so that I could give him the books as well as talk to his manager regarding a part-time job I was looking for.\n\nThis company mainly relied on outsourcing and call centre jobs. The agents in this office were mostly young people who either called the end-users for selling products or services or received calls to give certain information to customers or to record their complaints about a particular product or service. The office used to work for large multinational companies to provide the customer care service or to promote their products or services. In return, they would earn the commissions or a contracted amount. They also had a software development and web designing team who used to work for direct clients."

    "Answer": "I just love travelling by trains, as opposed to travelling by bus, and luckily there is a nice and large train station in the city where I live. So, I guess that I will go ahead and talk about that train station here as per the instructions of this interesting cue card topic.\n\nThis nice and large train station is located at the centre of my home town that has a very huge empty space on its both sides in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffics and passengers from both directions. Next to those huge empty spaces and adjacent to the actual rail station, where passengers board their trains, a few nice and large, 2-storey buildings are standing where a large number of officials can be seen doing different kinds of station related jobs and activities.\n\nAt the ground floors of those buildings, mostly ticket selling agents and staffs can be seen busy in selling train tickets to their customers and serving their other needs. Next to one of those large office buildings, there is a huge storage place which is used to keep different kinds of consumer products to carry them in the trains. Both passenger carrying trains and consumer products carrying trains come to this station to serve all kinds of transportation needs of its customers from one part of the country to another part.  \n\nAnyway, since this train station is conveniently located in the centre of the city, it is connected through all kinds of roads and streets, and as such, people can easily come to this station by using all kinds of vehicles, big or small.  \n\nWell, people use this train station to catch their trains in order to travel to different parts of my country rather easily and affordably. Some people use this train station also because it is really easy and convenient to transport their belongings from one place to another by using its train services. Finally, some people come to this train station to see off or welcome their friends and family."

    "Answer": "I live at (…say the area name…) in the (…city name…) and this is 15 minutes driving distance from the bus terminal. This is one of the busiest bus stations in our city. The area where I live in has a large number of populations who use this station to go to different places every day. This bus station is beside the old bridge area and adjacent to the gas station and cantonment school.\n\nUsually, public buses, double-deck buses, taxies and rent-a-cars are available on this station. People can hire large private cars in case they want to hire it for the entire day for a long-distance journey. Each day almost 5 thousand people go to different places from this station.\n\nI can reach the station in 15 minutes if I drive my car or around 20 minutes if I take a taxi. It would take around an hour to reach there if I want on foot. Alternatively, I can take a tram bus to reach there and it takes around 25 minutes. Usually, I go to my workplace/ university from this bus station and to reach this bus station I rely on the public bus that I can catch just in front of my home.\n\nThis is the largest bus station in our area and buses travel almost in every direction from here. People around this area come to this station first to take a car to go to long distances. Even the inter-bus city service is available only in this station and people have to get at this station first to go outside our city. The train station is far away from our city and that’s why people in our area mostly rely on this bus station to go to different parts of the city or even outside the city."

    "Answer": "When growing up as a young boy, I have gone to different playgrounds. But, one particular playground always comes to my mind more than others, and today I would like to talk about that playground here.\n\nThis special playground was located behind the high school which I attended about more than 12 years from now. Luckily, this high school, that I attended, was located in the same city where I used to live back then, so I didn’t only play in that ground during the school hours, but also before and after the school hours. So, it is fair to suggest that I know each and every foot of that playground where I enjoyed playing all kinds of sports so much, not only with my fellow high school students but also with my other friends from the town.\n\nBy the way, it wasn’t exactly a large playground, so when different groups of boys would play different types of sports side by side, it used to look fairly crowded. But, still, we all managed to share the ground among each other and enjoy our sports. By the way, not only the young students from our high school used to play in that playground but also other young boys who didn’t attend our high school also went there to plat.  \n\nI don’t really visit this playground anymore except on a rare occasion nor do I play there anymore, but whenever I visit this beautiful playground, I can still the beautiful green grass all over it, inviting me to touch them and roll on them like I used to do when I was a young boy. Besides, the little pond is still there, with its clear water, tempting me to cleanse myself in it just like I used to do during my good olden days.\n\nSo, anyway, based on these happy memories of mine of this playground, it is fair to conclude that I still very much like this ground like an evergreen friend who never gets old."

    "Answer": "I grew up in a suburban area and there were plenty of parks, fields and playgrounds. But among those places, the school playground where I used to play often is one of my most favourite. This was a large open field in front of our school and I played there more than 4 years from my grade 3 till grade 7. We were not allowed to play in this playground when we were supposed to attend the classes. Apart from that, we were allowed to play there whenever we wished.\n\nI was around 7 years old when I got admitted to the City International School and I was happy to have many good friends there. We used to play there during the break period and even sometimes after school. I still remember 3-4 friends of mine, from grade 4, and they were my regular playmates in this playground. The childhood was magical and we enjoyed playing everything we knew we could play. We even enjoyed the aimless running and hide-and-seek games we played there. There were some special toys and playing tools arranged by the school when we were promoted to class 5 but those were mostly for kids from grade 1 and 2. So we did not use these toys and tools while paying as we knew that those are only for small kids. The friends I played with were my classmates as well and we were very intimate at that time.\n\nI liked playing in this playground very much. Actuality I liked it so much that I still remember this playground. I have played in many other playgrounds but while thinking about them, I found I miss this particular playground from my early school more than many other places where I played. That’s why I picked it to talk about. I guess I will never forget my days of childhood and my memory regarding this playground where I often played with my classmates and friends."

    "Answer": "I, as a young boy, remember requesting my father to take me to an amusement park for a long time, but unfortunately, my wish wasn’t granted simply because there wasn’t an amusement park in my hometown. Of course, there was an amusement park in a different city, far away from my hometown, but my father was too busy to take me there. So, I actually had to wait a long time to materialize my dream of visiting an amusement park, only when my school had organized a tour to one in that big city.\n\nAnyway, it all happened about 14 years ago when I had just started high school. But, I must say that, as I remember it now, the sheer excitement of visiting an amusement park was actually more than actually going into that amusement park and see it with my own eyes. And I am assuming that the same happened with the other kids also, as far as the excitement was concerned.\n\nBy the way, our high school had organized that tour for the first time in the history of our school because the authority really wanted us to get a firsthand experience of visiting an amusement park as a child. Now, to talk about the amusement park in a bit more details, it occupied around 10 acres of land, and it had all kinds of games and rides, including rollercoasters, railways, water rides, and ferries wheel, among many other things, as far as I can remember. However, the best things about that amusement park, I visited, it had attractions that were catered to different age groups.  \n\nAnyway, I mostly enjoyed all the rides while playing a couple of games, including “balloon and darts”.  I even own a little toy car in that game! I also watched a kid’s movie there with my friends. Finally, I also had a lot of fun at the food corners there who served us with a lot of nice snacks and foods."

    "Answer": "For a long time, I have not been to a park or amusement park but my visit to a renowned amusement park in our city last year was so pleasant that I look forward to revisit there. The amusement park I am talking about is nearly 40 kilometres away from the city where I live in and is a large one. It is beside the City resort and occupies around 12 acres area.\n\nI went there with my parents, 4-5 cousins and 2 nephews. This was a family trip and we planned to take the children to a place where they would be able to enjoy. Since the busy school schedules often bore the children, we planned to take them somewhere and let them enjoy their time. As part of the plan we left home early in the morning and spent almost the entire day there.\n\nSince there were many teenagers and children with us, we had to look after them. I managed the tickets, purchased lunch and took care of the children. I enjoyed 2-3 rides and mostly took photos of me parents with the kids.\n\nIn the noon I planned to have a bath in the swimming pool and I really enjoyed that. We also enjoyed a 3D movie in the park and after I won a doll in the balloon game, I shouted like a 10 years old child. That was a refreshing gathering for us and I enjoyed both the company of my family members and the nice environments and amusement facility of this park."

    "Answer": "Being a citizen from the United Kingdom, I have many reasons to be proud of my country. One of the reasons is that it has produced many world-famous scientists, and today I would like to talk about one of them here.\n\nAnyway, I have no doubt in my mind that the person, I am going to talk about here, is known to virtually every person in this world who has studied little science, and his name is Sir Isaac Newton. Yes, Isaac Newton is one of those rare breeds of physicists and scientists whose scientific invention has changed the world forever, and of course, for better.  \n\nAs for his scientific invention, he is most for his works with “forces”, and specifically with the development of a universal law of gravity, but the true genius of his work, experts think, is how he ultimately took his theories and applied them to the universe at large, explaining the motions of the Sun and planets in a way that had never been done before. He also provided a clear understanding of “optics”. Being an inventor of “calculus”, his three laws motion, written in “Principia Mathematica”, greatly influenced the enlightenment in Europe and then eventually the rest of the world as well.\n\nBy the way, I first to came to know about this great scientist as a child from one of my uncles (a physics teacher) who told me about that famous story of a falling apple on the head of a person and then how that person came up with a theory from that falling apple. Later on, of course, I came to know even more from studying at school and college.\n\nAnyway, Newton is still one of the most famous people in the history of the world because of his tremendous contribution to move forward our human civilization. Besides, the fact that people remember him today with tremendous respect and admiration is because his inventions and theories provided for the basis of modern-day physics."

His invention and tools greatly influenced the human around the world. He is considered as one the greatest scientists and inventors of all time and almost everybody around the world knows his name and contributions to the world. His most popular inventions include the electric bulb, motion picture camera, phonograph, carbon microphone, fluoroscopy and the improvement of telegraph technology. He was a devoted scientist, creative mind and a prolific inventor who had more than 1000 US patents in his name.\n\nI first learned about him when I was only 5 years old. My grandpa one day told me about the light bulb and said the story about this great inventor. Later I learn about him from a book I read about his life. In my university years, I read several other books on different scientists and inventions and Thomas Alva Edison was in all of these books.\nHis childhood and passion for new invention were so interesting that I hear many stories of this genius from my friends. As I recall, I watched a TV documentary show on the Discovery Channel that emphasised the great contribution of this scientist.\n\nHe is, without any question, a man who contributed to the progress of human civilisation. Many of his inventions were pure genius and unparallel. Many of his inventions and researches are still the motivation for scientists and science students. In many countries, he is still a part of the national syllabus in textbooks. People revere this highly talented person and will remember his as a symbol of a mastermind."

But, I have always taken a bit of extra interest in environmental issues, so when one of my friends asked me one day, about a couple of years ago from now, to participate in a rally to “save the environment” of our country, I just couldn’t refuse.\n\nThe rally was supposed to be started from the city centre, the city where I live, and would walk about 5/6 kilometres in order to raise awareness among the citizens of our city (and eventually the whole country) about the impending environmental disaster that our country was facing.\n\nDuring the rally, we were also supposed to hand over little leaflets to the passing by residents on the roads and the streets. Anyway, the rally started in due time, at about 8 am, and we did everything in our rally as was planned. We even stopped at a few major points of the city and delivered some speeches with facts and information about the environmental degradation of cities and country. Of course, it was a long and exhausting walk, but the great thing was that people actually showed their interest in the very issue, we were trying to highlight in the rally, and some of them even joined us.\n\nBy the way, my friend was some kind of political leader who was in charge of encouraging people from his area to participate into the rally, and it was him who gave me a t-shirt and a cap with the “save the environment, save the earth” logo on them. So, in the end, I did thank him for the t-shirt and cap, as well as the opportunity to take part in the rally.\n\nAnyway, I participated in the rally because I truly believed in environmental arguments that the rally was trying to promote. I participated in it also because it allowed me to meet a number of prominent academics, scientists and artists from my country who I had always admired."

It was probably the month of December and I was present in this seminar. In fact, one of my friends was an active member of the city welfare committee and he insisted me to join this seminar. This was mainly focused on requesting people to use water in a sensible way. The city authority was having a great problem regarding the unexpected increase of water demand and they found that more than 20% water can be saved if people use little senses and become aware of the great problems of the scarcity of water supply.\n\nIt was in the evening and was conducted in a large open field. There were around 400 people present in this seminar. The seminar started with the speech from the city counsellor and then other guests gave their speeches. Many interesting information and facts were presented on this seminar and it was so touchy that I promised myself that I would be very careful not to waste a single drop of water from now on.\n\nI was mostly the listener of the great speeches given by the participants. I was sitting in the front row and watched the slides presented in the seminar. Then a rally was conducted in our neighbourhood and I walked with the people and hold a placard that said ‘Save water, save the future’.\n\nI actually went there because of my friend’s request. But later on, I realised that it was a good seminar to attend and from this seminar I actually got the inspiration to attend such seminars and rallies.

But, there is always a “first time’ for everything, just like my “first time” with a video game. Today, I would like to talk about that video game here that I played about 6 years ago as a university student.\n\nThe name of this video game was “FIFA International Soccer Sega Genesis”, and I played it with one of my friends from high school. I knew that my high school friend was crazy about playing video games, and I also knew that I didn’t stand a chance to win against him, but still I chose to play against him because I was really bored to death. Anyway, we started the video game where I was playing as “Brazil” (yes, Brazil has always been my favourite team) while my friend was playing as Germany.\n\nIn the first half of the game, I made a lot of fouls that two of my team members got a yellow card. Not only that but also, the entire first half, my team couldn’t take even one shot to the goalkeeper of my opponent team. In fact, my team Brazil played so badly and miserably that we were lucky to have conceded only 5 goals!  Luckily, however, after the interval, I understood the tricks of playing against my opponent to some extent, but still, I didn’t dare to think that was actually able to score against such a strong opponent. But, then I guess that luck favoured me as I got just one corner kick in my favour, and I was able to score a goal while my friend scores another three goals. So, it was indeed a win for my friend against my team but I was excited about the only goal that I scored!\n\nAnyway, I think that I really enjoyed playing the game, mainly because it was an impressive game and my friend was a great player. Besides, it was one of the rare moments when I played any video games with another person."

This was a strategy game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft Studios.  There were three series of this game and I played the second series called Age of Empire the Conqueror. This was a historic strategy game that the gamers could have played either in single-player or in multiplayer mode.\n\nI mostly played it when I was 16-18 years old. I usually played it against computer competitors and sometimes against my friends over the computer network.\nThere were several civilizations that a player had to pick from and then develop this civilization in every aspect to protect it from the attack of other civilizations. Each civilization had its own strength and weakness and the player had to control the game for a long time. The different soldiers, defence mechanism, war strategy, war defence and research and different technologies made it a really interesting game.\n\nI often played it against the computer when I picked a civilization and the computer had other 3 civilizations. We fought each other and often I won the games against the computer in Hard game mode. I often played with my friends and that was a different experience as I had to compete against a real human. That was more competitive and I enjoyed thoroughly playing against my friends."

This cue card topic reminds me of the computer games 'Need for Speed' that I used to play.\n\nNeed for Speed was a racing game that was published by Electronic Arts. The first version was released in 1994 and I have played several other releases of this game in later years. I have played this game for about four years. This computer game is considered as the most successful racing game series ever. Over 50 million copies of this game series have been sold worldwide.\n\nI mostly played it alone on my computer. The control of the game was mostly on the keyboard. Sometimes I played it with my friends and younger brother Max. The multiplayer option in a later release of this game allowed me to play online which was quite exciting.\n\nThis was probably the most popular computer game of our time. It was exciting, challenging and suitable for all ages. Most of my friends liked this game. The graphics of this game were excellent compared to other video games available at that time and it required a minimum configuration in a computer to be installed and played. Since I was interested in the car driving in my real life and a fan of racing competition, I loved to act like a renowned racing star in a computer game. This was probably a computer game that has been played by almost every teenager in our time. The challenging races, intriguing racing tracks, different levels, vivid graphics and absorbing quality of the game made it quite popular and I was a big fan of this game. I remember saving money to buy the CD of this game. My younger brother also loved this game and often challenged me to play with him.

    "Answer": "I have a number of favourite singers who always force me to evaluate and re-evaluate their musical works because of their unique, and sometimes, extraordinary musical appeal, but one particular singer, who has always puzzled me with his musical talent, is John Lennon for many years.  \n\nJohn Lennon, arguably one of the best singers of all time who changed the trajectory of “rock and roll” music forever, is not only a singer but also a “reformist”. Lennon was “rebellious” in nature, and almost all of his songs reflected that particular aspect of his characteristics. He didn’t like war, political corruption along with many other contemporary social “ills”, and his songs also just followed suit. Even though this great singer was a “social reformer”, he didn’t forget to express love, friendship, intellectual keenness and sense of humour in his songs in a rather unique manner. Anyway, all kinds of people, including young or old, professionals or working-class people, regular persons or intellectuals, male or female with a bit “rebel” in them, love to listen to his music. Having said that, however, only “philanthropists” people actually appreciate his musical talents as the way they should be.\n\nJohn Lennon is my favourite singer mainly because makes me care for the people and society around me. He is my favourite singer also because no other singer like Lennon has ever been able to mix “acerbic” with intellectual humour before. Besides, I feel like each and every song of John Lennon carries some kind of “secret” meanings. On top of that, unlike many other singers, John Lennon used to write and compose many of his songs by himself, and as a result, many of his songs have become real “masterpiece”. Finally, John Lennon is my favourite singer also because of his different vocal techniques from song to song."

He is the leader of rock songs of his time. The lyrics and music are extraordinary and whenever I listen to his songs, it gives me sensational feelings. Many of his songs have become parts of my life and memory. He is such a singer who can amuse me with most of his songs. Because of the rich lyrics and pleasant voice, he has become my most favourite singer."

    "Answer": "I love listening to music from Celine Dion. In fact, I am in love with her songs. She is a Canadian singer and her full name is Céline Marie Claudette Dion. She was born in 1968. She had a struggling career and now she is one of the most famous singers in the world. This is a nice candidate task card for me and I will explain about her here.  \n\nCeline Dion is a pop singer and prefers melodious songs. But her songs are also influenced by several genres like rock, classical, gospel etc. Nonetheless, she is famous all over the world for her lucid voice and singing style. She is the singer who sings in several languages including French, Chinese, English, Italian, Latin, Japanese, and Spanish. She is also considered as the most influential and popular voice in the history of pop music. She is also popular for her vocal performance in the theme track of Titanic movie - My Heart Will Go On. Her popularity is skyrocketing and she won five Grammy Awards for her outstanding performance. She turned in to the second best-selling female singer in the USA. She was also honoured for selling over 50 million albums in Europe in 2003.\n\nCeline Dion is popular among the people who have crossed their 20s. In fact, to realize the meaning of her song lyrics, a listener needs to be of a certain age. Her songs are not associated with musical noise only and they have some special inner meaning. Accordingly, she has become a popular singer and I am also a fan of her for some reasons. The most important thing about being her fan is her voice. It attracts me. Besides, her devotion to her musical career also requires attention. All such reasons have made her favourite to me."

    "Answer": "Living in a city isn’t exactly my favourite thing to do. But, since a city is where I grew up and spent most of my life, I just don’t have much of an option to leave the city and permanently settle in a village. But, I love the village, I really do, so I try to get out of city life and travel to a village just I did about a year ago or so.\n\nThe village is located about a couple of hundred kilometres away from the town where I live. I remember travelling to this village a couple of times in my childhood as my father had taken me there to visit one of his childhood friends from high school. By the way, this childhood friend of my father, who I passionately call Ranju uncle, has always been good to me and treated me like one of his sons. In fact, I would never forget those childhood days of mine when he would visit our home and brought me all kinds of goodies and gifts for me.\n\nOf course, after that, both of my father and uncle Ranju parted from each other because of professional reasons, but those good days and memories have always been in my mind. So, one day, when I got an opportunity to meet that dear uncle of mine after so many years, I just didn’t want to let that opportunity pass. So, as soon as I heard from my Ranju uncle, I immediately bought a train ticket and decided to use my long holiday to meet with a very favourite person of mine.\n\nAnyway, after arriving that village of my uncle (who was retired by then) after such a long time, I felt like my childhood time is brought back to me once again as I found the same beautiful and green village. I also liked the fact that the ponds, where I swam once, were still there. Besides, I could still see the same roads on which I walked and ran except, of course, they were wider and paved with pitch. All in all, it was a great experience."

This village is in the north part of the country and falls under the …. (…Say a division or state or country name…). This village is situated beside the (…say a river name...) and has more than 10 thousand inhabitants.\n\nI went there in my childhood with my parents and the latest visit was in the last January with my mother. This village is almost 125 kilometres away from the place we currently live in. First, we took a train to reach the station of the district/state/ country where my grandfather’s village is and from the station we took a taxi to reach the river port of our village. There we took a boat and finally we walked 1-2 kilometres to reach the village.\n\nMy grandfather has passed away a few years back and my grandmother, 2 of my uncles 2 aunts and their children still live in this village. Apart from our family members, the farmers and workers who work for my uncles, live there.\n\nThis, in my opinion, is the most beautiful village I have ever been to. My forefather lived there and my father spent his childhood and teenage there. So in terms of bonding, this is a very important place for me. My grandmother and some of the cousins are very fond of me and I mostly meet them in whenever I go there. So in terms of my relation to my origin and relatives, this is the village I admire most.\n\nBesides that, this is a very beautiful village that seems like a painting by a famous painter. The environment is calm and pollution-free, the green fields, fresh air and hygienic foods offer a very attractive reason for being there. The flowing river, the forest, the simple lifestyle of residence and my of my relatives are the main things I love about this village.\n\nThere are very few things that I dislike about this village and the village itself has nothing to do about it. Like the education facility and treatment facility of this village is very poor and primitive. That’s something bothers me a lot."

    "Answer": "My recent experience in a village area in Russia has amazed me. I had to visit Esso in Kamchatka for some research purposes. The village is around 6500 kilometres far away from Moscow and filled with the wilderness. The indigenous people mostly live in this village and surrounding areas. This is a nice candidate task card and I am happy to have it. I will describe the village now.\n\nRecently I have completed my graduation from a local university in Russia and had to complete the research on indigenous people. As part of the research, I went there with some of my batch mates. Travelling to the place was really interesting. We used an aeroplane, boat, and local transportations to reach there. But I enjoyed the journey to and from Moscow. In fact, I have never travelled so far before.\n\nThe majority of the people in the village are indigenous and belong to the groups of the Itelmens, the Evenks, and the Koryaks. They live in peace and harmony here. Besides, there are some other people who also live in line with the locals and mostly deal with tourists. They help the tourists and assist in planning tours around the areas. The indigenous people are also cooperative. They helped us in many ways and provided the required information for us that we used in our research.\n\nHonestly, I like the nature most. The way of living in the village was the other interesting thing for me. the exotic location, volcanoes, hot springs, rivers etc. everything was wonderful and charming indeed. Riding on the mountain was another adventurous task that I took part in. Even the foods were delicious as well. So, I liked the area much and planning to pay another visit there."

    "Answer": "I have always believed that being brave means being afraid of nothing. The two go hand in hand. First is the fear, then the determination not to be ruled by it is what I called “bravery”. So, I will always choose to face fear, in order to conquer it, for how else we could possibly make true progress in life? Today, I would like to talk about one such person who is not afraid to face his fear.\n\nThe brave person, I am talking about, is a distant cousin of mine who is about 35 years old. He is about 5 years elder than me, and I have always found him to be a very positive, confident and brave person.\n\nWhether it is with standing up for a person who is being picked on unjustly, standing against racism or prejudice or taking a stand against the unfair social and economic practice, my distant cousin has always proved his worth as a brave person. I guess, by now, you have a pretty good idea about the profession of this person.\n\nBut, if not, I will tell you what he really does, and he is a Journalist – a brilliant and courageous journalist with a very big heart.  Trust me, being a good and objective journalist is not an easy thing in these days because there always is a risk of being targeted unfairly by some crooked and anti-social elements against who a journalist chooses to run his pen, knowing that there are risks.  Anyway, the bravery of my cousin achieved a new dimension when he refused a good-paying job. Well, trust me, it takes some guts for a person to refuse a job that pays at least 5 times more than his current job, but my cousin did just that.\n\nAnyway, I have already mentioned above what exactly my cousin a brave person. But, aside from that, I would like to say that it is his determination to always remain truthful and objective in all kinds of adverse situations for the sake and benefit of his society certainly makes him a very brave person in my eyes."

She lost her parents when she was only 14 and after that, she had taken life as a challenge. Strangely, with her bravery and determination, she has established herself as a successful Doctor. She did an extraordinary job to be able to get admitted to the top-notch State-owned Medical College and achieved a promising result in her medical years.\n\nShe is my mother and I know her even before I started my breathing in this world. I have been living with her for my whole life and she is very close to me. She is the person I consider as my role model. I admire her very much and I have never seen her compromise with rights and justice.\n\nBy profession, she is a doctor and she is, in fact, a very renowned doctor in our locality. She is popular for her benevolent character and bravery. People often seek her advice when needed. She treats the poor people for free and even purchases medicine for them with her own money. Besides, she is a doting mother of 3 children and a loving wife of my father. It amazes me how she perfectly balances her professional and personal life.\n\nHer life was a challenge for her and she has faced almost all of the adversity the luck can through to someone. Facing these adversities and successfully overcoming them is a very challenging job. She has done that with bravery and intelligence. Sometimes facing a problem in life and making a good solution is even harder than facing a fierce wild animal and in this perspective, my mother has faced many demons and defeated them all. In her personal and professional life, she is a brave and exemplary character. I have seen her fight with politically powerful leaders to establish the right of a poor girl, mother or working-class people. That requires gut and nerve and my mother has these all."

In his personal life, he is honest and benevolent. But when it needs to be vigilant, he jumps into the acts and makes the things done which is not even imaginable to others. This is a great cue card for me and I will describe the matter here.\n\nMr Simpson lives in my opposite apartment. He is now a government official. Being a jolly person, he loves to socialize. He is really a heroic person and his tasks of bravery are now legend. In his young days, he used to be a boxer and won several national and international awards. Since he is expert in unarmed combat and does not care for the troubles which are considered dangerous by the commoners.\n\nMr Simpson is a government official and works in the foreign affairs section. Before getting engaged with the government job, he was an instructor for unarmed combat and ran a school to teach mixed martial art. But suddenly he changed his track and joined the government service. Now he seems happy with the job. But it should be admitted that he is a bold person on some grounds. In fact, I am one of the witnesses of his bravery. The way he rescued a little girl from a fire-gutted apartment was adorable. He was the only man who risked his life to save the little girl. It shows how much courage a man needs to jump in a closed apartment to rescue a life. Based on the matters, I think Mr Simpson is a lionhearted person."

    "Answer": "My country, (...say your country name...), exports a number of items to different countries as they all help grow our economy. Ready-made garment products, jute, tea, medicines and sea- fishes are some of these export items that my country heavily relies upon. But, among them, Ready-made garments are certainly far ahead of the other items, so I will go ahead and talk about it today.\n\nThis Ready-made garment industry started its journey as a manufacturer of a very important export item of our country somewhere around the early 80’s when only a few entrepreneurs took the initiative to start manufacturing different kinds of garment products after importing all the raw materials, needed to manufacture them in their small manufacturing plants, from abroad, in addition to importing machinery and tools also.\n\nSince then, my country didn’t really have time to look back because the demand for our ready-made garments kept growing and growing among foreign buyers. All the importers of this item needed to do was to tell the manufactures from my country about how many clothing items and accessories they needed, what kind of fabrics would need to be used in them, and what the sizes of the clothing items were, and in no time, the products would be ready for shipment. Initially, of course, there weren’t enough skilled workforces in this garments sector, so the manufacturers had to actually train a lot of people to do the job before the huge number of unskilled and semi-skilled young people became interested to work in this booming sector.\n\nAnyway, it is an important export item because it is this very item (clothing items in general) that help increase our foreign currency reserve to an amount that my county could never even dream about it before. And, as the reserve of our foreign currency grew, the government became more flexible in running different kinds of development projects and economic activities of my country for the benefits of its people even more. Besides, this important export item has also helped create a huge amount of employment opportunities, especially, for the poor and less-privileged people of my country."

    "Answer": "There are quite a few significant export items we have in our country which bring a large portion of our total foreign revenue and help up boost up our overall economy and among them, I would like to talk about the tea we export to more than 20 countries. In our country, a vast area is used for growing tea plants and the quality we produce for war and packet tea is world-class. This is, in fact, one of the top 5 gross foreign earning export items for us.\n\nThe tea is mainly produced in the hill track and low area of the southern part of our country where we have a large number of farmers working on that. The weather, rain and land required for good tea productions are available in this part of the country and we have many industries there to collect and produce the finest tea.\n\nThe tea gardens are owned by either individuals or government and they engage a large number of farmers to work on the tea gardens. After the tea leaves are ready to be collected, the farmers and other workers collect those leaves, clean it and then send it to the factories there those leaves are processed and after rigid quality assurances and strict guidance, those are made ready to be packed.\n\nThe tea industry is a vast area where lots of people in different sectors are involved including farmers, caretakers, factory workers, manufacturers, engineers, QA, food officers, packing workers, transportation and preserving workers. Besides these, the owners and their appointed officers and employees also work in this industry.\n\nTea is one of the major foreign revenue-earning sources for our country and we produce high-quality products. Around 2% of our total population is directly involved in this sector and this has created a huge job opportunity. Moreover, this industry is expanding year by year and we are getting more countries on our export list. In terms of a major production of our country, job opportunity, foreign revenue earning, tea is a very important export item for us."

    "Answer": "Paddy is one of the most special agricultural crops in my country and it is exported around the world. I would like to thank you for this topic. As I was saying, Paddy is processed and we get rice which is the staple food in many countries of the world. The preparation process of paddy is a bit complex. The land is needed where the seeds need to be planted. But the land must be plain and should come with irrigation facilities. Irrigation is one of the most important matters for growing paddy but excessive water may damage the plants as well. It takes around three to six months for harvesting the paddy based on the paddy types.   \n\nUsually, farmers are responsible to grow paddy. They work day and night to grow the paddy. In fact, without their direct assistance, it is really impossible to grow the paddy. Planting the seeds is a difficult task. The farmers start planting the paddy early in the morning. The work hard throughout the day to take care of the paddy. Before planning the paddy, they also need to level the soil and use fertilizers to make the land fertile. And after planning the seedlings, they have to wait till the paddy becomes matured for harvesting.  \n\nPaddy is an important export item for my country. We produce a huge amount of paddy and after meeting our local needs, we export the crop in the world market. Actually, my country is one of the leading countries for exporting paddy. We also have some other agricultural crops but they do not grow in plenty. We need to import them to meet our needs. But it would have been difficult for us if we did not have paddy to export. Thus, paddy has become a great source of revenue earning. And so, its importance is huge."

    "Answer": "The roads and streets in my city are full of different kinds of common vehicles, such as buses, three-wheeled motors and, of course, motorbikes as well. While I don’t mind using other types of vehicles, I certainly prefer to ride a motorbike – my own motorbike that is – which I have owned since the days I finished my university.\n\nThe sport motorbike – I own – is not a new motorbike by any stretch of the imagination but it certainly works and is as versatile as it can be since it seldom gives up on me. Anyway, as I have already mentioned that it is an old, clunky motorbike from the Japanese Honda company which I bought as a second-hand motorbike about 12 years ago.\n\nThe motorbike has a small frame but its suspension and safety anti-skid braking system are of top class, so I don’t really have to worry too much about the road condition. Besides, since it has a small frame, it is easy to control and carry my motorbike. By the way, for an old motorbike, it still has a good fuel-efficiency rate since I can ride (and trust me, I ride my motorbike almost every day) around my whole town for almost an entire week, whether going to my work, travelling to a grocery store, or travelling to a café at the far end of my town, and I would still have some petrol left in the tank of my motorbike. Besides, since the motorbike doesn’t require that much maintenance works, except some occasional oil filter and spark plug changes, the cost of travelling with my motorbike is not really that much.\n\nAnyway, I use this motorbike often to commute, primarily because it offers me the flexibility and freedom to travel to the places of my choice at my own pace. Besides, the cost of riding my motorbike is comparatively cheaper than riding a bus or other types of vehicles. Finally, I often commute in it because of the adrenaline rush and joy, I get, from riding this motorbike, it is not really possible with other types of vehicles."

Though the bus is the most common transportation system in my city, there are so many people who use the underpass trains to reach to their schools and workplaces.\n\nI use trains almost 5-8 times a week to reach my workplace/ university. While returning home, I take the taxi as the train schedule in the evening contradicts my schedule. The train is much cheaper than the public bus or taxi in my city. Since I do not own a car I need to rely on the public transportation systems and the train costs only a few dollars per week. Someone can have a train pass for the whole month only for 50 dollars and this would allow him/her to travel to any places within the city as many time as he/she needed.\n\nThe train station is in walking distance from my living place and that’s the primary reason I prefer this transportation to reach my university/ workplace. I do not have to wait for a long and usually, I can get a moderate seat in it. There is no traffic jam to kill my time on the road and that’s another important reason for my preference for this train transportation system. Finally, I can save a great deal of money using the train over the taxi or other types of transportation systems.

They use this vehicle mostly to reach short distances. I am glad to have this special cue card for me and now will explain the matter in brief.\n\nI need to use this vehicle frequently. In fact, I am a college student and need to move to my college every morning. My college is not far away from my residence. So, I need to ride on a rickshaw to reach my college. Besides, I also take rides on this vehicle when I need to move inside the city and cannot manage to ride on public transports. Besides, the rickshaw is considered an environment-friendly transport as it does not emit any fumes.\n\nThe cost of riding a hiring a rickshaw is moderate. The rent varies based on distances. But the cost is more if I consider it with the fare of public transports. Usually, it takes around rupees 15/20 to reach a distance like about one or half a kilometre. But when it is long distance, the passenger needs to negotiate with the rickshaw puller. In most of the cases, they demand a higher fare than the usual if not negotiated.\n\nI use this vehicle often for some reasons. The most important thing about riding a rickshaw is it helps to sit comfortably and independently. Riding on public transports is really a troublesome matter. The number of seats is limited but the buses are overcrowded. Hence, it is inconvenient for females like me to struggle in the morning rush to grab a seat amid hundreds of other people. Moreover, riding a rickshaw also helps to reach the destination in due time as it directly starts for the destination after being hired. So, I often use rickshaw."

After checking some sunglasses there, I finally chose the one I liked, and that was my first pair of sunglasses.\n\nUp until then, of course, I never really seriously thought about buying one of those. But that year, I found out that the sun was unusually a bit too bright for my eyes, so I thought that buying a pair of sunglasses would be a good idea in order to protect my eyes from the bright sun.\n\nNow, I must say that I am glad that I actually bought that pair of sunglasses because I use them not only during the bright summer days but also at other times. In fact, these sunglasses have become a fashionable item for me whether I am riding on a motorbike with my friend to eat at a restaurant, attending a wedding ceremony or going to a stadium to watch one of my favourite football matches. Sometimes, I even wear them to my work.\n\nBy the way, the sunglasses, I wear, are of beautiful and light amber colour which are firmly set within a shiny blue colour frame. The oval shape sunglasses, that I currently use now, are a bit on the expensive side, but I don’t mind it since they look really nice on me.\n\nAnyway, I really like my sunglasses since they make me feel good about myself when I am around other fashion-conscious people. Besides, it also makes my eyes feel comfortable when I go out on a bright sunny day as well as a windy one. Sometimes, I even feel that this pair of sunglasses of mine is very much at the centre of my fashion since I try to buy other items, like my clothes and shoes, only when they match with those clothes, shoes and other fashionable items that I buy."

    "Answer": "I put on sunglasses when I am out and they are my most used fashion item. I love using my sunglasses for a few reasons and the glasses have become a constant companion to me.\n\nI frequently use sunglasses. But when I am inside the classroom at my college or home, I do not use it. Interestingly, when I first got the sunglasses, I used to wear them at home. Noticing the matter, my elder brother instructed me how to and when to use the sunglasses. He instructed me to use it outside of the home and particularly during the sunlight, I should use it to prevent my eyes from being exposed to the ultraviolet rays emitted from the sun. So, whenever I go out of home, I take this piece of fashion accessories with me.     \n\nI use sunglasses for various reasons. The most important cause behind having sunglasses is preventing the excessive heat of the sun. The dark blue glasses help to protect the eyes from the brightness of the sun. Actually, it is really difficult to look clearly during the day time when the sun is hot. Only a pair of sunglasses can relieve from the problem. Moreover, the ultraviolet ray contains harmful materials to human eyes. When someone wears sunglasses, the eyes are in a protected state. The ultraviolet rays cannot damage the eyes. Furthermore, style is an important issue to consider here. Sunglasses are available in various designs, colours and shapes. They also bring a different look in the face of the sunglass users.  \n\nI feel cool while using my sunglasses from a renowned brand. It makes me comfortable in my journeys out of the home. Moreover, they are of different styles and I look really good when I use it."

But unfortunately, despite our best efforts, almost everybody loses things just as I lost my pen drive (flash drive) about a few months ago.\n\nEverybody these days use a pen drive or flash drive, which is a small peripheral computer storage device which is used to save or store important files like - documents, pictures, movies or songs.\n\nNeedless to say, I also had many important files of some old movies, songs, documents and rare pictures of my family, friends and relatives from some time ago. In fact, I would say that some of those files were as old as 4 years that included the pictures and documents from my high school days. So, I guess that you can understand how valuable and dear that pen drive was really to me. But, unfortunately, I lost it one day on a rainy day when I probably tried to take the bus ticket out of my pocket (yes, I had the habit of carrying that pen drive to me to my work once in a while so that I could listen to some of my favourite songs from the old days there) in order to show it to the bus supervisor in a crowded bus.\n\nHowever, I didn’t realize that I had actually lost my favourite pen drive until after I had actually reached my home. I also figured out that I may have lost it on the bus, while I was on my way to the home because I clearly remember keeping it my pocket before leaving in my office.\n\nAnyway, after losing that little and favourite pen drive of mine, I felt like I lost a part of me because it contained many dear and valuable memories of mine from the past.

After an hour I left the bus and took a shared taxi. Finally, I walked for a while to reach home and when I entered my room, I felt that the bag is missing. I got so tensed and get back to the street and tried to remember exactly where I lost the item. But I could not remember exactly where I lost my bag.\n\nI felt so low and depressed that I could not sleep at night. Even though I knew that it was impossible to get the stuff back, I tried hard to have those items back. I reported to the nearby police station, contacted the bus authority but after 7-8 days I gave up all the hopes I had to get my items back. I felt like a child who lost his most important toys! The laptop was really important to me as it has lots of valuable study materials and other files. I felt so stupid that, I was blaming myself for the whole thing and rebuked me not to be more careful. Honestly, the whole experience and the feelings were pretty depressing."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for the opportunity you gave me to talk about my experience of losing something. In my preparation time for the given topic, I thought about many occasions when I lost something and finally I decided to talk about the experience I had when I lost my University ID card. In fact, I had to go through a series of events because I lost this ID card and probably that’s why I have remembered this event very clearly.\n\nI lost my ID card when I was in the 4th semester at my university.  I remember putting the ID card in my pocket while leaving home and to reach the University. I took a public bus and then a shared taxi on my way and I don’t know exactly where I lost it but noticed it while entering the library of my University where every student is advised to show his/her ID card. That’s the first time I noticed that the ID card is no longer is in my possession and I searched every possible place of my dress, bag and even in the classroom. But to my dismay, I could not find it anywhere.\n\nThis ID card was pretty important to me as it was required to enter the University building, library or even in exam rooms and labs. This was the only valid form of Identification Card that I had at that time to show anyone in case I needed to. Let’s say, if there is an emergency check post on the road, and the policemen ask me to show my identity, my ID card is the only piece of valid identification proof for me. So losing it was a disaster to me at that time.\n\nI felt pretty bad and was blaming myself for being such a careless person. I wrote an application to the University authority and they suggested me to make a General Diary to the nearest police station. I had to submit several applications and had to publish lost item news in the newspaper before I was issued another ID card after almost fifteen days. Meanwhile, I had to face lots of problems and had to submit several applications that made me remember this event pretty vividly."

    "Answer": "Some time ago, when I was still a high school student, one of my favourite teachers told me that you fail to plan for your future, you are actually planning to fail. Not to mention, of course, I really liked what my teacher had to me at that time. However, even though, the plan, I want to discuss here, doesn’t involve anything about my work, these valuable words still have some relevance to the noble plan I have. And the plan is to help people.\n\nAnyway, the plan, I am talking about, is to open a medical and healthcare clinic in my hometown where patients would be able to receive treatments by paying a very minimal charge. This clinic wouldn’t only treat all kinds of patients – patients who only live in my city – but also provide all kinds of diagnostic facilities. The clinic would also house at least 5 top-class specialist doctors from different medical fields.  By the way, I have had this plan deep in my heart for almost 10 years since the time I started to notice that medical treatment costs in my hometown, along with the rest of my country, were sky-rocketing fast. This high healthcare costs, in my opinion, was also contributed to the fact that more and more people moving into the city, where I live, from rural areas and thus constant pressure on the medical treatment facility that was already stretched before.\n\nAnyway, I know very well that implementing this plan of mine is going to be hugely challenging, primarily because I don’t have that kind of money with me. So, I would need to unite a group of rich but dedicate people to spend in the common cause of helping humanity which certainly is not going to be easy. Of course, my parents have a small piece of land in the town, so finding a proper place in the town for the clinic is not going to be an issue, but getting the permission for building this clinic from the proper government authority is also going to be a huge challenge."

    "Answer": "I have a plan to establish a playground for kids and a club for the adults in my hometown. This is something I missed a lot in the place where I grew up and that’s why I have the plan and determination to do exactly this.\n\nEstablishing a kid’s playground adjacent to a club for grown-up people would not be an easy task. I will need to manage the necessary budget, manpower and financial support to actually do that. I will have to be financially rich and connected with the local authority and political leaders to start the plan I have. Honestly, I have this plan for a very long. When I got admitted in my high school, the realisation started popping up in my mind that these are two things that our community is missing although they are very important. I knew that was something pretty tough to achieve, but yet I started fostering this tough plan in my mind.\n\nAs I already said, that would be pretty tough as it involves money, space, power, and people’s involvements. There would be lots of obstacles and I would have to face and resolve in order to fulfil the plan I have. The determination and goodwill along with the prudent decision would be required. If I do not possess great enthusiasm and strength of mind, it would become almost impossible to achieve it."

    "Answer": "Travelling fascinates me more than anything else. So, I want to travel in the future. I want to visit the other countries of the world and gain first-hand knowledge and experience. I would like to thank you for this wonderful cue card topic.\n\nTo meet my desire, I would need some specific things. The most important point about travelling is time. I need to manage enough time to spend out of my country. In fact, people cannot move out of their own states owing to the time deficiency. So, I have to manage plenty of times to travel around. Secondly, I would need a sufficient amount of money. Without a complete budget and arranging the money, it would be insane to move out to see the world around. So, I have to arrange money as well. Travelling with a companion is better and has some positive impacts. Hence, I also may need a companion for me.\n\nSince an early age, I am fond of books and have read various types of books so far. Most of the books were travelling and adventure related. I have an unquenchable thirst to see the world. So, the plan was hidden in my mind since my childhood. Gradually, the plan started spreading its wings in the mind. And now I dream to travel across the world.\n\nIn reality, it would be hard for me to fulfil the plan. First of all, I am unable to manage enough time to travel. In fact, travelling out of the country requires a great deal of free time and complexities. One needs enough time to handle the things but I do not have the time to invest in solving the issues. Arranging money is another fact. But I will try my best to organize everything even it takes five more years for me."

    "Answer": "My mother and sisters-in-law just love experimenting with different cooking ideas. So, it is quite natural that I get to try a lot of different kinds of foods at home, even though, I should say that I don’t necessarily like all of them. But, today, I would like to talk about a food item, my mother and sisters-in-law cook, which I really like.\n\nThe name of this food item is “Rogan Josh” which is an aromatic mutton dish of Persian origin. Rogan means “oil” in Persian while “Josh” means hot, boiling, or passionate\". So, together, Rogan Josh thus means cooked in hot oil at an intense heat.\n\nNow, I am not sure from where the ladies in my family got the recipe for this particular dish, but I am assuming that they might have got it from the many cooking shows that are aired on TV on a daily basis. But, regardless of where from or how they got it, the truth is, this is one of the most delicious and mouth-watering food items I have ever eaten.\n\nNow, in order to cook this delicious dish, one first needs to cook seasoned lamb in hot oil over high heat until the lamb is browned. After that, cook the onions separately for about 4 minutes until they become brown also. Then, add the ginger, garlic, curry, turmeric, cayenne and bay leaves with onions and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomato, yogurt and water; bring to a boil. Finally, mix the lamb with all the spices and simmer them over low heat until the lamb is very tender. Now, your Rogan Josh should be ready to serve with rice or “naan” bread.\n\nAnyway, I like to eat this food at home, mainly because the ladies at home cook it to perfection, unlike some of the restaurants where I have tried it. Besides, very few dishes manage to bring my family members together at one table in joys and happiness like this particular food."

    "Answer": "I like to eat fried rice with vegetable and fish curry at home. In fact, this is a common dinner item in our country and I often eat these items at home. Fried rice is prepared by boiling the rice and then fried with eggs and vegetables. Vegetables are mixed and prepared by using other spices and water. Finally, fish curry is cooked using the fish, spices, water, oil and salt. When these items are cooked individually, they are served together for either the lunch or dinner.\n\nAt our home, my mum mostly does the cooking stuff. She most of the time prepares this food item but sometimes my younger sister helps her cooking this item. The fried rice with egg, vegetable and fish are my most favourite menu. I eat this menu at least 4-5 times in a week and yet I never get bored with this menu. If I eat rich foods like Chinese menu or Thai menu 2/3 times in a week in a restaurant, I feel like not to have it again. But the menu I am talking about is quite delicious, tasty and nutritious. One will never feel uninterested eating it.\n\nThis is a common dish in our country and because of the geographical location we grow plenty of paddies, vegetables, and have lots of fishes in our rivers and ponds.\nMy mother has a special skill of cooking and the fried rice with vegetable, and fish curry she cooks is simply second to none. These are the main reasons for me to like this menu."

    "Answer": "I love to take paratha and mutton bhuna at home and this is a delicious menu. This is a great cue card topic to talk about and I feel lucky with this.\n\nThe preparation process of this food is simple. You will need some flours and prepare them accordingly to make the parathas. But cooking the mutton is a bit complex and takes more time than preparing the usual foods. You will need to clean the mutton properly before cooking and then apply some mixed types of spices with the meat. Preserving the prepared meat for half an hour will help the spices to get into the deep of the meat. Finally, put the mutton in the cooking pot with the expected amount of water. It needs almost half an hour to complete the cooking process.\n\nUsually, my mother is in charge of cooking at our home. But sometimes, I help her out in the preparation process. Besides, I also help mom when she falls sick and cannot continue the cooking for the family. In fact, cooking for a large family is really difficult and needs lots of preparations. So, often it becomes hard for mom to complete all the tasks. Further, the maid, who has been appointed for help in cooking, also is irregular. So, when it is about cooking the mutton and making the paratha, I extend my helping hand to my mother.      \n\nParatha and mutton have an especial appeal to me. The taste is different from the other types of food. And they do not make me feel bored. The paratha that I take is fried with a special type of oil which raises the taste while the mutton becomes tastier with the addition of potatoes. So, I like this food item very much."

    "Answer": "I and my cousins live in the same neighbourhood, and we usually like to go out every weekend and enjoy some nice meals at restaurants. Today, I would like to talk about one such meal that we enjoyed about a couple of weeks ago.\n\nIt was a Chinese meal called “Gong Bao Chicken” (with peanuts), and we ate it in one of the most popular and busiest Chinese restaurants in our town. Of course, we had eaten this meal on a number of occasions from this restaurant in the past, but on those previous occasions, it was only take-out since it is very difficult to get a table at this restaurant without waiting for a significant period of time. But, this time around, we were extremely lucky as we were actually offered a table near the window, just where I liked, and we didn’t have to wait even 10 minutes for it! By the way, this “Gong Bao Chicken” is a special chicken dish that is prepared after marinating the chicken in soy sauce and corn starch and adding deep golden brown, toasted peanuts in it.\n\nAnyway, as soon as we got our seats, we ordered for your favourite meal and asked the waiter to serve our Gong Bao Chicken really “well-done”. The waiter agreed and left us alone at our table. After waiting for about 15 minutes, the meal was served to us with steam rice. Not to mention, we finished eating our chicken meal by pushing the chicken pieces one after another into our mouths, until our mouths didn’t have any more room in them since it tasted so good!\n\nWell, we really enjoyed this particular meal eating outside in a restaurant because the restaurant had all the experience and skills to prepare the meal to perfection which wouldn’t probably be possible if we had cooked the meal by ourselves. Besides, it also allowed me and my cousins to have a good time together in our own space and time."

That was actually a get together short of a party with my school friends whom I have not met for a long in person. Over the phone, we talked and planned to have a meal cum get together party together to discuss us and to meet those friends in person. We picked the City Night Restaurant because it is in a suitable location for all of us and we knew the food quality of this restaurant was good.\n\nWe met at around 5 pm and we spent some good time together. Lots of things have changed and some of our friends have done many challenging things and we all enjoyed the stories and updated we gave each other. Four friends of mine from school came to this occasion and they were James, Jessica, Harper and Patrick (...or say names of your friends...)\n\nIt was a gathering we had been planning for a long and as part of our meeting, we planned to have a great feast. From the very beginning, we planned to have met in a restaurant and not at home. Usually arranging to get together type party at a restaurant is easier and more convenient than arranging it at home. No one feels shy or uneasy being at other's home and the host does not have to go through a big preparation. The friends who came at this gathering also liked the environment and foods of City Night Restaurant and that was the main reason we planned to have it outside our home."

    "Answer": "Thank you for this excellent cue card topic. It was a barbeque party at night on the rooftop of one of my friend’s home. It was a pleasant surprise for everyone present there as well. In fact, the event turned in to a birthday party for one of my besties. The event was arranged to surprise her, and Jessica was the mastermind of this event. She did not inform us about the party and only just invited us to be on her rooftop for a meal at night. It was a dinner and I took it at night though I reached the spot even before the dusk. The meal and the party were fantastic.\n\nTo be honest, actually, I forgot that it was the birthday of Samantha. Jessica was the organizer of the entire episode but she kept this a secret. Frequently, we meet her at her home and pass leisurely hours in the rooftop of her residence. So, she invited almost everyone including Mary (the birthday girl), me, Alvina, Anny, Amey, and Celia. We all had fun together and enjoyed the meals too. But the most surprising event was for Mary. She did not expect such a blast on this day.   \n\nUsually, I do not take foods out of my home except for some special cases. It was one of such cases and I participated in the party with my friends. Besides, Jessica also tempted and allured us all with the name of some special dishes like barbeque chicken, fried rice, soft beverage, grilled fish etc. The menu was really attractive. And there was another reason that I had been passing some busy moments with my academic studies. So, I needed a break and the meal invitation brought the desired break for me. Considering all the matters, I decided to take the meal out of my home."

    "Answer": "As a man, I don’t exactly have much fascination for wearing jewellery products or other fashionable items. However, when it comes to using perfumes, I spend a great deal of money on buying them.\n\nYes, I like perfumes and deodorants, and I am sure that many, many people around the world also adore perfumes, even though they don’t necessarily choose the same type of perfumes or scents. For example, while some of them like their perfumes to be strong, others like them to be mild. Then, there are those who like “body mist”. But, as far as I am concerned, I want my perfumes to be mild because strong perfumes give me a “headache”, especially, if I am in a closed environment.\n\nSo, again, mild perfume is what I prefer as long as it lasts longer. By the way, it is important to know that not all perfumes last a long period of time after putting them on our body or clothes because the concentration level of the aromatic compounds on all the perfumes are never the same. And just in case if you didn’t know, the higher is the concentration level of the aromatic compounds in a perfume, the more expensive they are.\n\nAnyway, I know exactly what kinds of perfumes I like to wear since I have been using it since my early high school days. But, I don’t really use it more than once a day or twice a day though, depending on whether I am just casually going out attending a party. But, one thing is for sure that I have to have my perfume on when I am going to my office.  \n\nSo, why I use perfumes? Well, the answer is obvious, and it is because they make me smell good, and when I smell good and fresh, I feel more confident about myself in the company of other people. On top of that, they also amplify my mood and thus making me more productive in what I do."

    "Answer": "I love to use perfumes and body sprays while going out for any purposes. This is a habit that I have been nurturing for a long time. It helps me to remain refreshed around the hours. Thanks a lot for this nice cue card topic.\n\nI frequently use both the scents and body sprays. But it depends on the circumstances whether I should use perfume or a body spray. I am a social worker and need to travel to different parts of the city and meet different types of people. So, I need to use perfumes and body sprays for various reasons. But when it is the day time, I prefer body sprays. And if it is nighttime, I like to wear perfumes.\n\nI mostly use it in the morning before leaving for my office. Sometimes I need to move on the city streets to check the real condition of society- this is a part of my job. At that time, I spray the perfume before moving out of my office for such purposes. I have a couple of extra bottles reserved at my office for such emergencies. When I was a child, I used to spray body sprays after I intended to go out either to meet my friends or to attend classes or anywhere. In fact, it was a must for me to spray the body spray on me. The habit still remains.\n\nI use perfume and body sprays for keeping myself revived. The delighting smells from the perfumes make me feel happy and I can get the mental satisfaction to focus on my work. The other reason is that it has become a habit for me. I cannot do without perfumes at all. Whenever I go out without wearing a perfume or body spray, I do not feel comfortable. So, I use it often."

    "Answer": "Thank you for such an interesting topic because, to tell the truth, I have always dreamt of receiving a large sum of money and buying many things with it. But, out of those many things, buying a large house certainly tops the list.\n\nHowever, that large house may not be in a common area, rather I would want it to be in a posh or distinguished area of my country where all the houses are built in an orderly fashion and that have large empty spaces and wide streets all around them. But, then, of course, not all posh areas are the same either, so I will have to look really hard to find the kind of posh areas I really like. And there could also be issues with the kind of large house I would really like. Therefore, there is no doubt in my mind that I will actually have to spend a lot of time and efforts to find what I would need in order to make sure that my money is well-spent. After all, you don’t always end up receiving a large amount of money.\n\nNow, since the issue of money “well-spent” has come up, I am assuming that I would need to spend at least 6 to 8 hundred thousand dollars to buy a large house in a posh area of my choice, depending, again, on what kind of house I really want and what kinds of amenities the house should have. But, one thing for sure is that that I would want to have a large swimming pool at my house.\n\nAnyway, I would like to buy a large house in an opulent area, mainly because it would give a boost to my status among my friends and relatives. Besides, it would also provide me with access to the types of employment opportunities and offices/industries that don’t exist anywhere else. Not to mention, of course, I can get a more walkable area in an elegant area which I have always dreamt of."

    "Answer": "I would like to buy a sports car if I receive a large amount of money. In fact, this is a kind of dream for me to have such a sports car with great speed. Besides, the muscular body and performance of the car are also striking. This is a great topic for discussion and I personally thank you for asking the question to me. I will describe the issue in brief now.\n\nAudi is one of the most prominent and muscular brands in the arena of the motor vehicle. This is the finest and gorgeous vehicle I have ever seen in my life. The sports car manufactured by this brand are also strong and performs much better than any other sports car. So, I want to buy an Audi R8 2020. This is a stunning sports car with a good number of facilities. Besides, the outlook of the car is also eye-catching and the driving experience is extraordinary.  \n\nThis is more expensive than most other sports car. The price range of the car is around $154,800 to $197,800. It mostly depends on the configuration of the car. But you can have the chance to get the car at a lower cost if you get the second-hand car. I think this is unwise to get a used car because most of the times the sellers sell such cars for defects or faults. They may not show you the faults but when you will come to know about the defects, it would be difficult for you to drive the car anymore. Hence, it should be considered before purchasing the car. Besides, there are some people who also try to get cars in instalment which is not also a great issue to consider. If you fail to provide the instalment amount anytime for uncertain reasons, it may bring a disaster for you.   \n\nUsing a sports car is really difficult in the usual roads. Most of the time, the drivers of the sports car cannot drive smoothly in the busy streets. In fact, the cars are manufactured to ply on the race tracks instead of the usual streets. Sometimes, the drivers feel perplexed to drive the sports car. They generate a great speed within a second and this is the greatest weakness of the cars while they are on the ordinary streets. So, I have a plan to drive the car in some places where would be no or fewer crowds. This is a bit of trouble to sort out such a location here in Canada. Besides, I can drive the car slowly in the streets. But in that case, I have to be very careful about the other vehicles around me. Controlling the speed with a sports car is a difficult task indeed.    \n\nI am to complete my graduation here and been using a Ford for the last couple of years to move inside the city. My car has become old enough to be sold at any junkyard. Its performance is also degrading gradually. In fact, I bought the car from a used car gallery. But it has served me very well comparing its price. Now, I am feeling the necessity of another car, and I have a plan to buy a brand new one. Price is a notable fact here but if I wait or get a large amount of money, it becomes easier for me to get the car."

But, then again, we should never take the idea of choosing a place to have our home lightly. At least, I don’t.\n\nAnyway, the Caribbean is the place where I would like to have my home- my dream home that is. Now, I have never really visited this place before, but from what I have known about it so far by watching TV and reading different kinds of travel magazines, I have no doubt in my mind that I want my home to be in one of the beautiful Caribbean islands. Besides, I have also learned a great deal about this beautiful place from a good friend of mine who has visited this place on a number of occasions.\n\nSo, anyway, what this place is really like? Well, to answer this question, this place is like a little piece of heaven on this earth with its blissfully pale shimmery stretches of sandy beaches and the sparkling crystal clear waters. Throw in the glorious weather and you have one idyllic holiday location, where the weather remains pretty good all year round. Besides, this is also a place of music and festivals which will give you the idea that people in the Caribbean don’t really become sad. However, above all of these, if I don’t talk how stacked up the Caribbean really is with mind-boggling natural beauty, where one can enjoy some of the most Paradise-Esque scenery in the world, I don’t think that I will do justice to this place.\n\nAnyway, I would like to have my home in this place, primarily because it has numerous beautiful spots that you can visit and see with a very little time and effort. Besides, the presence of some of the friendliest people on this earth, with a very laid-back and easy approach to life, in the Caribbean also convinces me to have a home there."

High-rise buildings, bumper to bumper traffic, incessant roar of buses, industrial zones which give me urban life cannot make me feel blissfully happy as peaceful countryside's life with its well worth seeing the landscape and the clearest air without any exhaust fumes.\n\nA place where I would like to have a home is one of the islands of Greece, Santorini. It is a place with breathtaking scenery where the sandy beach stretches along the skyline. Santorini is a city of quaint old buildings surrounded by narrow cobbled streets, where the update has been kept old traditions. The majority of buildings in this area are covered by white and blue colours, which gives the city a spectacular view.\n\nIf I am not mistaken a few years ago while watching a TV program I heard some information about this place that impacts me and then I started to search for something about this city on the internet.\n\nActually, my dream came true last year, when I travelled to Greece and could see this wonderful place which was much more attractive than I used to dream. If I will get a chance to have a house and lived there, I am going to accept it and run over there once and for all. I think I can set up a business there and make big money. Feeling stream winds, walking on golden sands, and every day watch at the panoramic beach that interflows with blue horizon can be the essential reason why I will choose to live there."

But still, there are some serene places where one can make a home of own to lead a happy and peaceful life. I will describe such a place from New Zealand.\n\nInvercargill is one of the most prominent cities of New Zealand. Despite being a city, this is the place where one can find peace of mind. This is one of the southernmost city in the world as well. The city is encircled with plains and rivers and thus has got an attractive look. The city has stunning streets and places for the citizens. On the other side, the rate of troubles is reduced in this city. It appears to me that this is a perfect city for a peace-loving human like me.   \n\nThe entire locality is filled with calmness. The streets are nicely decorated and take various looks in seasons. Furthermore, the city has some rich farmland and they also provide a stunning view from a distance. The large conservation lands are the other feature of this city. Besides, this is a commercial centre for the Southland region where a good number of people come to shop their daily necessaries and also marking various occasions. The beautifully decorated streets are named after the rivers which are also attractive. The place also contains a less population than it was supposed to be. As a result, the city is not crowded like the other cities. Moreover, the citizens are peace-loving and do not get involved in any unwanted troubles. They abide by the law completely. The transportation system is also advanced and accessible through various routes railway, road and air links. Everything is in the right position of this city which has increased the beauty of this gorgeous city, naturally.       \n\nI first came to know about the place through the internet. In fact, I had been seeking a suitable place for me and my family to settle down in my native land. As a result, I had been looking for a suitable city or place where I could live happily. While I was searching for New Zealand, I came to know about the city. Actually, this is one of the top cities of the country to live in happily. The features and natural beauties have attracted me. I have already visited the place several times and decided to buy some suitable places for my home. If everything goes well, I would be able to buy a piece of land in the city by June next. Then I will start building my two-storied home for me and my family.    \n\nYes, definitely I have to do something for living there. So, I have planned to continue my current business there. In fact, I own a medium-sized coffee shop in Sydney. But this is a very noisy and crowded place now. So, I have planned to shift from here and run my coffee shop in Invercargill. I have seen several coffee shops which are unable to meet the growing demands of the people. So, I have got a new plan and I will implement that with the coffee shop. Therefore, I think working will not be a problem for me. I think the local people in the city will support me for my decent living."

    "Answer": "I have thought of having different careers in the future, but none of them has remained viable for me for long due to the demand of time and situation. But, there is at least one career that has left its distinct appeal in my mind as an interesting career choice, and today, I would like to talk about that here.\n\nAnyway, this career, I have in my mind as a future career choice, is an International Relationship Analyst. Now, there is no doubt that this is certainly a very challenging career choice, and that’s probably why not too many people find it as appealing as many other jobs.\n\nBut, I think that the world today needs many more competent international relationship analysts because the world, and its countries, today is in much more chaotic situation than it was even before 20 years or so. And that’s probably why we can see that there are so many small pockets of war in different parts of the world. But, when there is no war, there are always efforts of the stronger countries to exploit the small and weak countries economically, culturally. Luckily, however, an expert international relation analyst can help the world get rid these issues by properly understanding the dynamics of the relationship among the countries while opening up new channels of effective communication among them. Besides, his or her role would also be to find the areas on which countries can cooperate with each other instead of focusing on their differences.\n\nBy the way, this future career choice of mine wouldn’t only help countries to eliminate their differences, but also will help me develop a better understanding about the tradition, culture and lifestyles of different groups and ethnicities.\n\nAnyway, I am interested in this career because I truly want to make a difference in this world by bringing people together in harmony from diametrically opposite ends. Besides, this career would also allow me to travel to different countries which I have always wanted."

    "Answer": "Today I am going to talk about my Dream Job for the future. I am going to tell you what the job is, what it involves and why I’d like to do it. My dream job would be to be a travel writer!\n\nTravel writers are often self-employed. They travel to interesting places and then write in magazines and newspapers. They also write articles about their experiences and publish them online. To do this job you have to be willing to go to lots of new places. You also need to be able to write fluently and in different styles for different publications. Travel writers must be very flexible, as you might need to go to difficult or uncomfortable places and to travel at short notice. Often travel writers need to have another job a well, as, unfortunately, you can’t really make a living out of this type of work.\n\nThe reason I would like to do this job so much is that I love going to new places. Coming to Vietnam has been a new and wonderful experience for me. I would enjoy telling other people what it was like and encouraging them to go on an adventure of their own. I also like communicating ideas in writing, it would be wonderful to make a living out of the two things I enjoy most – travel and writing!\n\nUnfortunately, there are very few opportunities to make a living as a travel writer, so I think it might have to stay as my Dream Job, rather than my Real Job! Even so, I think it is important to have a dream, because otherwise how can you ever have a dream come true!"

    "Answer": "Selecting a career is one of the most difficult things in life. If you cannot select the right path, you are to regret for the rest of your life. Considering all the issues, I have selected my future career. After completing my academic studies, I will move to make my dream come true. I want to be a noted musician and now will describe the issue here.\n\nThe job of a musician is not so easy as it appears. We are highly amazed by the songs or music we listen in different places or occasion. But few of us know that it is really difficult to make the tunes with attractive rhythms. In fact, it is hard to operate all the musical instruments and composing song lyrics is more difficult. This is a type of challenge that everyone cannot confront. So, I have decided to be a musician and create some of the best music of the time.      \n\nTo be a musician, one needs to focus on some specific issues. First of all, knowledge of musical instruments is a must. The knowledge should be complete. The musician should be able to play almost all types of instruments spontaneously. On the other sides, the musician should also be skilled in creating unique lyrics. Music composition is the other preferable activity for the musician. So, it appears that the musician is involved with a good number of activities. Once the activities are done perfectly, there are chances that the musician would be able to create something special for his/ her audience. By the same time, the musician should also need to practice a lot with the instruments. When the musician will be performing at any venue, he should play the instruments in the right way. And thus, there are no alternatives to practising.\n\nI have chosen to be a musician in my career for various reasons. I love music. Listening to music is my greatest hobby. Based on the hobby, I have started thinking to take it as my career. With the thought, I planned accordingly and dreaming of being a reputed musician. By the same time, I have started learning several musical instruments. I have started learning to play guitar and drums. Gradually, I will move for other instruments like flutes etc. Classical music attracts me more but in the present age, the demand for classical music is on the decline. So, I will try to focus on the other demanding aspects of music. I do not wish to earn money from this job as I have plenty of wealth from my family. This is a passion for me. I want to spread my tunes across the country and the world as well. With the dream to be a famous musician, I have taken this career.       \n\nThis is an interesting job in many aspects. When someone becomes a musician, the majority of people become familiar with the person. S/ he is treated with respect. By the same time, it brings huge fame for the person which is not possible for any ordinary individual to gain. Influencing people is the other outcome of this profession. When you will talk in any forum, your statement will be prioritised. Actually, the fame you will have will make you acceptable to all strata of society. You will have access to anywhere you want and life will be easier and enjoyable for you."

    "Answer": "Today I am going to talk about my current job when I am at home in the UK. I will tell you what the job it, what it involves, why I chose it and why I am interested in the role. My job title is Careers Adviser. I do not think you have this job role in Vietnam!  A Careers Adviser provides information, advice and guidance to help people make realistic choices about their education, training and work. I work at a university, but some Careers Advisers work in schools.\n\nMy job involves talking to students about their ideas for the future. I help them to identify what skills they have and link this to possible career ideas. Because there is only one of me, and there are a lot of students I also deliver a lot of group work sessions for students. For example, I might run a series of workshops on topics such as Employability: Understanding your skills; How to research career ideas; Where to look for jobs; How to write a great CV or How to do well at Interviews.\n\nIf I’m very honest I didn’t really choose my job, it chose me! When I was a student I had no idea what I wanted to do. I did lots of different jobs and wasn’t very happy in any of them. Then I went to meet a Careers Adviser, and thought ‘I’d love to do that’. Spend my day talking to people about how they can get from where they are now to where they’d like to be in the future!’\n\nTo become a Careers Adviser I had to do one year’s training full time, and a further year ‘on the job’. Later on, I did another postgraduate course to gain even more knowledge.\n\nThe job is rewarding and fun, but it can be hard too. I like to help people and I enjoy discussing their ideas. The best bit of the job is when a student I have been working with comes and tells me because of my help they have got a job that is the first step on the way to a brilliant future career! I hope one da all of you get your dream jobs too."

    "Answer": "I presently work with one of the largest food shops in the USA as a part-time salesman. This is an interesting job for me, and I am involved with the job for past one and a half years. The working hours are convenient for me. I will narrate the job and other matters now and thank you for asking my such a remarkable question.\n\nI have the job of a salesman. I do the things that an ordinary salesman does. But the job is interesting in some other senses. Meeting with newer people is my hobby. Being a salesman, I got this opportunity to meet with people every day. I observe them and get amazed with the ways they talk and act. In fact, this is a kind of observation that I like to do most. I need to remain busy with selling purposes and thus I have plenty of chances to meet and greet people of different strata who come at the shop.\n\nMy duties at the shop are limited. I need to stand behind a counter and serve with the necessary orders from the customers. Sometimes, I also assist the customers with suggesting the best types of foods marking their needs and requirements. Besides, I am also responsible for collecting the payments from them. This is a flexible job for me and provides with some special opportunities as well. My other responsibilities also include being alert about fraudulent activities. Once I detected a fraud who tried to escape without paying the price of the purchased products and since then it has been assigned to me. In fact, I use my observation power for this purpose. At the end of the day, I return home by executing all my responsibilities.\n\nI have picked this job considering some important issues. This is a convenient job for me. As I am a student, I am unable to hold a full-time job. It will hamper my academic activities. Further, my parents will also disallow me to get involved into a full-time job. By the same time, it is also hard to get a full-time job for an undergraduate like me in the USA. The job market is shrinking in the country which is also responsible for me to get a part-time job. The most important thing about the job is that it provides me a lot of flexibility. If I need to attend classes in the evening, I inform my supervisor on the previous day and he arranges everything. Then I attend the shop in the morning. But my usual hours begin at 4.00 PM and ends 9.00 PM. But there are no such flexibilities in a full-time profession. Moreover, the payment that I get as salary is enough to support my educational expenses and others.   \n\nAs I have already mentioned, I love to observe people and try to guess about them. This is the job that wants me to interact with lots of people every day. So, I have the chance to observe them. On the other side, I get a decent salary as a part-timer and get the payment before the pay day. This is an important aspect for me to bring under consideration. After completing my graduation, I will seek for something else and till then, I have the plan to continue the job. I am in love with it."

    "Answer": "Today I am going to tell you about a common form of transport that I use in the city where I live.  What it is, when I use it, what it is like and why I choose to use it. I am going to tell you about buses in Sheffield where I live, this is a form of public transport that many people use to travel to and from work or around the city at night.\n\nI live in a city called Sheffield.  There can be a lot of traffic in the city, and it is difficult to find anywhere to park if you use your own transport.  Therefore, many people prefer to use the public buses.  There are lots of buses in Sheffield and many bus stops.  There is a bus stop almost directly outside my house.  Buses come past every 15 minutes, if you want the bus to stop, you have to put out your hand to signal the driver or the bus will go straight pass!  When I get on, there is a fixed fare as I have a special travel pass.  It costs me £1.20 for every journey, however far it is.  That is about 39,000 VD.  There are bus stops every 500 metres or so, if there are people waiting, the bus will stop, if not, the bus goes straight on.  The bus has two levels, a top deck and a bottom deck.  I like to climb up the stairs to the top deck and sit right at the front of the bus.  Then you get great views across the streets and the city too.\n\nI use the buses all the time because they are cheap, convenient and safe.  I sometimes use the bus to get to work, but mainly I use the bus when I am out at night, as it will get me home safely.  The buses run quite late, but you have to be careful to catch the last bus home or it will be a long walk back!"

    "Answer": "Transportation inside Russia is easier than any other countries of the world for many reasons. The wide road networks have primarily made it possible. Besides, transportation to places is comfortable as well. I am proud to have the chances of enjoying the services. Metro service is one of the commonest forms of transportation inside Moscow. I will describe the service in detail here.\n\nThe Moscow Metro is a popular mode of transportation for the city commuters to travel to different places. This is a speedy mode of transportation and carries the passengers to their destinations at the right time. The transit system supports the entire Moscow in line with supporting to the other neighbouring localities. This is an underground railway that has won the heart of the people for the efficient service system. Besides, the length of this system has made it one of the longest underground railway systems in the world. A wide number of stations has made it possible to commute thousands of people each day from place to places.\n\nThe trains running on the Metro are like the usual trains but there is a basic difference between them. In most cases, the trains run on the rail tracks installed on the ground. But in this metro, the rail tracks are installed under the ground. Besides, they are more comfortable and free of hassles. So, a good number of commuters use this transportation method for their regular commuting. The train moves faster like a bullet using the underground tunnels. They stop in the required stations for a few minutes and then move again to the next destination. The lines are spread from Moscow to other outlying areas. As a result, the stations are always crowded either by the inbound or outbound passengers. Since they are a state-run train, the government takes the right care for everything.\n\nI mostly use the train during my office hours. I work at a Russian outsourcing company. I live in Moscow and my office is located in Saint Petersburg. So, moving to office early in the morning with bus or other public transports is difficult for me. Rather, using the underground railway is far better and much more comfortable than waiting in a bus queue. Besides, returning home is also easier for me in the evening when the office hour is done. In fact, I use the transportation for moving to and returning from office. When I joined at the office, it was a bit difficult for me to attend office from Moscow and return from Saint Petersburg. I had to spend lots of hours on the road for the transportation purpose. But when I started using this railway service, it became easier for me. The former troubles of waiting and unnecessary time spending are gone now.  \n\nI picked the Moscow Metro as my transport because of its speedy mode. Yes, the other vehicles also move fast, but this is faster. It takes around 35/ 40 minutes for me to reach my office including the f-minutes’ walk from the station to the office. Besides, this is a cheap mode of transportation for me as well. Earlier, I had to spend a smart amount of money to reach my office but it was not possible for me always to reach there in time. But after adopting the Moscow Metro as my transportation system, I have been able to save a notable amount of money from my transportation cost. Furthermore, the trains are spacious and convenient than the other forms, I think. Considering all the matters around, I have selected this one as my way of regular transport."

    "Answer": "Today I am going to tell you about a trip I made by public transport. I will tell you when and where I went, what transport I used, a little about the trip and why I chose to use public transport.\n\nThe trip was made about five weeks ago. Can you guess where I was going? I was leaving my home in Sheffield, England, to come to Vietnam!\n\nTo make this journey I had to use lots of different forms of transport. The first part was by car – a friend gave me a lift to the coach station. The coach I was travelling in went overnight, so it was very late, very cold and very dark when I arrived at the coach station. I was glad my friend was with me. The coach arrived at midnight, and the driver was tired and a bit cross. He was quite rude to all the passengers which I and my friend thought was funny! My backpack was put in the compartment under the coach, and I climbed on board. There were lots of empty seats on the coach, so I sat at the front and had two all to myself. I tried to sleep but it was uncomfortable and I was excited, so I didn’t really get any sleep at all. The coach stopped a few times over night so people could get on and off. At one point the driver changed, and a new friendlier driver came on board.\n\nOur destination? It was Heathrow Airport, this is a huge international airport near to London. The journey to London took about 6 hours. I was very tired when I arrived in the early morning at Heathrow, but I knew that when I got on my plane, then the next step in my adventure would begin!\n\nAlthough I do have my own car, I try to use public transport whenever I can. I think it is better for the environment and also less stressful. However, for this trip, I had no choice.  I was going away for a long time, so I would not be able to leave my car at the airport for so many months. I wonder what my next journey will be?"

    "Answer": "Just after I graduated from the high school, I made a remarkable trip to Barcelona and I took a train and finally shared a yacht on this trip. It would be probably 2014 when I had this journey and I was about 16 years old at that time.\n\nBarcelona was around 4 hours journey from our home and I went there with my family. Every year we visit different parts of or country and sometimes outside the country. This time my father wanted to have a trip to enjoy the holidays and to celebrate my graduation from high school. He asked me whether I would be interested in having this trip and I had no reason to say no.\n\nIt was summer and we decided to visit somewhere nearby but suitable for the season. This is why we had this trip to Barcelona. The train journey was quite comfortable and we enjoyed spectacular views on our journey. We checked in a hotel after we reached near the sea and stayed there 3 days.\n\nThe beautiful views of the skyline and iconic landmarks from the yacht made our trip memorable. I had been to this place once in my childhood but the pleasure of enjoying the picturesque view with my family, meeting foreign tourists, enjoying seafood, celebrating my graduation were something quite different. After I had this trip, I visited a few other places but none of these places could be compared the fabulous experience I had on this journey. Our decision to take public transportation was proven to be a wise decision.  Since my father had to get back to his office, we could not stay more than 3 days but deep inside me, I wished I could stay a little longer. All in all, it was a very fantastic journey and we enjoyed it a lot.\n\nI bought a few toys for my nephews and nieces who could not join us on this trip. I had to share my experience of this tour with them and tell stories about our journey. While planning for this trip, we decided we would rather take a train than taking our private car. There were basically two reasons for that. First, I did not want to drive all the way and second I did not want to miss the spectacular views of the roadside. We shared the yacht because hiring the whole yacht was quite expensive. Using the public transportation like the train and shared yacht also reduced our cost. Hopefully, I will make this trip once again someday."

    "Answer": "My recent visit to Mumbai from Kolkata was excellent. The experience will be remembered ever as I used a public transport for this trip. Before this trip, I had the experience to travel in public transports in India but for not such a long time. I will describe the trip in brief now.\n\nThe journey began from a railway station in Kolkata and the destination was Mumbai. In fact, it was a business trip for me. I am a sales executive of a local pharmaceutical company. And I was sent to Mumbai from Kolkata to make an analysis of the market and set the strategies how our company will create chances to enter into the market of Mumbai. So, I was sent to gather data and other available resources or information for the purpose. The trip took place in the mid of last February. The trip lasted for a week and I entirely enjoyed this one.      \n\nI had to use various types of transports on this trip but the most noted one is the rail service. I started the journey from Kolkata station on a mail train. The journey began at night and ended in the middle of the next day. Throughout the journey, I had to use some other public transports like bus, taxi and train. The key journey was done by the train while I had to ride on taxi and other vehicles as well. I also liked the taxi ride in Mumbai and the experience was moderate. The entire locality, I found, was crowded like it is in Kolkata. So, the movement was a bit difficult inside the city. But the train journey was completely different. It was a non-stop journey for over 12 hours. Everything was in order on this journey.      \n\nThe trip was successful in several terms. Firstly, I wanted to gather information about the local pharmaceutical market in Mumbai. Luckily, I managed all the necessary information I needed. On the other side, I enjoyed visiting some of the most wanted places in the city when I managed some leisure hours. I had to move the city markets, meeting with businessmen and visiting retail pharmacies that sell medicines in retail. Besides, I also had to set up the strategies at the end of the day for the next day. The communication system in Mumbai is really developed but the number of vehicles plying on the street is more than the spaces on the road. As a result, traffic congestions in some major points of the city is a common phenomenon.   \n\nI used the public transport for some certain reasons. Firstly, the public transports are the comfortable means of communication and the travelling cost is cheaper. But the facilities they provide are really adorable despite the cheaper costs. I selected railway to travel to Mumbai as I always enjoy the train journey. The journey is continuous and the travellers do not need to get bored. Further, there are some other benefits like you can move freely inside the train which is not possible for the other types of public transports. I took public transports in the city as well because there were no other alternatives of such transports as well. The trip was a very good one for, and the events will be vivid in my mind for many days."

I will tell you what it is, what it can do, how I use it and why it is important to me.\n\nThe item that is important to me is my laptop!  I am not very knowledgeable about technology, so I can’t tell you anything about its specifications.  However, I can tell you that it is very light and easy to carry around.  It has both a keyboard and a touch-screen and since starting my travels it has become my best friend!\n\nMy laptop has all the Microsoft office packages like Word and PowerPoint, it also has a big memory and can give me access to Skype and the Internet. I use my laptop every day for work.  It helps me professionally in my job as an English teacher because I can use it to devise lesson plans, carry out research on new topics, and keep up to date with news and issues of relevance to my area of work.  I also use my laptop every day for personal things.  I can contact my friends by email; chat to others using Skype – if there is a strong enough wi-fi connection – and I can save all my photos of this beautiful country that I am working in at the moment Vietnam, safely on my computer.\n\nI am from England, before I came to Vietnam my employer said it would be really helpful if I could bring a laptop with me.  I was worried - ‘what if it gets broken’ or ‘what if it gets stolen’ I thought.  Now I am here I am so happy I brought it with me.  It helps me professionally to do my job well, and it helps me personally as I can communicate with friends, family and colleagues all over the world.\n\nDid you know that when I was in my twenties computers and the internet did not even exist?  I would never have imagined that thirty years later this gadget ‘a laptop’ has become so important to me.  I wonder what gadgets will be invented in the next thirty years!"

    "Answer": "Everything has its own importance based on necessity or frequent usage. I also have a laptop of my own and I had bought with my expenses when I was a student. The laptop has been serving me for three consecutive years. And I hope it will last long.  \n\nI bought the laptop in 2014. But it was hard for me to manage the entire amount for the laptop. Hence, I had to save money from my regular expense. Life in Australia is tough if you do not have the minimum support from your family. In fact, I had to go against my family and started earning to support my own expenses including the educational costs in Australia. I felt the necessity for a laptop and it was impossible to seek financial help from my family. So, I arranged to purchase the Dell XPS 13 Ultrabook for me. This is a great machine so far.\n\nThis is a very speedy laptop and I am greatly happy with its performance. I can do a good number of tasks with this laptop. It comes with a Core 15 processor and has 128GB SSD. The integrated graphics of this device is also very effective for me. The laptop has an 8GB RAM. On the other side, the majority of the laptops of that age had only 4GB RAM. As a result, this is a very fast laptop I have ever used. But the most important thing to me was the completion of the basic necessary tasks for me. I need to prepare presentations on the laptop and present them before the class. Besides, completing the assignments with the word processor was the other important task I had to do. I enjoyed watching movies on this laptop. I was happy with the 1080p touch display. In fact, it was a new experience to me.\n\nI had to remain very cautious about the use of this machine. The price was comparatively more than my budget and I had to cut many of my costs to afford the laptop. So, it was not possible for me to use the laptop randomly. I only used it when I needed it most. In a day, I used it for three to four hours. And by this time, I completed all of my necessary tasks. I had some other mates and friends in the university. They also had laptops but the way they used was different than me. They took almost no care for their devices and hence the laptops suffered different damages. Besides, some of them kept the machine open for hours. In fact, they did not switch off the laptops even in a week. As a result, they did not get the optimum performance from the laptop. But my experience is the opposite. I am having a better performance even after passing a notable moment with the laptop.\n\nThe laptop is important to me for various reasons. First of all, I needed it badly to complete my presentations at the university class. Besides, completing the assignments was the other important reason to have the laptop. This is not the age to submit assignments by hand writing. Often I had to download e-books for my academic studies and communicate with my university professors using e-mail. I was not addicted to social networking and still, I do escape from the time killing activities. But my academic and other needs were essential to me and thus the laptop is important."

    "Answer": "Thank you for giving me the chance to talk about this topic. Actually, I can remember quite a few occasions when I tried to lend a helping hand to others. The particular event that I would like to talk about was the time when I helped a poor family in our hometown during my college years.\n\nI can’t recall the exact name of the person but I remember that he had a family of 5 members and he was a technician. He had very little education and he mostly relied on the small shop he had to repair electronic goods. After a devastating cyclone, his small shop was demolished and he had no other income source or ability to rebuild it. One day I noticed him trying to console his small kids who were demanding for foods. This happened near our college campus and I had been there to meet a friend. I was so touched by the beautiful yet gloomy faced kids that I went ahead and talk to this person. He explained what happened and was talking in a trembling voice. He also told me he assured her wife that he would feed the kids and would bring foods to home.\n\nI bought them some snacks and fruits and asked them to stay nearby for a while. I watched the small kids were eating the foods voraciously and they had smiles on their face. I went to my class and told the whole story to my three close friends. Finally, we went to our class teacher and wrote an application regarding the suffering of the person and his family. The teacher permitted us to spend an hour to raise some money for the suffering family from other classes and we were so glad to have the permission.\nWe had been able to convey the sufferings of this person and his family to the students and teachers and we raised a significant amount of money which was beyond my expectation. With this money we bought some foods and clothes for this family and they were so grateful that the husband and wife started crying and praying for us. We gave the man the remaining amount and he had been able to start his work again.\n\nAbout my feelings, I was very satisfied and contended. This is the first time I realised how enthralling and satisfying it is to help someone. I felt like blessed and the person and his wife revered me as if I was their dear one. In fact being able to help someone in need is something we can only feel and words can’t actually describe it."

    "Answer": "Helping others is really a very good habit. But sometimes, you will need to be careful about providing the support. In my life, I have helped many people and at the same time, I was punished for helping them. In fact, almost all the events were bitter for me, and now I will describe the latest event that took place with me.\n\nBeing a student and part-time worker in Malaysia, life is difficult to me. I have been struggling with my challenges but try to help others in all possible forms. A university friend of mine, Christopher (I am not citing his real name) wanted some monetary supports for me to deposit his tuition fees for the new semester. In fact, he did not work and studies with the expense of his own, rather he depends on his family. He belongs to a wealthy family from Kenya and it was for the first time that he sought financial help to me.\n\nBut the situation was difficult for me to handle. In fact, Christopher and I were in the same department and lived in the same dormitory. When he asked for the support, I was perplexed. I also had to deposit my tuition fees. So, I had only the portion of mine and was unable to provide any support to him. Later, I had an idea that why should not I share my amount with him. It will help to meet the crises. So I shared my tuition fees with him and gave him the half of the amount. We had the option to pay the fees by three instalments. Usually, I used to pay the entire amount at the beginning of the semester but now I took the option to use the instalment facilities. Accordingly, I lend him from my money to pay the first instalment of the semester with me.\n\nChristopher successfully deposited the first instalment and then he also deposited the due amount when he received his required fund from his family. Both of us completed the semester successfully and now we are waiting for the next semester to begin. But it was hard for me to adjust the amount in the later instalments. Though my family is solvent enough to bear my educational expense, I do not take any support from them for this purpose. Rather, I am trying to uphold myself with my own efforts. Hence, I am trying to be self-reliant from my student life. However, I had a splendid performance in that semester despite the trouble of arranging the remaining tuition fee amount and some other unwanted hazards.\n\nFinally, I felt pity for Christopher as he did not pay me back the amount I shared with him. In fact, he cheated on me with the money. He refused about the issue and clearly forbid me not to disturb him about the issue anymore. I do not know why he behaved so badly about the monetary issue. If he did not want to pay me the money, he could have told me in person. But he did not do so and created for some scenes in conjunction of some of his friends. I deeply felt sorry for helping a boy like him. Later, I came to know that he became a drug addict and spent the money on buying drug which he was supposed to return me. It was an unwanted experience indeed."

    "Answer": "Mr. Jonathon Lee is a very famous teacher whom I know personally. He was our Math teacher in our college and he is still teaching Mathematics in a famous college in our country.\n\nHe was a tall man with an athletic built and his complexion was very fair. He had a strong feature in his look and had an amiable yet strong personality. He was very careless about his dresses and used powerful eyeglasses.\n\nHe is a polite person when you are polite with him. If you behave roughly, he won’t tolerate. He was such a person. I have never seen him lose his composure and patience to a nice person. He had a very good way to teach and we liked him very much for his excellent teaching style. He was a fan of Football and we often saw him playing football in the morning.\n\nI liked him because he was a reliable person and a good mentor. I often struggled to understand the Linear Algebra and Geometry. He spent a great deal of time to explain the intricacies of these questions and amazingly I scored very high in my final term in Mathematics. I also learned how to be a good chess player from him.\n\nYou can understand such a good person would naturally be revered and loved by the students and their parents. And I can’t remember a single student who did not like him. Because of his strong personality, amiable behaviour, excellent teaching style and extracurricular activities he became a famous teacher in our hometown. However, after I left college I heard that he was writing a book on Mathematics. After few years I have seen his picture in the newspaper as he was nominated as the ‘Best Teacher of the year’ in our State."

    "Answer": "I am lucky to have the chance of completing my graduation from the University of Bristol in the UK. Here I have met with a big number of people and teachers whom I admire most in my life. Ms Samantha Robert is one of the teachers who popular among her students.\n\nShe is an admiring lady with a good number of qualities. She is in her forties but she looks pretty with this middle age. She wears small frame-less glasses and her face turns a beautiful look with them. She is very decent in her attires and loves to put a flower on her hair. It makes her look charming. I have seen some other lady teachers but a majority of them did not have any personality as Ms Robert owns. In fact, many of her students and teachers are in love with her stunning personality. She is neither reserved nor chatty. She does not talk except her necessities. But she can make a lot of fun indeed.\n\nDespite being some reserved, Ms Robert loves to socialise with people, especially with her students. She cares for each of the students and help or provides the necessary supports in their needs. But she owns some negative qualities as well. She is short tempered and when she is angry, she loses self-control. Luckily, she turns angry once or twice annually and it is the students who are responsible for agitating her. She is extremely sincere about the academic activities. She offers chances to her students to amend them and once her patience is over, she becomes too angry to control. So, everyone tries to do their best not to make her angry. On the other side, she is also a humanitarian and loves to help everyone in their need. Whenever I went to meet her at her chamber, she never refused to provide the necessary support to me. I was lucky in this sense that I never experienced her anger during my entire graduation.    \n\nWhen I was in my first semester, I had to struggle with economics. I was unable to understand the complex economic theories. As a result, I could not cut a good figure in the first-semester exam. Only for economics, my overall grade was reduced to a great extent. In the beginning of the second semester, Ms Robert came to take our class on the same course but the range of the course this time was larger. I told her about my failure of not understanding some of the theories and she instantly described the theories. It appeared that the ambiguities on the theories were gone in seconds. In fact, it was the very first interaction of mine with her. Gradually, I went to her to know about many other issues related to the course and she always cooperated me. She used some real-life examples to make the things clearer.\n\nDespite her ‘serious’ anger, Ms Robert is popular among her students and teachers and overall in the university. I think her anger is a pretention to make the things done by her students. When someone approaches her for any types of support, she has not learnt to refuse. She is really a good-natured woman. When she finds anyone inattentive in the class, she does not show anger rather comes with sympathy to solve the issues with the student. Furthermore, she invites her students to her home if she cannot take part in the class for any other unintentional business. Such things have made her popular in the university and still, I miss her class though I have left the university last month."

    "Answer": "Chinatown in Singapore is one of the most interesting places I have ever visited as a tourist. I have never been to China but Singapore’s Chinatown gave me a pretty good idea about this unseen country.\n\nChinatown is located within the larger district of Outram and the name was given by the British and is still used by the people. This place features the distinctive ethnic and cultural Chinese and it historically concentrates ethnical Chinese population.\n\nI went to Singapore as a tourist and visiting Chinatown was scheduled by our travel company. It was probably early December 2012 when we visited the Chinatown.\nAs a tourist I explored as much area as possible of this region, I ate authentic Chinese foods, I visited Chinese Heritage Centre and saw the impressive and beautiful Sri Mariamman Hindu temple & Buddha Tooth Relic temple. I visited many mom-and-pop and traditional shops, bought some interesting stuff and talked to some local shop owners and salespersons.\n\nThe whole area was very attractive and interesting in my taste. I felt like I was witnessing something I have never seen existed. The street architecture of building, shop houses, painted ladies and the people gave me a totally different experience. I have tasted a whole different Chinese menu that I have never eaten.  Trengganu Street, Pagoda Street and Temple Street are some examples of unique and traditional architecture that was quite fascinating.\n\nI stayed there for about 2 days and these 48 hours of time gave me a quite new and enthralling experience. I think this place was very interesting and quite distinctive in my experience."

    "Answer": "Travelling is my hobby and I annually make a travel to any attractive place. In fact, this has become a part of me in the last couple of years. I went to Australia last year and visited the Bondi Beach, one of the national heritage of the country. The experience at the place was great for me. I have some interesting experience about this popular sea beach and I am happy to describe them here.\n\nI stayed in Sydney and the beach is around seven kilometres away from the location where I stayed. The beach is named after the surrounding locality and has become popular in many senses. The sea beach is an attractive area and a good number of visitors gather here around the year to enjoy the natural beauty. Besides, there are some other recreational activities are also available in the beach area. I also took part in some of them and had derived great amusement then.  \n\nAs I said before, I have formulated a habit of travelling annually, it was as the part of my annual travel. In fact, I have a dream to travel across the world and accordingly, I am making my dream come true. I have visited in some other places like some parts of the USA and the UK. Besides, I also travelled in some other parts of Asia. But I have visited almost all the parts of Japan, my native land. Hence, it was the time to explore Australia. Being a large country, it was not possible for me to explore the entire land by this time. So, I planned to visit some of the parts of the country and will be back in the next year to explore the remaining. My visit to the sea beach was only for pure entertainment purposes.  \n\nThe beach became extremely popular after its initiation as a public picnic ground and amusement resort after the 1850s. At present, the beach is around one kilometre in length and a large number of people come enjoy the beauty of the ocean round the year. Some its parts are hazardous while the other parts are mild. So, swimmers need to be cautious while swimming on the beach. But I enjoyed the swimming on the beach and went almost every day to swim on the gentle part. The beach is also famous for some other sporting competitions and I enjoyed the district rugby league there. Surfing is fun on the wave. But I failed to float myself on the wave crown several times and then gave up surfing. In fact, surfing did not suit me like the other activities. It was the moments of the short film festival and I watched some of the special short films at the locality. Besides, sailing, beach volleyball competition etc. are the other popular activities that I took part in during my stay.\n\nBondi Beach is an interesting place for both the natives and outsiders. The beach has an exotic location with white sands. The deep blue water attracts the attention of the crowd. And a good number of them get engaged into various recreational activities. Besides, the view of sunrise and sunset are the two most enjoyable scenes from the beach. But I was able to attend only the sunsets from the beach as my hotel was a bit far from the locality. Further, the cultural events that take place on the beach are enjoyable to the last moment. So, I think this is an interesting place to visit in Australia."

This is a documentary type TV show which is hosted by Lisa Ling and in it, explorers all around the world visit locations with unique events and fascinating news stories. This TV show is funded by National Geographic Society and done in the style of National Geographic \n\nThis is a weekly TV series of short documentary and gives a great chance to learn about the explorer and their fascinating journey around the world. Nowadays a news-style journal format is used instead of the more traditional format of the specials than the past.The host investigates a very interesting topic and thought-provoking real events and then explains the details of it.

    "Answer": "Some of the television programmes are highly addictive. I never miss the chances to enjoy such shows. How I Met Your Mother is one of such shows that attracted my attention. And I did not miss a single episode of this programme. In fact, it was one of the greatest shows that I enjoyed to the fullest extent.   \n\nHow I met Your Mother, better known as HIMYM is a comedy. This is a sitcom and the series has been ended in 2014. The series was aired on CBS and it started in 2005. It shows the future days in the present where a dad narrates the events of his life in flashbacks. The stories are interesting and able to hold attention from the audiences’ part. Further, the series was inspired from some of the real-life events. The background of the series is set in Manhattan. The series had 208 episodes altogether and luckily I have watched all of them.    \n\nThe series is mostly popular for its unique structure and narrative technique. Besides, it also contains some humour as well. The television show exhibits the life events and adventures of Ted Mosby. He narrates the events how he met with the mother of his children whom he is telling the stories. The events begin with flashbacks. It was 2005. Ted was 27 and lived in New York and he was an architect. He describes how his life changed after socialising with some of his friends. Gradually, the lives of the characters (Ted and his friends) were twined and the relationships turned complicated. Gradually, Ted describes the events of meeting with their mother. The show also depicts jokes and humour. It also shows how Ted was unwilling to discuss some specific issues with his children but describes his dates with his girlfriend amid huge censorship on the events. Despite being a love story, Ted feels uncomfortable to reveal all the events before his kids. Rather he points out the former relations more.\n\nI enjoy watching this programme because this is made with some superior events that can please the senses. The majority of the programmes are made for commercial purposes and thus they do not contain any senses of humour. Rather they are filled with the praise of specific commercial products or other things. In fact, at the end of the day when I switch the television on, I do not want to watch any commercial programmes. Rather I would prefer something that will entertain me to the fullest extent. I will look for the shows that will make me relaxed at the end of the day. So, I used to watch this show and it had all the necessary elements that made me entertained. The plot, its narrative, casts and their performance everything was up to the standard. By the same time, the direction of the series was also impressive. All the shots were taken perfectly.  \n\nI would recommend this television programme to other people because this is a really interesting show. If they start watching the very first episode, I am sure they will not give up until they have watched the last part. Besides, this is the only television show that has gained mixed reviews and positive reviews are more in number. It has also won nine Emmy Awards in different categories as a comedy show. Hence, this is a must watch for people who did not watch it before."

    "Answer": "My sister is my idol and she is the person who helped me to become the better me. She was only 3 years senior to me and yet she was the mother, mentor and best buddy to me. I am quite unlucky that I lost her 5 years ago when she died in a car accident and that was the most devastating moment in my life. She will be my guide and inspiration for the rest of my life though she is not around.\n\nI knew her my whole life. I still miss her in every passing second. I wish I could turn back to the past and meet her once again. My mother was a doctor and her profession demanded her to work long hours. My father worked in a foreign multinational company and stayed more than 7 months away from home in a typical year. To me, my sister was the world I knew. She taught me how to walk, how to read, how to swim, how to behave and even how to cherish life. I will never find a friend and counsellor like her and that’s why she had and still has the most important influence in my life.\n\nI remember an event when I was late to return home as I was playing with my friends in a nearby park and all of a sudden a ferocious storm started. I was shocked and numbed and then I noticed my sister was running fast towards the park in this devastating weather to save me. She indeed saved me many times: sometimes from a storm, sometimes from a depressive and gloomy experience and sometimes from my own evil side. Thus her influence was most significant in my life.\n\nI feel so brokenhearted not to have her near me. I would have been a much happier person if she was still alive. I wish I could be as strong she was in my tough days.  I always pray to the Almighty so that she rests in peace and we can meet again someday."

    "Answer": "I do firmly believe that human life influenced in different forms. A substantial number of things have their influence on life. In some points, there are some people who cast the best influence in life as I have experienced in mine. Mr Steve Tamplin is that source of influence whom I adore and been following for long. I will describe the event here.\n\nI know Mr Tamplin for about 15 years since I was in my high school. He was the teacher of mathematics in the school. But he preferred to be a mentor of his students than being merely a math teacher. He asked us to follow some strict rules and be disciplined in life to prosper in future. But many of the used to neglect his advice and managed their own way of living. On the contrary, I followed many of his teachings and experienced the benefits in my real-life.  \n\nI opted him for many reasons. He was the most admiring man in the school. He also was filled with human qualities and never missed his commitments to anyone whatever he did. By the same time, he was a smart man with a special analytical ability. Life was not an adventure to him. Rather he took life seriously and lead it in the manner it was supposed to be. He loved to spread his philosophy among his surrounding and all of them were helpful to lead a peaceful and prosperous life. On the other side, he had some other qualities like he loved helping people in distress and it was a completely selfless effort. He also preferred not to be publicised against his humanitarian activities. Therefore, considering the aspects, I took him as an ideal for my life. In fact, he was able to inject his ideas and philosophies in my mind.\n\nI try to follow almost all the rules and directive he had taught me in my school days. I love to live peacefully and of course in a quiet manner. I hate making troubles with the people even if they do want to trap me in troubles. Further, I appreciate everyone for their good deeds. I learnt it from Mr Tamplin to appreciate people in all stages. Besides, I have become proactive in nature. Expression of reaction for anything is against my nature now which also is the result of the following advice from him. Whenever I start a conversation with people, I try to be an attentive listener. As a result, they like me more. In fact, this is a great technique to be preferred by people and Mr Tamplin was my mentor is this aspect. Now, it appears that a notable portion and activities of my life are influenced by him greatly.    \n\nI feel a sense of great respect for him. I have left him about 15 years ago but still, I have a link with him. He is like a fatherly figure to me with all of his directives for my wellbeing. He is the man who does not want any appreciation for his works and been relentlessly working for the good of his students, and in other terms for mankind. He is in the heart of all of his students for his benevolent nature and lovely attitudes. Mr Tamplin is the person who has influenced a lot of lives. He is the teacher who knows how to enlighten and influence a human mind. And he is doing that successfully for a long time."

However, there are some occasions when I prefer meeting people at a restaurant and like to taste the delicious menus the restaurants offer. One such restaurant is ‘Plaza de Capita Foods’ that I really like and I would like to thank you for the opportunity to talk about my favourite restaurant that I enjoyed going to.\n\nI went to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago with my parents and siblings. The restaurant is situated in a large shopping mall in the city we live in and it is almost 30 minutes away from our home. The restaurant is on the 18th floor and offers a nice open sky view.\n\nIt was my younger sister’s birthday and we planned prior to the occasion to celebrate this special day outside. As part of our whole day plan, we ate the dinner at this restaurant. My father also like the way the restaurant offers an excellent dining experience at a moderately cheaper price.\n\nWe ate the buffet and that included almost 40 items in total. I remember eating around 8-9 items while my parents less. But my younger brother John enjoyed more than 20 items. Side note: He did not eat all the items. He just tasted many of them!\n\nThe common items we ate included fried rice, sandwiches, fried chicken, curry chicken, cheese and onion rolls, seafood platter, garlic bread, prawns and ice cream. The restaurant offers an excellent view as well as a nice decoration. It was a perfect place to enjoy our dinner and they offered a free birthday cake! I loved the way they served the foods and the overall price was reasonable. It was my younger sister’s birthday and the dinner could not have been better!"

    "Answer": "I am not a foodie but I do not miss the chances of having some delicious meals when I am in travel. In January last, I went to Yangon for some business purposes and had my meals at a restaurant named Le Planteur, a gorgeous restaurant. It was a nice experience for me.\n\nThis is a posh restaurant. Le Planteur is located at the University Avenue under Bahan Township in Yangon. This is a large fine restaurant in the city and comes with a great number of delicious food menus. Besides, the representation of the foods was another impressive aspect of this restaurant. Pricing is comparatively reasonable than the other contemporary restaurants in the city. It is accessible by all available means as it is located in the city centre. I took my lunch and supper in the restaurant during my stay in Yangon and I am highly glad about their service.    \n\nI am a sales manager for a multinational computer hardware manufacturer and I work mostly in Malaysia. The authority has opened a new branch in Yangon and I was sent from Malaysia to diagnose a test about the success rate of our products. So, it was a business trip for me. But I was also accompanied by some other colleagues of mine from a different department. In fact, we were seven in number altogether. The regional manager was with us in line with the other managers. Actually, the managers of various departments, including me, participated in the tour. The accommodation was good but the foods were great. I have a habit of homework before moving to a new place. I try to learn about the best living arrangements, foods, convenient routs and other issues. Accordingly, I was asked to sort out a standard restaurant for dining purposes.\n\nThe restaurant offered a wide number of courses including lobsters, fish menus, desserts and more others. But I liked the traditional meal of Yangon most than any other things in the restaurants. Besides, I loved the dessert prepared with some local ingredient. On the other side, my other companions took some of the foreign dishes available in the restaurant. The bistro menu was the top quality dish that they highly praised. The restaurant also had the opportunity to take candle light dinner in a romantic environment which was really appealing to us all. We wanted to have a candle light dinner but discarded the idea because that was unsuitable for us. Instead of such ideas, we concentrated on having the best quality meals in the restaurant and really enjoyed our foods.  \n\nThis was a very good restaurant for many aspects. Firstly, it is located at a convenient location. The restaurant is accessible from any parts of the city. This is splendid restaurant considering the foods it offers to the visitors. There are a large collection of foods and you can have it based on your taste. Pricing is not an issue here. In fact, the food prices are far cheaper than the other restaurants while the service belongs to the top class. I also loved the interior decoration and seating arrangements. The restaurant authority is highly efficient and serves the foods shortly after ordered. So, I was in love with the restaurant and took all of my meals excluding the breakfast in that place."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much to let me talk about this cue card topic. The story that I am going to talk about is a fascinating story on how an eight year’s old kid saved more than 500 people from possible fatal casualty. I read this story a year ago in a daily newspaper.\n\nThis story was published in a popular newspaper that I used to read every day at that time and it was featured as a story of bravery and exemplary one.\n\nAn eight years old boy was playing with some other kids in the evening near a rail junction and suddenly noticed that a part of the rail track was severely damaged. While other kids ignored that and returned to their houses, this particular boy was different and he went home and persuaded his father that something bad is going to happen. He came back to the train junction with his father and took a great deal of hassle to convince the rail officers to actually go to visit the damage. They officers were reluctant to do so and thought it was a child’s imagination or lack of comprehension. But the boy was adamant and with his father, they were able to finally convince them that something terrible might happen if they do not take prompt actions. When all of them saw the severe damage on the rail track, it was almost the time for a passenger rail to pass this junction using this particular rail track. It was evening and very few people were in the station. The railway authority understood that repairing the harmed railroad was impossible. They immediately informed the nearby station and warned them so that the train does not leave that junction.\n\nNext day many rail supervisors and employees visited the place and they were amazed by the bravery the boy showed to save people from an approaching peril.  \nI followed the news story and next day it made the headline of every local newspaper. As far I remember the boy was given many gifts by the rail authorities as well as the local administration.\n\nThe story was an exemplary one to remind us how a small sacrifice and bravery can save others. The eight years old boy showed his utmost intelligence, heroism and prompt actions to save people from unforeseeable dangers. The event was so touchy that it went viral in a day and that hit the headline of many newspapers. I did not watch TV that time, but I am sure that was also in TV news.\n\nFrom the very nature of this event, we can understand that we revere the good news and we are not used to the bad news only. The great courage of a small kid saved the lives of many and that was an indeed worth news story to let the people of the whole country know and feel proud of."

    "Answer": "A very recent story has shocked the world, I think, and this is the unwanted event of catching fire to an iPhone 7 plus. In fact, this was a heartbreaking news for the iPhone lovers across the world and this is for the first time that the brand has experienced such an undesired situation.\n\nWhile reading a newspaper, I came to know about the news. I was reading the newspaper yesterday like the other days and then suddenly a news on the Technology page attracted my attention. Usually, I read the newspaper early hours in the morning before moving to my office, and I came to know about the event then. Since I am tech-lover, I do not miss any updates about technological advancements. As part of gathering the updates, I take a careful look at the page. Accordingly, I came to know about the story that appears interesting to me.  \n\nThe story was about the demerits of lithium-ion batteries and how it catches fire. The report read that earlier the events of fire happened with the device of Samsung and now it is happening with the devices of tech-giant Apple Inc. It was the very first event with the Apple devices. At present, Apple devices are the symbol of status. Having an iPhone or Apple device increase the social status a lot. But everything has its demerits. The latest iPhone had caught fire and got completely damaged while it was in charge. The girl, who own that phone, immediately recorded video of the event and spread that on Twitter. The video went viral immediately after it was on the social networking platform. Later, the Apple Inc. authority had made contact with her and replaced the damaged phone. The authority also assured her to look into the matter deeply.   \n\nI think the story was in the news for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it was an accident which can result in more detrimental impacts. The girl has been saved as she was away from the charging phone. If she was near the phone while it caught fire, she could have been injured to some extent. This is a precautionary measure for everyone. People having such smartphones should be careful while charging them. On the other side, this is also a warning for the smartphone manufacturers. Previously, Samsung had to stop one of its smartphone production last year as that had defects with the battery. The similar types of batteries have been included with the latest model of iPhone. Hence, the manufacturer should be careful about the issue lest they also have to be defeated in the competition.   \n\nThis appeared an interesting news story to me. The video shows how the phone caught fire and making a weird noise. The girl was smart and brave enough to record video of the event. If there were someone else, definitely it would have been hard to handle the situation so smoothly. By the same time, she has ensured another iPhone 7 plus from the Apple Inc. authority and also confirmed their assurance so that the other users do not fall in such troubles. In fact, I was planning to purchase an iPhone 7 plus after a few days. But I changed my mind and planning to get something different. It has become perilous to buy iPhone 7 plus for the risks of catching fire on the phone."

    "Answer": "My recent business trip to Nepal has provided me with some special sort of experience regarding shopping in the country. There are some large shopping centres available in the capital city Kathmandu. So, I visited one of the largest one and now will describe the experience in brief.\n\nI went at the Times Square Mall. This is one of the largest shopping centres in the capital city. The mall is located in Durbar Marg and the place is also considered as the heart of Kathmandu city. The mall is a four-storied building and comes with a good number of products and services. Actually, Kathmandu is a historical city and contains a substantial number of tourist spots. But the shopping malls in the city are no less attractive than the tourist spots. This specific shopping centre is located in the centre of the city and thus accessible to everyone. I went to the mall as I found it crowded than the other shopping malls. To meet my curiosity, I went there and had my shopping done.   \n\nNepal is not a very large country and its capital is also a smaller than I expected it should be. But it comes with all the modern amenities. Accordingly, the number of public transport is moderate. The majority of the people use the public transports while the rich have their own private means of transports. When it is about shopping, most of the people prefer to ride on the public buses or other forms of transports. They usually try to avoid the private transportation while shopping in the shopping centres for some reasons. Car parking facilities are not improved here and it is troublesome to park the car before the entrance of the shopping malls. Besides, most of the shopping centres are located in the heart of the city and thus accessible by all types of public transports. But I used my feet to reach the shopping centre as it was in a short distance from my hotel I stayed during the visit.  \n\nThere are around 30 shops and stores in this shopping centre which sell almost all types of products and services to its clients. It contains separate stores for men women and children. The entire building is dedicated to shopping while the rooftop part is covered with food courts where the visitors and shoppers will have the chance to taste the traditional and international delicious foods and items. The shopping centre is famous for selling jeans and other attires. Some of the international brands have their own outlets in this centre. Besides, it comes with makeover saloon for male and female. The products and services are the latest and affordable in terms of price and quality. The return policy of the sellers is also adorable. They will return the sold well if there are any defects found after the sales. This is a great place for shoppers including the young and middle-aged people.  \n\nYes, this is a very good place for shopping in Kathmandu. If you want to have a clean and preferable atmosphere, you can visit this shopping centre. This place is located at a convenient location. Besides, the prices of the products are reasonable. You will not need to bargain with the sellers. Another interesting aspect of the shopping mall is that it remains open round the year. The shops open at 11 am and you can continue shopping till its closure at 10 pm. The rooftop food courts is an excellent place to enjoy foods and live music. Based on all such aspects, this is a preferable place for shopping to me."

    "Answer": "I went to visit Germany two years ago and stayed at Stuttgart for a couple of days. The Gerber shopping mall caught my eyes with its excellent design and next evening I went for shopping there with two of my friends. This shopping mall was located near the Stadtmitte and it had more than 100 shops and restaurants.  \n\nPeople reach this shopping mall using their private cars, local buses and many people who lived nearby went there on foot. I was living nearby and that’s why I went to this shopping mall on foot.\n\nThere were many shops to visit and the store concept of the mall was very lofty. It has different renowned brands with rich shopping items. Among renowned brands, it had H&M, ELB, Brandy Melville, Urban Outfitters, Vans, Kayak etc.\n\nAfter our 3-4 ours stay there, we bought few items including t-shirts, Jeans pant, coffee and a pair of shoes. I liked the admirable design concept of the shops and I really enjoyed my shopping there. The prices were moderate and the environment was very clean and it gave us a light open airy feeling. I noticed security personnel quite often and that was assuring to have a good shopping experience there. There was a grocery shop where I noticed a lot of people were shopping. My experience in this shopping mall was quite pleasant and that’s why I would say that the Gerber shopping mall would an excellent choice for shopping."

    "Answer": "When it is June, the inhabitants of Sydney start their preparation to enjoy the Sydney Film Festival. This is an annual film festival in the city that has drawn attention from almost every quarters. It takes places in different parts of the city and I never miss to participate here.  \n\nThe event begins in the very first week of June every year and it lasts for over 12 days. This is a competitive film festival where a good number of movie makers take part with their creations. Various types of movies are exhibited in this festival. The history of this film festival dates back to a long ago – 1954 but it collected inspiration to hold such an event more before and has reached in the current shape after lots of experiments and ups and downs. This is a festival that is opened for all and exhibits all types of films, documentaries or animated films. Though it takes place in June, many of its spectators wait for the event round the year.     \n\nSydney film festival is an annual event in Australia and it takes place for some reasons. Firstly, it is a platform to exhibit the creations of the local film makers. In fact, this a kind of opportunity for them to justify their demands on the market. Besides, they also can have some idea how their movies will be satisfying or gather criticisms. This is a great initiative to amend their ideas and film making techniques. Further, the film festival exhibits almost every type of films in different parts of the city. So, the audiences get the chance to enjoy the film which they want. It has also created a platform for the newbies in the film making industry. They have the chances to practice their film making skills and expertise before moving to a large project. By making short films, they are gathering experience and by the same time, fame. This is a great benefit for the film makers and producers indeed.  \n\nHere, most of the people come to enjoy the movies while there are some critiques as well who talk about different aspects of the movies that have been exhibited. A festival is a great event for the kids. They love enjoying the animated movies more than any other thing in the festival. Besides, the majority of the audiences love to enjoy the short films. Actually, the short films have a different attraction to the audiences as they last less long than the other movie formats. As a result, they pass some effective moments. Some of the audiences come with their families and pass some quality times with the family members. So, this is a great thing for all of them.   \n\nThis is a very special event in Sydney for some specific reasons. This has become a platform for new and experienced film makers. The newbies become expert in making various types of films while the experts gather public opinions on their projects. This is a testing field for them. On the other side, the ordinary audiences get a unique opportunity to enjoy some of the finest pieces through the festival. Being a competitive festival, all of the film makers try to make the best movie that they can within their limit. As a result, the movies get local and international attention and this is a great advantage for them. Considering all the aspects, the festival has become a very special one."

    "Answer": "I am going to tell you about a website that I visit frequently. I will tell you the name of the website, how long I’ve been using it, something about the content of the website and I’ll try to explain why it is I keep going back to look at it. The website is called 'workaway' and the URL of this website is www.workaway.info\n\nI haven’t been using the website for all that long. I think I found it just by accident, about three years ago, but once I knew it existed I started looking at it more and more. The website is really just a portal, which puts potential ‘hosts’ from all around the world, in touch with potential ‘volunteers’ who might also live anywhere across the globe. On their website, they say that they exist to promote fair exchange between budget travellers, language learners or culture seekers and families, individuals or organisations who are looking for help with a range of varied and interesting activities, and indeed that is what they do. The basic principle is that ‘hosts’ are organisations or people who need help with some task, they will provide food, accommodation and cultural exchange in return for up to five hours work a day from a willing ‘volunteer’. The ’work’ might be helping with animals, tourists, gardening, language learning or anything else, and the opportunities are in every country imaginable. I have sought opportunities to teach English in Thailand; work with Camels in the desert and help at seaside Bed & Breakfast establishments in Brighton England.  \n\n‘Hosts’ put up a profile introducing themselves and explaining what help they need and what sort of accommodation they offer in exchange.  Sometimes it is quite impressive – your own en-suite room in a hotel, other times it might be just a patch of land on which to pitch a tent whilst helping establish a new yoga eco-community!  There really does seem to be something for everyone.  People who have already volunteered with a particular host will sometimes leave reviews to say what it was like working and living there.  Usually, a host will also put up some photos so you can see the location and understand a bit more about the people you might be living and working with.\n\nIf you are interested in volunteering you can look at all the opportunities without registering on the site.  However, if you actually want to contact a host and ask about volunteering then you have to register and set up your own profile outlining your skills, experience and travel plans.  It only costs about 20 Euros for two years membership of the site, so I think that’s good value.You have to be a little careful as some of the ‘opportunities’ seem like they might just be hosts looking for free labour, but then again, if you want to travel and you don’t mind hard work then it could be worth it for a couple of weeks to get to visit somewhere you would otherwise never be able to go!\n\nI visit the website quite often because I like to imagine all the endless possibilities for travel and adventure that I might do one day!  I actually got a job through the website, teaching English in Vietnam and it was a great adventure.  Now I have ongoing wanderlust, and I like to keep plotting for my next trip!  Workaway keeps that dream alive."

    "Answer": "The Internet is one of the most productive wonders of sciences and websites are considered as the life of the internet. Almost all of the people are to browse or visit numerous websites every day for their respective needs. I also like to browse websites and like quora.com as the best one.  \n\nThis is the website that comes with lots of questions and answers. In fact, the website is made to ask questions and answer them by the website users. Sometimes the answers are funny like the questions while most of the times the answers are effective enough to solve any problems. The website is based in California and started the journey from 2010. The website was founded in 2009 but it came into full-fledged operation from the consecutive year. The users are allowed to edit their questions and answers. Privacy is not a concerning issue here but the users are to register with their real names.  \n\nI have been using the website for past two years. In fact, I had no idea before using the website that such a website is available on the internet where I will get some proper solutions to my problems. I was in a rush to complete one my chemistry projects when I was at the college in Somalia. One of my teachers from the college suggested me to get ideas from the internet. He also suggested about this website. I was instructed to post my problem on the website. It was really a great help to me. I received a substantial number of solutions about the chemistry project within a short time after posting my problem on the website. The users of the website came into my help and suggested me about the potential solutions. Actually, the people who came for my help also had the similar problem in their academic life and it was interesting indeed. Since then, the website has become a partner for me.    \n\nThe website is entirely about asking questions and answer. Though the idea is not completely a unique one, it is effective in many aspects. Google.com is a prominent website but does not provide any direct solution to problems. Someone needs to type keywords which direct them to any specific website that may contain the answer. If the answer is not found, they need to change the keywords or seek into another website for potential answers. But the system is different here. The users need to register and ask their questions. They will get the answers from the users of this website within a short time of placing the question. Besides, the answers are realistic and there are fewer chances of being cheated or wasting times after the solutions. This is really a very good website that contains numerous questions and answers which are highly helpful in real-life situations.  \n\nI frequently visit the website for many reasons. Firstly, I love to read the questions and answers placed on the website. The solutions are often unique and interesting. They are like fascinating stories that attract attention and ignite a sense of helping others. So, I always try to connect with the stories. Besides, the questions and answers also broaden my outlook. Sometimes, I try to answer some of the questions based on my experience and often the answers work well. Helping others provide me with a great pleasure indeed. So, I visit the website regularly."

    "Answer": "So, today I’m going to talk about a book that has had a major influence on me. I will first tell you the name of the book, then I’ll tell you how I heard about it. Next, I’ll outline the main story and finally I will explain why it plays an important role in my life.\n\nThe book is called ‘Tracks’, and it is by an Australian woman called Robyn Davidson. It’s quite old now, I think it was written in about 1980, but it has recently been made into a film, so perhaps you will have heard of it.\n\nI was introduced to the book by an Australian friend.  She was travelling in England when I met her, and we were both working at the same place. I said how brave she was going round the world, and how much I’d like to do it but I didn’t have the skills and courage to do the same.  She insisted that bravery doesn’t really come into it, sometimes you just have to go. When she left to continue on her travels she gave me a copy of this book, with an inscription that was taken from its last chapter which basically says, the hardest part of any endeavour (or journey) is taking the first step, making the decision to go, and after that it’s easy!\n\nThe book is a true account of a young woman who decides to cross the Great Australian Desert on her own by camel! That is some 1700 miles of Australian outback, from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean.  What I found remarkable about the tale, is that the woman who does this is herself not that well equipped.  She makes lots of mistakes, things go wrong, she loses confidence at times, and it is by no means easy.  At the start of the journey she’d never met a camel, let alone knew about how to work with them!  However, she overcame all these obstacles through tenacity and creativity and achieved her goal.  It was precisely because she was apparently so unsuited to the endeavour that I found it really inspirational to read.  Sometimes you read tales of adventurers and the people who do great thing seem to be super-human, incredibly resourceful, strong or wealthy and you end up thinking ‘that’s amazing, but I could never do that’. With Robyn’s tale, it is different. You think ‘well if she can I could too.  It won’t be easy, but it isn’t necessarily impossible either’.\n\nSo why is the book so important to me?  Because it gave me a nudge to do something I’d been wanting to do for a very long time.  To travel.  The story inspired me, but also the confidence that my friend had in me that I could do it too helped me to eventually take the decision to go off exploring the world.  Perhaps not anything quite so remarkable as crossing a desert on my own apart from a few camels, but my own adventures nevertheless.  Since then I’ve found out for myself that it is indeed true, the hardest bit about any adventure is making the decision to take the first step.  I wouldn’t say that after that it is necessarily easy, but I would say if you keep going forward you won’t want to look back!"

    "Answer": "I am greatly influenced by the novel – The Alchemist. This is one of the bestsellers and I like the novel for a good many reasons. The book is about finding one’s destiny. I am extremely glad to get the opportunity on discussing the novel I like most.\n\nThe novel was composed in the Portuguese language by the Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho. It was composed in 1987 and was published in the next year. The entire book is about the firm determination which gets natural help. The novel shows how the universe helps someone in reaching the destiny. But by the same time, there should be a firm intention towards success. The novel was written within a very short time – two weeks only. The writer had completed his work so speedily that it amazes me greatly. He told about the writing speed that the plot was in his soul and thus he was able to complete it within this short time.    \n\nI love to read books of various tastes. Some of my family members term me as book worm because of my book reading nature. I first came to know about the book from an uncle (my dad’s friend) who came to our house and had some conversations with me. He told me about the book and advised me to read it. He also told me that the novel will enrich my mind from diversified perspectives. After his directives, I collected the book. But it was really difficult to get the book in the local book shops of Paris where I live in. So, I had to wait for a few days before having the book. One of the book sellers, from whom I regularly collect books, took my order and asked me to wait for somedays till he manages the book. Finally, I got the book after about one month after I placed the order.   \n\nThe novel revolves around the theme about the destiny. The core theme of the book is about the supports from the universe. When someone tries to get something by heart, the entire universe comes in to help to gain the thing. Finding the destiny becomes easier then. With this novel – The Alchemist, the author wants to prove that someone needs to be true with the determination. The story runs with the events of an Andalusian shepherd and his journey to Egypt. The young boy started for Egypt to find treasure in pyramids. He dreamt about the similar thing for a couple of times and he realised the fact that he needs to move ahead to make his dream come true. Santiago, the young shepherd, believed that he would reach his dream someday and accordingly, he made the plan to visit Egypt. In his way to the destiny, he had met with several people who inspired him to reach his goal. He falls in love and gets a new realisation about life.         \n\nThe novel had some major influences on me after I completed reading it. In fact, it may sound weird that I have started believing on personal legend and reached the goals I dreamt for. I wanted to succeed in my academic activities. It was difficult for me to obtain a very good score in the exams. But with the firm determination, I found that everything was easier to me. I got supports from my parents and classmates in the university which I never had before. My way of thinking towards the world changed and I won everything I wanted to win before. I got the idea from the novel and it was a great help for me indeed."

    "Answer": "Usually watching movies is not in my nature but if there are something special, I do not miss. Accordingly, I enjoyed a movie named – Forrest Gump. This was a 19947 movie and belonged to comedy-drama genre. I enjoyed the movie to the last minute.  \n\nForrest Gump was all about the life events of a man with the same name. He was a kind hearted man but had a dull intelligence. He was slower than the other people of his time. the movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis. The movie script had been produced by the novel of the same name and it was authored by Winston Groom. But there are some changes in the movie than the novel, and I think the changes were brought to make the movie more attractive than the novel itself. Filming for the movie began in the later part of 1993 and it was done in Georgina, South and North Carolina. It was one of the most commercially successful movies of that time after its release in 1994.\n\nI told before that I am not much interested in watching movies. Sitting motionless appears to be boring to me. So, I am not in favour of watching movies. But this one attracted my attention. I heard the story of the movie from one of my friends at a conversation. He was praising high for the movie and especially its plot. He was describing the events in such a manner that everything was happening before his eyes. His narratives were attractive and inspired me to watch the movie. Later, I searched for the movie on the internet and came to know that it was really a good one to enjoy. Accordingly, I collected the movie and watched it at my home. Initially, the movie was not that much attractive but once I entered into the movie, I started enjoying all the scenes.   \n\nThe movie basically tells about the life events of Forrest Gump, which are extraordinary in most of the cases. It starts with the childhood and gradually shows the life events of Gump. Most of the events are shown in flashbacks. The movie begins with the scene which shows Gump sitting at a bus stop and describing the events to a stranger sitting next to him. During the conversations, he remembers the childhood events and gradually described his life. He narrated about his single mother, how was admitted at the school despite his slow intellect, how he was bullied by the others, his escape, his special running skill, his scholarship at the university as a football player, his affair, his joining the army and the other events. The events depicted the moments of the 1950s and afterwards. The meeting with Lieutenant Dan in the army and their joint ventures also appeared in the conversations. The nationwide running was another important factor in the conversation. Finally, it shows that he was waiting for his son at the bus stop who went school for the first time.\n\nI was touched by the lie events of Forest Gump. He actually suffered a lot in his life. Life was filled with thrones for him. But finally, he overcame all the obstacles for his determination and kindness. He never hurt anyone with his activities rather he was attacked and humiliated by everyone in most of the cases. Further, since he had a slow wit, he was unable to take the right decision. His love to Jenny remained the same and he is engaged in taking care of the child they got together. All such issues had some emotional impacts on me which helped me to fall in love with the movie. In fact, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and enjoyed."

    "Answer": "Today I am going to talk about the job I would like to do in the future. I will tell you what the job is, what it involves and why I’d like to do it – ‘though maybe not for ever!\nThe job I would like to do in the future is that of a Flight Attendant. The job role is also sometimes known as ‘air cabin crew’ or ‘air steward’, but they all they do the same thing.\n\nThe job of a flight attendant is basically to help passengers when they are flying. If you have ever travelled by plane, perhaps you think all they do is serve food and drinks. In fact, they have an important job. They have to provide excellent customer service in cramped conditions and are also responsible for keeping all the passengers comfortable and safe. Most are trained to give first aid, and if there was to be an emergency or security risk, they are the people who would help to get everybody safely off the plane.  Many people who fly take no notice of the emergency briefing at the start of a flight, but fortunately air cabin crew practise emergency evacuation procedures so they would know what to do and be able to take charge if anything should go wrong.\n\nAlthough from the outside it can look glamorous, the work of a flight attendant is actually really hard.  For a start, you might have to work shifts and really anti-social hours.  You also have to deal with a wide range of people.  Sometimes people who are flying are nervous about their journey, and then they can be a bit bad-tempered.  Occasionally passengers will drink too much free alcohol and that can make them behave badly too, particularly as at altitude alcohol has a stronger effect. Even so, however tired you are, and however rude the passengers might be, a good flight attendant has to smile and just ‘keep calm and carry on!’\n\nThe reason I would like to do this job, even though it is hard, is because I am studying languages.  I would really like to be able to use my language skills in my job.  Working as a member of the air cabin crew I would meet people from lots of different countries, and I would be able to use my language skills.  I would particularly like to work on long-haul flights, and then I would get the opportunity to spend time in parts of the world that I could not otherwise afford to visit.  If you do a long-haul flight, you get to take your rest breaks in different countries.  I think that would be really exciting.  I also think it would be great fun to work as part of a small team of other flight attendants.  It helps that I enjoy working with customers too.  I take a pride in delivering good service in my current part-time job as a shop assistant, it gives me great job satisfaction when a customer thanks me for my help.  I expect it would be the same job satisfaction if a passenger thanked me for my help after a long or difficult flight.\n\nThe job of flight attendant is not very well paid, and working strange shifts would be difficult to do for a very long time.  So perhaps it is a job I would only do for a short while, to gain experience, and travel the world.  Later on, I might use that experience to help me get a job, perhaps as a tour manager… but that’s another story!"

    "Answer": "Everyone has a dream to be something in future and accordingly I also own such a dream. I want to be an aeronautical engineer and serve at any noted airline company after completing my graduation. In fact, this is the job that I have been dreaming for a long time.\n\nI might clear the issue here in brief. Aeronautical engineering is the branch of science that deals with the engineering aspects of air vehicles mostly. This is a subject that teaches some specific knowledge of engineering and raises skill among the students. As a result, they can be the aeronautical engineer in their profession. The profession is all about dealing with the air vehicles and their maintenance. But it is not possible for any individual who lacks knowledge on the issue. Rather this is the profession for some skilled people who own the specific knowledge about aeronautics and the aeronautical industry.   \n\nThe major responsibilities of an aeronautical engineer are wide. First of all, the engineer is responsible for maintaining the air vehicle. The position is also responsible for overall checking of a flight including the pre and after flights stages. Besides, the aeronautical engineer also plays the role of supervising any of the repairing activities of the air plane or any other air vehicle. This job is almost similar to the job of a car mechanic but there are some differences. To be a car mechanic, any individual does not need to study hard. This is a branch of science and you need to have more knowledge and skills over the issue of aeronautics. Anyone can be a troubleshooter for vehicles but it is completely opposite in the case of aeronautical engineering. The engineers are to take part in flight tests, analyse the oil pressure, maximum altitude limit for the air vehicle and more other matters at a time.  \n\nThe responsibilities of an aeronautical engineer are not limited. Rather they always need to remain busy. They become busy most before a flight takes off. I like this part of the job most for some reasons. Besides, checking the airship in technical aspects is the other interesting thing for me. The remuneration for the job is also smart and helps to lead a very decent life with family. The engineers also get some special facilities which are not available in the ordinary jobs. But there are some risks found in this job as well. An aeronautical engineer is deployed to check the overall conditions of an aircraft. If the engineer cannot figure out any trouble during his routine check, and trouble occurs during the flight on the sky, there might be some serious consequences. Hence, they need to be aware of the issues and complete their tasks in a perfect manner.         \n\nThis is a dream job for me. I have always wanted to fly like a bird and when I saw the aeroplanes in the sky, I felt something strange inside my mind. Gradually, I discovered a weakness of mine on flying and wanted to be a pilot. But later, changed my mind and decided to be an aeronautical engineer. The pilots are unaware of the mechanisms about an aeroplane while the aeronautical engineers are the people who can even make an airplane. This was the part that helped to change my mind towards aeronautical engineer. Since then, I have been dreaming of being an aeronautical engineer at any major airline company."

    "Answer": "Today I am going to talk about the job I would like to do for my future career and I am very much interested in. I will tell you what the job is, what it involves and why I’d like to do it. The career I hope to have in the future is that of an interpreter.\n\nAn interpreter is someone who is fluent in at least two languages. It is their job to help people communicate with one another, even though they do not have a common language. The interpreter converts spoken language from one language to another. To do this job well involves listening to, understanding and memorising content in the original language, then reproducing statements, questions and speeches in a different language. I think the job would be very difficult, but very interesting to do.\n\nThe reason I have chosen this job is because I think I have the skills to help me to do it well. I am studying Business English at university, and although I am not yet fluent in two languages, I think I will be by the time I graduate. My first language is Vietnamese, and my second language is English. I am also studying Japanese, but I do not think I will be good enough at that to offer it as another language for some time yet! In addition, I really enjoy meeting new people, I am interested in their opinions and ideas. \n\nReally, I am quite nosy, so I find it fascinating listening to what people have to say. I also enjoy helping people, so it would be important to me to communicate really accurately what individuals are trying to say to one another to help them work together effectively. Though this is not a mainstream and high paid job, it is nevertheless demanding. This job offers an excellent opportunity to enhance the knowledge and skill that would be helpful for the rest of the life.\n\nI am really interested in this job because it will allow me to work using my English language skills, and I love to speak English. In addition, it may give me opportunities to travel, or to work in a multi-national company where I will meet new people from all over the world, and learn about their cultures and experiences. I also think if I am good enough at my job, I will get the opportunity to develop a good career which is well paid, enjoyable and interesting.\n\nI know I will have to work very hard to achieve my goal but I think it will be worth it in the end!"

    "Answer": "People become educated to pursue their career. In fact, some of them have a dream to be something in life. I also have a dream job and I am highly interested in doing the job. It is journalism. I want to be a famous journalist in my career.\n\nJournalism is my passion for some specific reasons. This is an interesting job. The journalists have to do a large number of works and thus they bring out the truth which we read in newspapers and on other online news portals. This is a profession that serves the society directly. The journalists are always seeking the truths. When they find any disorder in the society, they figure it out and publish the issue in their respective newspapers or media. As a result, the mass people come to know about the news and can be aware of the detrimental impacts of the related matters.\n\nTo be a journalist, it is imperative to know about the journalism in prior. In fact, if someone does not have any knowledge about what journalism is, it is really tough to enter into this profession. Attending some academic course is the best way to get to know about this. Further, some real-life experience is another effective way to learn journalism. Working with any news agency may provide the scope to be aware of the pros and cons of journalism practically. So, I have planned to get enrolled in any professional course on journalism. It would have been better if I could get admitted in Media and Journalism during my graduation but unfortunately, I could not for the seats being limited in my university. I made a bit late to apply and thus I missed the chance. So, now I am seeking the chances to attend at any professional course.\n\nThis profession has a great demand in the market. In fact, this is a prestigious profession to lead a life in a decent manner. But there are some journalists who get involved in some criminal and fraudulent activities which bring a defame to the profession sometimes. That is a different perspective. And I think that only for some mean-minded people the entire profession cannot spoilt. Moreover, this is the profession that allows serving the society directly. The journalists have to collect news and views of different tests and they serve it before the public with their newspaper and other relevant media. As a result, this is a type of contribution to the society and the people consider it as a great demanding profession.     \n\nI am interested in this job for some certain reasons. First of all, I am charmed with the nature of this profession. The journalists have to move round the day to collect the news. Sometimes, they are to attend many conferences and meetings to collect information on numerous topics and natters. Then they publish the matters in the newspapers or telecast on the television channels. They have access to almost everywhere where the ordinary people have no access. They can collect information in some smart ways and make the information into news. This is a skill that they achieve after lots of practice. They can analyse the situations and get their desired information to create some special types of news that will rock the people. In a word, this is a profession that many of the youths like me dream for. So, I am interested in this job to be a journalist."

    "Answer": "If an international tourist has a one day visit to Indonesia, I would recommend him to see the island of Bali. There are various reasons why s/he should visit the island, and I will explain in details about it.\n\nFirstly, Bali is a small island, but it has many beautiful scenery places that people could visit in a day. The island is famous for its' beautiful beaches such as Kuta, Sanur and Nusa Dua Beach. These beaches are known for their beautiful white sands along their coast and for their waves as well, as tens of thousands of tourists from overseas are visiting the island annually. The location of these beaches is near therefore tourists could visit these beaches in just half a day.\n\nSecondly, as these beaches are located near to Denpasar, which is the capital city of Bali, there are many things that tourist could do in the city itself. After lying down on the beach, people could see some unique entertainments in the city, such as the traditional Barong and Kecak Dance. These traditional dances are unique and artistic because they are the combination of art, magic, philosophy and religion. And then, there are so many traditional restaurants in Bali, where tourists could try these culinary places. Bali is well known for its' pork ribs and fried chicken, and many tourists have enjoyed these culinary experiences because they are crispy and spicy.\n\nI personally believe that if an international traveller has only a day to see Indonesia, I would suggest him to visit Bali, as it has a combination of beautiful landscape, artistic traditional performance and recommended restaurants which people could visit in a day."

    "Answer": "Greece is one of the most attractive countries in the world and it contains few of the most wonderful places to visit. The places are highly interesting and probably the most desired places in entire Europe. Elafonissi beach is one of the places and I am happy to describe the beach here.\n\nGreece has many places to go to and enjoy for the visitors. Crete, the largest island in Greece, has many things to offer to its visitors and the Elafonissi beach is one of them. This is a kind of hidden treasure for the visitors. They will be unable to discover the beauty of the beach unless they visit it. The beach is an interesting place to visit and pass leisure hours. But to enjoy the real beauty of the beach, one should stay for a few days in the area. The beach area is frequently crowded with various types of people and most of them come here to enjoy the natural views of the beach. \n\nThis is a sandy beach and got a higher rank in the top 10 list of the world. In fact, this is a beach that nobody wants to miss while they are on their trip to Greece. They key attraction of the beach is the sunset and sunrise scenes. A wide number of the people flock to the beach during the sunset and sun rising hours to enjoy the scenes. The beach is well organised and the surrounding environment is also charming. The pink sandy beach offers a great view to the horizon. The water is crystal clear and thus suitable for almost all types of activities on the water. People swim, participate in water sports, ride on water vehicles and more other activities. Besides, there are some small shops and stores are available that will help you get the necessary refreshment including bar service. the town is lively and the crowd of people is enjoyable.      \n\nThe majority of the visitors come here to enjoy the beautiful sunset scenes. The sun ray looks beautiful when it is about to set. The entire water turns in to a golden colour while the western sky becomes reddish. The view is excellent and a good number of the visitors only come here to enjoy the last moment of the day. By the same time, the small shops and bars allow the visitors to take light snacks and enjoy the sunset scenes with their near and dear ones. But the view is different in the morning or at the sunrise hour. There are fewer people at that moment for being the early hour of the day. But there are some people who come out to enjoy the morning beauty. Water sports is a common issue here and many of the visitors participate in the sports and enjoy themselves.     \n\nThis beach is wonderful. Without seeing the beauties in own eyes, anyone will not believe that how stunning the natural beauty of the locality is. Most of the time, foreign tourists suffer numerous troubles when they are in a new place. But I can assure that their experience will be different in this place. This is a safe and secured place. In fact, this is a small paradise to the visitors. The water is clear, warm and thus enjoyable to the fullest extent. The gentle breeze will make them feel comfortable. Moreover, the prices of everything here is reasonable. Hence, I will recommend it to every foreign tourist to visit the beach at least for once in their lifetime. They will be in love with this place."

    "Answer": "One of the special persons for me would be my wife. I met my wife in a church in the year 2000. We were Sunday school teachers back then, but we taught different classes. I was a teacher for the 5th and 6th grades in this school while she was teaching in the middle classes, which were the 3rd and 4th grades. During our Sunday school teaching era, there was a gathering, and I happened to be in the same group with her, and from there we started to have a lot of conversations together and we made phone calls every day.\n\nMy wife is a kind and friendly woman, as she likes to talk and make friends with many people. She likes travelling a lot and she was a former crew member of a local airline here in Indonesia. She had worked for about 10 years in the Company, but unfortunately, the Company was broke and decided to shut down the Airline. Besides travelling, my wife also has a passion for beauty and fashion, therefore she is planning to enroll in a Beauty and makeup class in the future.\n\nThere are a lot of things that we usually do together as a family. On the weekend, we usually go to the gym together. I like jogging on the treadmill while she prefers to exercise with the static bicycle. And we usually exercise for about one or two hours. And then both of us are movie lovers, therefore we like going to the Cinema together. We usually do it for about once or twice in a month, since we have a child these days, but before that, we routinely watched movies for about once or twice in a week. And lastly, we enjoy raising our child together, as we love little children. I believe that having a child for a young couple like us is just like being given the greatest gift in our lives.\n\nShe has a special place in my heart. I love her because she knows me better than anyone else in the world. She is a compassionate woman and loves me a lot. We spent time together, we share everything and she will be there for me no matter what. For the love and passion I feel for her and the way she loves me back make her a very special person in my life who means a lot to me indeed."

    "Answer": "My mother is the most important and special person in my life. She is the only one whom I adore most in my family for many reasons. She is really a wonderful woman I have ever seen. She is a very special one to me and I love her too much.  \n\nI am familiar with her since after my birth. She is the one who is taking care of me and my entire family. She is also responsible for many other relevant and irrelevant tasks of the family. Besides, she often needs to take care of the business of my dad. As a result, sometimes she also needs to move in places for out of home activities. But she is extremely careful in executing all her responsibilities. She took great care for me and other family members in the past and also now playing her role as an affectionate mother despite her thousands of business.\n\nMy mum is around 45 years old. But she still looks beautiful in her middle age. She was more beautiful in her early days. She got married to my dad at the age of 21 and they are still continuing the family for the long years without any serious troubles. She is an extremely kind lady and loves to socialise with people. She is well educated but I was amazed at the information that she completed the remaining part of her education after the marriage. My dad helped her greatly in completing the academic activities. I really wonder about this issue. However, my mum also loves to cook. In fact, she took training of three months on cooking numerous cuisine. She allows us to test her foods and when we nod at the cooking, she feels glad.\n\nMy mum is a busy woman. She has to remain busy round the day. But I am lucky enough that she manages half an hour time for me in the evening after I return home from college. She takes me beside her and feeds me like a kid of under 10 years. This is really an interesting event for me every day. This has become a daily routine for me and her. But if she is out of home for any purpose, she makes a phone call to me and informs me about her absence. Later, when she comes back, she feeds me the supper. In that time, she also enjoys television shows with me as well. I am matured enough to take my own care, but my mum still treats me like her underage son. I enjoy this thing much.   \n\nMy mum is special to me from many aspects. She is the only one who knows me very well. She understands my needs and tries her best to fill them up. Though I have two other siblings, she is more affectionate with me for I am the youngest of her children. When I was a kid, they said that I used to move with my mum like her shadow. Besides, she also loved me more than any other thing in the world. But she also did not compromise with her other relevant activities. it was really difficult to maintain everything equally but she did so. Hence, she has occupied a respectable position in my mind and this has made her special to me."

    "Answer": "My favourite photograph is the one which hangs in my bedroom that of me and my entire family - my family which consists of my parents, my kids and my spouse. This photograph was clicked on the eve of an auspicious festival of India which goes by the name of Diwali. The photograph was taken around two years back at our house by a professional photographer we hired from our area.\n\nThe reason why I would term this photograph as my favourite is that it is on this occasion that we all had the opportunity to be in the company of one another. It is so because I am a working executive and I generally remain busy on my tour jobs and get too little time to spend with my entire family. However, on this particular occasion, when this photograph was clicked, fortunately, I was available in my hometown to spend the entire weekend in their company.\n\nI like to look at this photograph very often and this gives me a delighted feeling. This is one of the prominent souvenirs of our family bonding and the reminder that family comes first. The happy moment of family members and their smiles in the photo reminds me how blessed and privileged I am to have such a happy and contented family life."

    "Answer": "Very recently, I have discovered an old photograph while checking some old documents. Now, this has become the most favourite photograph for me. I have started loving the photograph since I discovered it.  It's quite a pleasant surprise for me to have the opportunity to talk about this picture.\n\nThe photograph shows a newlywed couple. They are standing with a simple pose. In fact, the couple is my mum and dad. The photo was taken immediately after they got married. Besides, the background of the photo is also awesome. I think the marriage might have taken place beside a river or at any open space. This was a black and white photo and some of its parts have been damaged with the passage of time. the photo also shows some other people are standing behind my parents and everyone in the photo were looking cheerful. Besides, the photo is black and white. I think that was the age when black and white photographs were leading the time.\n\nThe photo was taken by a professional photographer of that time. The photographer has created a magical environment on the photo with some of the simple techniques. The photo looks wonderful even today and I admire the photographic sense of the photographer. The photo was taken marking the marriage of my parents. This is the first photo of my parent’s marriage and I think this one is the remaining one. In fact, the number of photos of their marriage is limited. In those days, capturing a photo was troublesome and expensive as well. Hiring a professional photographer was also an expensive issue to consider. Besides, the number of photos was also limited. So, I think they have not captured numerous photos as it is done in the present day.\n\nThe photo is about 30 years old. It is printed on a special paper. I have never seen black and white images in a printed form before. So, it was an interesting experience for me. My dad is in his 60s while my mum is around 52 years old. I am their youngest son. And thus I had a fascination to know about their marriage. In fact, I am planning to get married and thus wanted to get some tips from them about the marriage preparation, especially the photography. My mum laughed at me when I asked about the photography of their marriage event. Actually, I did not have any idea that photography was in the initial stage during the day they were married off.\n\nHowever, this is the ideal photo for me. it shows how the marriage ceremony took place in the past days. Moreover. I came to know about the decoration of my parent’s marriage. It was a mystery to me. I always wanted to know about the background of my family and marriage of my parent was an important aspect here. Besides, the photographer has clicked the photo with the right angle and all the components are equally present in the photo. I am amazed at the sense of composition in the photo. I, in fact, is in love with this old piece. Despite being old, this photo bears charm and I feel glad whenever I look at it. So, this is my favourite photograph."

    "Answer": "One of my passions from my teenage was to be an explorer, many people like Steve Austin, Bear Grills etc. really inspires me.  The way they explore new places, forests, remote islands, they hunt food, they illustrate survival skills techniques etc. are simply amazing.  I spend hours watching them on TV and YouTube.\n\nThough it is not a well-known profession, I think it will need education on nature and environment and biology and botany I guess? But the basic skill would be your knowledge on tackling those situations you are in.  Like how to get away with the dangers you may face during the exploration like wild animals, poisoned plants and all. It’s fun to watch but quite intimidating when you are in there!! I remember an episode of survivor series by Bear Grills where he had to drink his own urine to survive, from dehydration in a desert, then one place where he had seen off a grizzly in an open place, maybe you might run out of panic in that situation, but you could deal it well if you know how to and with your presence of mind.  It’s full of thrill!!  Such kind of situation really animates me!! It’s my passion and dream to have such a job. This offers the opportunity to live the life to its fullest.\n\nBut unfortunately, in India, my home country, such a profession doesn’t exist! I never heard of any Indian explorer of such kind. A wildlife photography would be the closest profession practised in India to this. It is not popular in our country and there is little chance that it would become popular in the near future. To grade it good or bad- it’s really difficult due to this. Again compared to an engineer or a doctor no one would appreciate such a profession in India except people like me who have a passion for exploring.\n\nI love to be an explorer as I said before, one reason I guess is that it is a job that satisfies my quest or hunger to explore. I really enjoy seeing myself in such sought of situations and adventure really thrills me. Maybe it is innate in my DNA!"

    "Answer": "Being a student of the undergraduate level, it is truly difficult to manage a full-time job. So, I would like to try for a part-time job from now. I am planning to be a sales executive at a computer hardware selling company.\n\nDespite being an ordinary one as a profession, this is a kind of dream job for me. Initially, I am planning to get involved as a part-timer with the job, but gradually I have a plan to be a full timer with this job. But that is in later stages and once my academic studies are done. The job is to provide with the necessary supports to the customers when they will come to purchase computer hardware. I want to have the job at a large computer hardware selling the company as they come with some specific extra benefits for the employees. The job responsibility may vary but I am ready to shoulder them.  \n\nA certain set of skills is necessary to do this job. First of all, the applicant for the job should have skills in dealing with computer hardware. A complete familiarity with the computer software and hardware is a must for the job. Besides, the applicant should also be an expert in managing a customer, provide them feedback in a satisfactory manner, answer their queries, then prepare memos after sales, meet any other needs from the customers’ part and more other duties and responsibilities. I believe I have all the skills necessary for the job. But I am unable to perform it as full-time as it will now allow me to complete my study. I am lucky enough to have the skills that I need to apply for the job and in some cases, I have more expertise than they require for the post.  \n\nThis is an ordinary job in my country but if someone could get involved in the job, s/ he does not need to worry about the job security. Besides, the larger companies that deal with the computer hardware and software actually takes care of their employees. They look after all the issues related to their company staff. Moreover, the salaries are up to the mark and smart. In fact, the job of a sales executive at a larger hardware selling company is becoming attractive in the present days for many reasons. This is a job that needs a special set of skills and the most important thing is that you will need to deal with various types of customers and clients. So, there is a great challenge in implementing the roles and responsibilities of the post.\n\nI would like to do the job for some reasons. I am fond of the computer since my early childhood. I have a special interest in dealing with computers – setting up the operating system for my mates, relatives and neighbours, troubleshooting of various computer hardware and more other. I was mad with the hardware while the programming is similarly difficult for me. So, I have not moved for learning programming rather I preferred the hardware. Now, I am almost an expert in computer hardware and if I have the job, it would be more beneficial for me to learn the other unknown aspects of computer hardware. Hence, I want to have the job and trying to get it at any larger computer hardware selling company here."

    "Answer": "Mobility is one of the most wanted things for the people who remain highly busy with their respective business. Only a car of own can remove the problem. Now, here I will describe how I bought my first car and thank you for the chance to describe the event here.  \n\nI have always dreamt of having a car of my own. But it was not so easy for me to afford the price of a car. In fact, being a small businessman, it was really hard for me to arrange all the money required to buy a new car. So, I started to save money for the purpose. Since I had to manage all the expenses of my family from my small income, it was hard for me to save money. But, by cutting and reducing my own expenses, I managed the entire cost to buy a car of my own.\n\nIt may sound strange to you. But this is true. I had to wait for long eight years. In each of the day of these years, I have saved the money. It was difficult indeed to save money and hold the attention for the purpose. Besides, there were no fixed amount to save. I have saved the money after my capacity. Often I have deposited cash and coins in the depository of my own which I made solely for this purpose. Interestingly, it was not me who saved money at the depository, rather my wife, kids and other family members also had their contribution to increasing the fund for having a car of my own. I am truly grateful to them for their selfless contributions. After passing around eight years, I found that I have gathered the required amount of money to buy a brand new car.        \n\nIn these years, I have experienced that saving money is the most difficult task for me. In fact, the range of expenses was on the rise but my business was not expanding in consideration of the expenses. But, I was determined to buy a car for me. It was becoming harder day after days to reach my business stations (I deal with export and import of poultry feed in Delhi and also own a small superstore in the city). I was unable to meet deadlines to meet with clients and others. Sometimes, I also have missed some deals with my clients for being late in the meeting place. There are many such other events are available to describe. Hence, I pledged to buy a car for me and I did it. I saved a small amount each day and finally I was able to accommodate the entire expense of my own car.\n\nThe feeling of having the car cannot be explained in words. It took me eight years to make my dream come true. In fact, it was not my dream, it was something more than a dream. It was a necessity for me. By the time, my business started growing and I needed to travel from one place to another. But I was determined that I would not take loans from a bank or any individual. It was my necessity and I will meet it no matter how long it takes. At last, I was able to get a car and when I brought it home, it appeared that it was the family member of mine for whom we all waited a long time."

    "Answer": "There were a lot of things that I had to save money for, but the one that I can remember very clearly was my first laptop. It was ten years ago when I was in the first year of university. I wanted to buy a laptop for my study; however, my parents would only pay for a desk computer, which was much cheaper at the time. So I had to save up the gap between a PC and a laptop, which was a huge gap for a uni student.\n\nBut I was determined to save up for my laptop, so I started to work part time as a private English tutor for high school students. The hourly rate was generous, but because I only had 2 students, I was not able to save up as quickly as I wished. Because I lived on the campus, so I could not cut down my accommodation cost. Instead, I cut my food spending, so for a few months, I did not have proper dinner.\n\nI felt like I had done everything I can to save up as quickly as possible, but in the end, it still took me almost a year. Because I had put so much effort in it, I felt incredibly proud when I finally had my laptop in my hands."

    "Answer": "Currently, I am a student at a university and we have to do group assignments and presentations. I would like to tell you about the group assignment that I have done with one of my friends from the University.\n\nLast semester we had a course on Company Law and one of the assessments for this course was an assignment. We have a case law and we needed to prepare an ILAC (Issue, Law, Application and Conclusion) for this case.\n\nWhen we have to do a group work, usually, I start the initial part and take necessary initiatives. I try to prepare a draft that we might read, check and change later to make it more appropriate. when I complete this revision, we start our work. Also, at the same time, my teammates prepare their drafts in order to have some information to compare.\n\nThe project I am talking about was a university project on ILAC and I worked on it with the collaboration of another student of my class. His name was Michael. He and I come from the same city and study in the same university. I chose this person because he also studies very well at the university and was quite cooperative. Both of us are doing the same degree and the same majors (accounting and finance). I believe that it is important to have cooperative and active team members in a group project or assignment. People with the same goals and mindsets can work smoothly together and can perform better. Additionally, I respect this person and value him as a good friend and good student. One of the most important aspects, why I worked with this particular student, was that he was very supportive, intelligent, reliable.\n\nWe had to prepare for the project from the very beginning. Both Michael and I prepared our drafts and to-do list to set our goal. Afterwards, we had to read a lot of reference books and case studies to finish our projects. A lot of discussions, debates, and coffee were needed to finish our assignment. We were very glad to be awarded the grade 'A' for our assignment."

    "Answer": "During my last semester, I underwent a thesis with two of my friends. And in fact, it was my group thesis. We three had to struggle a lot for collecting data from the primary sources. Besides, there were plenty of mistakes found in the literature. We all had to make the thesis perfect.\n\nThe thesis was about population distribution in rural and city areas and how to control the population flow. Definitely, it was a difficult task for us for some reasons. First of all, this was the very first thesis of our life. Actually, being the very first one, our teacher has asked us to make it in a group. Accordingly, we prepared for everything and did the project together. But on the way to completion, we had to experience a large number of troubles for being newbies in this arena of research and analysis.       \n\nI was responsible for preparing questionnaire for the thesis. In fact, we had to take interview of some of the people and the selection process was random. So, I had to prepare the questions in line with the thesis theme. By the same time, I had to care about the issue that there should be no irrelevant questions in the questionnaire lest the respondents do not feel irritated or disturbed. So, to prepare the questions, I took help from many other similar questionnaires. But it was hard to make the suitable questions. Besides, the formatting of the questions was also troublesome as I had never done such a work before. I was unable to find out the right format for me to place the questions. Developing the questions was also difficult and I overcome all the issues finally.  \n\nSteve and Smith were with me. I formed my team with them based on some special criteria. Firstly, they are my intimate buddies and we have a nice coordination. If I picked someone else, I think I would have been troubled more. They understand me while the things are similar to me. The coordination among us is excellent and we did some other projects before. But this was a large one in size and took more time than the usual projects. A thesis is completely a dissimilar type of work than the usual assignment. But we realised the issue much later. We had to face some extreme challenges to complete the thesis. Further, the teacher who assigned us the thesis was out of the country for attending some sort of conference. As a result, we all had to wait for his return and got delayed in submitting the thesis paper.   \n\nTo complete the thesis, I had to do some special sort of things in line with the others. Data collection was the most important aspect in thesis completion. To gather the data, we had to take interviews of some people both in rural and city areas. Cleaning the data and analyse them was the other greatest obstacles we experienced so far. Writing the report took a bit time. But the most unmanageable issue was the report writing. I was assigned to write the report as well but it took several attempts to complete the report and get it checked by the teacher. Finally, after lots of efforts, we were able to complete the project and it took around three months for us. It was really an interesting experience for me and others as well."

    "Answer": "I learned the Spanish language in my early school years and then moved to a different country with my parents. In three years I learned the very basic if this language and I am very much enthusiastic to enhance my proficiency in it. In fact, Spanish was my second language in my schools and I spent many hours studying and practising it not only to get a good grade on the exam but also to actually know this language.\n\nI did not have any alternative but to take part in the Spanish classes during my school days. However, in few days I found it very fascinating. I started spending a considerable amount of  time to learn more about this language and my mother bought me a story book written in Spanish. I was determined to be able to read it. That’s how I started to learn it. I had a moderate skill on handing the basic conversation and writing in Spanish. But a long time since then had passed and I never practised it later on.\n\nLearning a language is always helpful in terms of better understanding of their culture, tradition. It has other benefits like better migration and job aspects. I have few friends from Europe and they are my friends only because I could speak Spanish. I had also been able to read few books and magazines written in Spanish language and I enjoyed reading them thoroughly. I had twice been in Spain and I found the language knowledge very handy.\n\nMain reason I want to learn about it because I have a passion and enthusiasm to be able to speak Spanish fluently. My childhood memory is connected with it and I don’t want to miss any chance to worship my childhood memories.\n\nApart from that, being able to speak Spanish would be an excellent chance for me to meet new people and read many new books. It would also be helpful to get some privileges to get a better job in a large multinational organisation. Considering all of this fact, I am very much eager to further learn it."

    "Answer": "I always wonder how the strings make the sweet sounds attached to a light wood or plastic structure. In fact, it is a surprising issue to me. So, I want to learn more about playing the guitar. I can play the guitar to some smaller scale but I am interested in learning it more skillfully.\n\nGuitar is a sort of musical instrument and I am attracted to it since my early childhood. There are a wide number of variations are available but I love the one with six strings most. Sometimes, electric amplifiers or speakers are used to project the sound loudly. Playing the guitar is not so easy. The guitar player needs to pluck the strings with fingers or fingernails, and it should be continuous to create the rhythm. In most of the cases, the strings are made with steel and need tuning.  \n\n\\I was attracted with this musical instrument since my early days. But my attraction increased to this instrument after attending a live concert in my residing place in Mexico City. Some of the rock bands performed at the event and I was amazed at the performances. Each of the strokes in the guitar created a rhythm which was an unforgettable experience to me. After that night, I decided to learn guitar perfectly. In fact, I have a guitar at my home and I play it irregularly. So, I am not a skilled guitarist. Moreover, due to my academic engagements, I am unable to concentrate on learning too. All such matters have made my interest in learning to play the guitar more accurately.    \n\nThe benefits are huge. In fact, learning to play the guitar will be an advantage for me. I want to be a singer in future and it is my passion. If I know how to play the guitar, I could sing songs very well. Further, keeping the practice of guitar will also help me to be in touch with the instrument. In fact, this is a skill and if I do not care for it, someday I will lose it. All my struggles to learn the guitar will go in vain. The most impressive benefit of learning guitar is that it keeps the memory sharp and boosts the creativity level. It also provides a sense of joy inside my mind and removes my worries away. Composing newer tunes is really enjoyable with the guitar. Furthermore, guitar lessons also help to synchronise my physical and mental faculties together. So, it appears that the benefits of learning guitar are adorable.\n\nFrankly speaking, I am obsessed with the guitar. I have passed many days and times after this instrument. But I was unable to learn something special. With the help of internet and some of my seniors, I have learnt the basics and practice them. But to be a passionate musician, I need to learn guitar completely. This is a kind of most necessary and basic musical instrument that a musician should know about. The more I will learn it, the more I will be skilled in playing the guitar. The synchronisation with the guitar tune with my fingers will be more smooth. The saying goes that practice makes a man perfect. I want to be a perfect guitarist. For all such reasons, I want to learn guitar more."

    "Answer": "My plan to settle and work in a first world country is yet to be achieved. This is an ambition and plan I have for a long. After I got admitted to the university, I had some double about my major, which is 'Social Science'. To be honest I was a bit frustrated not to study either in Engineering or in Medicine. However, in few months I started loving this subject I was studying and started feeling the immense possibility this might have in my future. That I time I considered settling in a first world country for the higher study and work.\n\nTo be more precise, I have this ambition for the last 5 years. This ambition started forming in my head when I was in the second term in my university which would be around June 2011.\n\nFirst of all, I need a really impressive result in my Masters Degree program so that I can get a scholarship in a reputed university. The admission in a top rated university in a first world country would be the first step in fulfilling my ambition. Then I would need to study and research really hard to have a prominent presence there so that I can get a decent job offer. My dedication, determination and hard work would be the vital factors for achieving this ambition.\n\nThis is very important for me to work and settle in a first world country. First of all, I have a fascination about researching in my study field and I am sure that would be better facilitated in a first world country. The career prospect and research facilities in my country are not that promising and I have an aspiration to contribute to a great extent in the arena I have my knowledge. Considering all these, it’s really important for me to achieve my ambition."

    "Answer": "Currently I am an undergraduate and studying Film and Television at the University of Bristol. I have an ambition to complete my post-graduation on the subject and I would like to be a filmmaker. Hence, I am planning to take the higher degree in this field.\n\nFilm and Television is one of the most prominent subjects in the present days. It has numerous potentials. In fact, to be a noted filmmaker, you will need to have the right amount of knowledge with you to produce some quality programmes. But without the proper knowledge about film and television, this is quite impossible to make the programmes, television shows or any film. A notable number of the filmmakers and television celebrities have their higher degree on this subject or any other scholarly courses related to their profession. So, I want to see myself in a higher position than as it is now.\n\nI have to wait for three more years to achieve the post-graduation. I have two more years to complete my graduation and after that I will get admission in the post-graduation of this subject. This university is specialised in this subject and helps the students to gain some practical knowledge in film making, producing television programmes, film making analysis, practical other related issues and more. Once the graduation is complete, I could be able to seek the admission for the next phase. In fact, this is really difficult to get admission at this university. The number of admission seekers is more than the seats available. Besides, due to the name and fame of the courses, I might have to compete with some external candidates as well to ensure my berth on the post-graduation.  \n\nBefore reaching to the MA in Film and Television studies, I have to cross the barriers of my graduation first. But, I am having troubles with some of the specific issues. I am unable to comprehend the script writing process. It becomes hard for me to imagine the situations, describe them in language and make the complete script. But I hope I would overcome the situation within a short time because I have been focusing on script preparation for last couple of weeks. Besides, without a special score, it is tough to get admission in the post-graduate programme. So, I also need to focus on all the other subjects so that I could have an outstanding result to apply for the post-graduation.\n\nI have a long story to tell in brief. In fact, I was a student of science until my graduation. I started watching films more and more to pass my leisure hours before the graduation admission. Suddenly I realised that it would be nice to be a filmmaker. But that needs a special set of skills and expertise. Later I came to know about the Film and Television study which helps to be a filmmaker. From that moment, I have set my goal to complete my post-graduation on this subject. Besides, some of the renowned filmmakers and television professionals regularly take classes at the university which also will assist me to reach my goal. Thus this is very important for me to achieve my MA in Film and Television studies."

    "Answer": "Life in Paris is really tough unless you can organise any suitable profession for you. Here I work as a part-time employee at a restaurant to bear my expenses. After working at the restaurant, I have developed an ambition to have a restaurant of my own.\n\nI love to work in the restaurant. And I am responsible for dealing with the customers, collect the bills, take care of the inventory and more. Sometimes, I also take care of the kitchen and serve the waiting customers with drinks and other necessary assistances. The owner of the restaurant also works hard and as a result, his business has expanded to the largest possible extent. Often I have to assist the owner and come to know about many aspects that were unknown to me. Hence, I have formed the ambition to be a restaurant owner like him. This is an independent business.\n\nI have been working as a part-timer for one and a half year. In fact, I need to meet my educational and personal expenses with my earning. In fact, I am a student of a locally reputed university and bearing all the costs of my own. This is really interesting to bear the costs at an early age. As a direct consequence, I have come to know about many realities of life and made a plan to make my life decent. I will have to wait for seven to eight years more to have a restaurant of my own. It needs lots of preparations. And most importantly, I have to learn how to run and manage a restaurant effectively. I have considered this as a learning period for me. I am learning everything to manage it. But waiting a long time is really difficult for me.\n\nOpening a restaurant is not a big deal indeed. But there are several chances of fall if someone with the business does not have the proper idea to manage the restaurant. The existing owner, where I am working now, is an experienced individual and knows perfectly to deal with the restaurant activities. In his early life, he also was an assistant like me and learnt the necessary things as I am learning now from him. Besides, arranging for money is another important issue. Just opening a restaurant does not mean that you will have floods of euros. Rather, it requires a specific time to get established among its potential customers and clients. Moreover, I need to learn different culinary arts to satisfy my clients and ensure their return to my restaurant. Arranging for reliable staffs is another important issue to consider. If the staffs are not suitable or impolite with the customers, it would bring a disgrace for the business.   \n\nThis is really an important goal for me to achieve. Though I am from a wealthy family, I want to grow by myself and without the support of my family. Hence, I have taken the decision. Besides, without an ambition, I do believe that an individual cannot go far. It is the ambition that creates the spirit inside to move forward, stand against the odds and walk over the obstacles. When the destination arrives, the moments are extremely happy and enjoyable. People becomes free and can do whatever they want. To be happy in life, it important to have the capacities in doing something without supervision. And it is only the desired goals or ambitions that lift up the people on that position. I want to be independent my work and decisions. Thereby, this important for me to achieve it."

    "Answer": "I went to a café about two weeks ago to attend a birthday celebration of one of my colleagues and this was a unique place that caught my eyes. The name of this café is ‘Café Metro’ and it’s near the City centre shopping mall. I was a bit inquisitive about the birthday celebration in a café. But after I reached there, I found out it was quite a large place and in fact had much more facilities than a conventional party centre.  I once heard about this café but never went there as it is located far away from my house and office.\n\nIt was Thursday evening when one of my colleagues reminded me the birthday invitation of Mike. I went to the café with 3-4 colleagues and before reaching there we bought a gift for Mike.\n\nThere were about 30 people in total and most of them were my colleagues. I wished Mike a happy birthday and gave the present we bought. I sat in a corner and enjoyed the soft music that was playing. A piece of birthday cake was served and it was the first thing I ate there. After that, I drank a glass of water. I was then asked whether I would like to join the supper of wait a while. I had to get back home early that day and that’s why instead of a dinner, I preferred to eat my supper. But to my amazement, more than 20 items were served which were white heavy for the evening meal. However, I ate the soup first and then went for the traditional Italian item called primo. Then I ate antipasto before I ate the dessert. There were probably more items in the supper but I was full and did not eat anything further.\n\nI would say I had a very delightful experience in this café. The environment was quite unique with gorgeous painting and decoration. The spacious café offered an excellent experience that made me like this place very much. The food items were delicious and the service boys were very friendly and amiable."

    "Answer": "Living in a busy city like Kuala Lumpur is really troublesome because there are few places to sit and gossip. My recent visit to a small café in the city has made me feel irritated. This was an unhappy event for me and I will describe the event in as brief as I can.\n\nThe café is located in the downtown of Kuala Lumpur. It is small in size and the seating arrangement allows around 15 people to sit at a time inside the café. Besides, there are some other seating arrangements outside. Since the café is located beside a busy street, the environment is really horrible. There are people everywhere and you cannot have peace of mind for a single moment. The majority of the visitors take their seats outside as the inside remains filled always. To take a seat inside the café, you need to reserve or move early for it. The food quality was also unsatisfactory as well.\n\nAfter passing a hefty in the college, I wanted a refreshment and thus visited the café with some of my college mates. In fact, this was the nearby café from my college and it was a five-minute walk. We all planned to pass a wonderful evening at the café, gossip for hours and then return home with a refreshed mind. As per the plan, we moved for the café. Though I objected over the selection of this particular café, they denied my objection for it was the closest one we had then. Moreover, the day was long and we attended three classes continuously. So, they did not want to move to a distant place. We walked down there and took seats outside of the café. Our waiting started since we took the seats.\n\nIt was almost dusk. So, we planned to take some light snacks and drinks. We ordered for chicken fries and coffee. I took a set of chicken balls instead of chicken fries. Besides, I took a cup of coffee. But we stayed there for over two hours and ordered for another time. This time we took some heavy foods. I ordered for a chicken burger while the others ordered for various food items including beef kebab, pizza, chicken grill and more. This time we also ordered for soft drinks. After finishing the foods, we ordered for coffee for another time. In fact, it was a heavy meal for almost every one of us. The food was too heavy for me and I was unable to take my supper on that night.      \n\nI disliked the café for some specific reasons. First of all, the service was not up to the mark. They had fewer employees to run this café. There were 30 persons altogether in the café whereas they had only four employees to serve the customers. So, most of the time, the people had to wait in a queue and waited for their turn to come. Moreover, the charged more than the usual rate in the name of serving the best foods. But my experience was different in this case. I found some foul smell emitting from the dishes when I came here for the first time. The similar thing happened with me this time. An unusual smell was emitting from the burger that I ordered and had to wait for long 20 minutes to replace the faulty burger. Considering all the matters, I am displeased with this café."

    "Answer": "I am a regular internet user. It would not be an exaggeration if I say that I am a technophile and a netizen. On an average, I spend around 10-12 hours online due to my profession in software development and personal interest. I run two blogs: one personal and another one on technology and this increase the amount of time I spent online. In fact, I learn so many things every day during my internet surfing. For this topic, I would talk about a really interesting thing that I learned many years ago which is related to human interaction in search results in famous search engines like Google and Bing.\n\nThe term is commonly called Golden triangle that represents the human eye hit maps on the search results. The search engines like Google and Bing and also Yandex and Baidu are market leaders. They serve an unbelievable amount of data to internet searchers and lots of research are conducted to present the most relevant and accurate data to the searchers.\n\nThe golden triangle is the hit map of human eye activity on the search engine result pages and this looks like the English alphabet “F”. This means all the search engine users look more on the upper-left corner of the screen and then on the right side. The eye hit map presents that the search results that are placed on the top (upper-left) have a better chance to be noticed by the searchers and thus get more traffic.\n\nI was reading an online article by one of the prominent online research websites and that article particularly caught my eyes. This was actually a 6-7 page article and the illustration and data was so interesting that I could not leave my desk until I finished the whole article. To dig further I read some other relevant articles and blog posts and the whole idea of researching user interactivity while searching was fascinating.\n\nThe search engines are the doorway to the internet and according to a recent statistics, Google alone gets more than 200 million searches every day. Since traffic driving and doing well with websites and online business rely heavily on search engines, I often read articles and research papers about search engine optimisation. This article gave me a good insight on human interaction on the screen and thus helped me think in a different way to implement my efforts to help clients get a better position in search engines. So I would say that was a really fascinating thing to learn."

    "Answer": "In the Asian subcontinent, it is the girls who are responsible for handling all the cooking for the family. So, I am not an exception rather I love to cook. Besides, I conduct experiments and try to bring some innovation and variety in my cooking approach. I am glad to describe the matter here. I would like to thank you for this great topic.  \n\nI learnt cooking various types of dishes. In fact, people of Sri Lanka take the most usual dishes like rice and curry. They also take some occasional foods which also contain various types of rice and curries. But I have learnt something different. Using the internet, I came to know about many special dishes that I can make with the usual elements of my country. So, I did not miss the chance. I have learnt a couple of exotic dishes and often prepare them for my family. They become pleased with the dishes and praise my skills of cooking.  \n\nThere are a good number of websites are available which teach cooking. In fact, they provide the recipe of numerous dishes and I have picked the best ones which appeared easy to me. I regularly browse websites like epicurious.com, allrecipes.com, cooking.com, meals.com etc. They are the leading websites that describe the recipes for numerous types of food preparation. Besides, they are also easy to use and the recipes are provided with great care. Initially, I had to struggle with the cooking but a regular practice has removed the challenges and barriers for cooking. Now, I have become almost a perfect cook of my family. They all love my cooking and extensively praise and inspire me. Often I think that the websites were of great help to me. In fact, without their support, I was unable to learn the cooking.     \n\nAt first, I started visiting the websites for passing my idle moments. Later, the idea crossed my mind that if I try something different, it would make my family members happy. Yes, I know ow to cook but I have never tried something special except the rice and curry. So, I planned to cook something special that my family members have never tested before. Accordingly, I went to the grocery shop and market to get the necessary items after the recipe. Then I made the dish. It was a bit trouble for me as I tried the exotic dish for the first time. In fact, the heat was not in the right amount. I removed the pot from the stove too early before the meat to be boiled. But my parents were happy with this and inspired me to continue my efforts.   \n\nIt was really an interesting experience for me. Firstly, I loved cooking but never had tried the dishes before. Besides, cooking preparation was a bit dissimilar than we cooked. In fact, there are some basic differences with the western foods and the foods with this continent. The western foods are undoubtedly healthy and delicious. But they lack spices as we take in our curries. Moreover, the cooking recipe was also dissimilar than ours. Preparation of the dishes are easier but it appeared to me that the cooking takes a bit more time than we need to invest for our traditional foods. So, I made the mistakes in the beginning and now this is alright. I actually enjoy cooking the dishes to a great extent."

    "Answer": "I am incredibly lucky, because I live in the UK, and we have the BBC – British Broadcasting Company, which is funded by a licence fee payable by all British households, companies and organisations. As such, it has a particular public service broadcasting remit, it isn’t funded by advertising, and is expected to produce quality, unbiased factual and ‘public interest’ material. Amongst other things, it has an educational responsibility as part of its remit. Perhaps because of this, the BBC is renowned worldwide for the quality of some of its programmes. In particular, its wildlife broadcasting is breathtakingly good.\n\nIt happens, that only today I watched the most amazing wildlife documentary, I’m going to tell you all about. What it was on, what channel it was broadcast on and what I learned from it. I think it will be pretty obvious why it is so brilliant – not just in worthy educational terms, but as extraordinary visual entertainment too.\n\nThe programme was just one of a whole series called ‘The Hunt’. Each episode concentrates on a different part of the natural world, taking an intimate and detailed look at the remarkable strategies employed by hunters to catch their prey and what the hunted have to do to escape. Today’s episode was called, ‘Hunger at sea’ and was about the oceans. Amongst other things, the team had spent years trying to get footage of remarkable marine animals including blue whales – which are the heaviest animal ever to have existed on our planet (it’s 30 metres long, and they weigh appreciably more than even the largest of known dinosaurs), but can still be elusive in the vast expanse of the seas. However, the programme looked at lots of different creatures as well as the blue whales. There were films of sharks, sea lions, frigate birds, dolphins and albatrosses cleverly revealing the strategies they use to hunt for prey in the big blue waters of the oceans. I don’t live near the sea so whilst I know it’s beautiful and I worry a lot about pollution impacting on it, I don’t get to see if very often. This programme demonstrated that the open ocean is an immense wilderness that covers more than half the surface of our planet, yet for the most parts, it's a watery desert, largely devoid of life. It is a fragile ecosystem, and predators face an endless search to find and catch food, yet these great tracts of ocean are home to some of the most remarkable hunters on the planet.\n\nThe production values of the series were beyond your wildest imaginings. The film footage is remarkable. It took two years, but a team of scientists and underwater photographers eventually got footage not only of a blue whale – a rare enough achievement in itself, but a blue whale feeding on a massive ball of krill, gulping in water and the tiny zooplankton creatures all at once.  It was really extraordinary to see. The programme series is being narrated by Dir David Attenborough – he is a well-respected broadcaster and scientist who delivers interesting information with passion and clarity. The photography though is just amazing. Close up shots of these extraordinary creatures in their natural habitat, the tenacity and dedication of the production teams in obtaining such footage can only be imagined. The programme is currently on BBC1, but I’m sure it will end up being broadcast worldwide as well.\n\nI learned so much about marine life, ecosystems and how so many animals survival is interconnected. It makes me sad that our oceans are being polluted and fish stocks over-fished, but I take hope that such extraordinary television programmes might help raise awareness about the complexity and fragility of life in the seas. The programme gave a glimpse of an underwater world that would be otherwise impossible to see, it not only increased my knowledge, but the footage obtained is of scientific importance too, because they were able to capture on film animal behaviour that has never been recorded before. That’s quite something. I think this programme series The Hunt, is well deserving of the accolade of a brilliant education TV programme on natural history. If you get the chance to see it, do so!"

    "Answer": "A few years ago, I was very fond of watching television programmes but I was a bit selective in that case. I saw only the highly educative programs on television. And in this case, Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey was the best one for me. Here, I will give a brief description of the television show.  By the way, these days I can hardly manage times to watch TV programmes and mostly watch BBC or CNN for global news and updates.\n\nCosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey began as a television show in 2014. This is a TV series that deals with the past, present and future of the space activities. Besides, the existing show was the follow up of another show that took place in the 1980s, which was named as Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. Days have been passed and the show started a new journey with newer topics. The earlier one has been considered as the milestone for scientific documentaries on television and has started a new era in the exploration of space. Even today, the show is as popular as it was in the past days.   \n\nThe first show was telecasted on the Public Broadcasting Service in the USA and now the later one is telecasted on the 10 channels of 21st Century Fox network. The channels broadcast the show in different times of the weeks and thus I could manage my convenient time to enjoy the show. To make the show, relevant people had to struggle a lot and preparation began a couple of years ago. Detailed plans were made and it also required a huge financial investment. Neil deGrasse Tyson currently hosts the show and he got inspiration to present the show from the previous one when he was a high school student in the 1980s. The show is made with different attractive stories. The impressive feature of the show is the updated use of graphics and special effects to make the events reliable than it was before.\n\nI learnt various information about space from this television show. The narrative technique of the show is simple – it appears that the host is telling a story and showing evidence in favour of his story. Besides, the information and facts represented in the show are real and trustworthy. In fact, it does not exhibit some fictional facts to grab attention from the audience. The present show comes with the latest available information about the space and deals with the future events that may take place after many years. The extensive use of graphics and animation is a great feature of this program that has made learning easier. Due to its popularity, the series was available around the globe on numerous television channels until the end of the season.  \n\nThis is surely a great educational program. Before the broadcasting of this program, there were no such educative programs before. This program has gained a huge popularity. The second part of the series underwent several struggles and challenges. Many of the television channels turned reluctant to telecast the program. They were unable to analyse the educative value of the program. But later the program has won several awards for its educative contents. In fact, the contents of the program help us thinking about the outer space and other related matters. It creates a sensitivity among the viewers. So, I think this was really an educative series I have ever seen."

    "Answer": "Buildings are strange things, they are easy to take for granted if they are the ones you live near to and pass by every day, but some buildings are really remarkable, and not always for outwardly obvious reasons. It would be easy to pick an ‘unusual’ building that has an extraordinary external architecture, and of course, they can be remarkable, impressive and on occasion beautiful. However, the building I want to talk about is certainly unusual, unique even, but you wouldn’t necessarily know this unless you went inside.\n\nSo I’ll tell you where it is and what it looks like, why I went there, and explain what it is that makes it so rare.\n\nThe building is in Sheffield where I live. It is a large tower block and as well as being the second tallest building in the city I am told it is the tallest university building in the UK. It is known as 'The Arts Tower', because those are the subjects that were originally taught inside its four walls. Degrees like modern languages, philosophy and other Humanities disciplines. It is a classic 60’s tower, twenty stories high and constructed of concrete and glass. Honestly, it’s not particularly attractive - not in my eyes anyway, though it is typical of that era in architectural terms. Even so, it is something of a local landmark, because it is so high you can see it from almost anywhere in the city. It has so many glass windows that in certain lights the building seems to change colour as they reflect the light of the skies outside. It can look like burnished gold in sunset, or in the dark, when the internal lights are on, it is lit up like a Christmas Tree. I wouldn’t call it beautiful, but it is striking. However, these factors, ‘though ‘interesting’, aren’t what make the building so unusual. The reason I made a special visit to see inside it, is because of what lies within…\n\nThe building was constructed with a really rare and unusual elevator. It’s called a Paternoster Lift, and before I moved to Sheffield I’d never even heard of one. They are a little tricky to describe, but I’ll have a go! Essentially, a paternoster lift is a passenger elevator which consists of a chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two persons) that move slowly in a loop up and down inside a building without stopping. Passengers can step on or off at any floor they like, but the lift just keeps moving so they have to be quick! There are no sliding doors to shut you in the elevator, you just step in the opening and stand in it until it reaches the floor you want, when you carefully step out as the chain of ‘boxes’ just carries on in slow but continuous motion. The design is pretty ancient, going back to the 1880s, so at the time they were first created they must have seemed extraordinarily innovative, but now the lift is unusual because it is such historic engineering. Very few of the lifts survive because of safety concerns - the continuous motion and open ‘doors’ means people can fall going in and out, and a few years ago someone was actually killed using one getting caught in the mechanism somehow as the compartment they were in transitioned from going up one side to going down in the loop the other at the top of the lift. Sheffield, however, has kept its paternoster lift and kept it in working order too. I think it might be the largest one in the world, at 38 separate compartments (or maybe they should be called carriages), but it is definitely the largest in the UK.\n\nI made a special visit to the building to try out the lift with a friend. In such a technological age where we take things like escalators – even flying for granted, it was a strangely unsettling experience. It actually took a little while to pluck up the courage to step into the moving platform as it passes by as you have to time your entrance quite carefully. Similarly, you need to judge it carefully getting off, too slow and there isn’t time to jump before you are taken off to the next floor, too fast and you might bump your head as the opening isn’t quite clear. There is a definite knack to it! It was like travelling back in time, you could imagine people in Victorian times in England being astonished at such extraordinary technology, it is impressive now – it must have been mind-blowing then!\n\nSo I think this building is unusual because it contains a piece of living history. A working paternoster lift that is possibly unique in size, and certainly extremely rare. The building also has a couple of conventional elevators now, as well as stairs for people to use. However, the paternoster lift is still there, turning slowly, and it is quite fun to have a ride, like travelling back in time on an ancient fairground ride! The building is also a rather literal reminder that you shouldn’t make assumptions only by what is most obvious – you just wouldn’t know from the unpromising exterior of the Arts Tower what lies within! Sometimes if you look beneath the surface a little, very remarkable things emerge. Hence the saying ‘don’t judge a book by its cover!’"

    "Answer": "A curved building, a gigantic animal shape in front of a building, crazy arts etc. are quite magnificent architectural examples I have witnessed many times in my life. But nothing can be as unusual or unique than the ‘Basket Building’ I have seen in Ohio, United States. \n\nThis building is the head-quarter of the Longaberger Company and this is a famous manufacturer and distributor of handcrafted maple wood baskets and other home and lifestyle products in the United States. This giant basket building is situated in Dresden, Ohio in the United States. One of my maternal uncle lives in Ohio and I went to visit his house two years back. While visiting different places with my cousins I noticed this building and the exceptional and strange design of this building simply stunned me.  \n\nThis building is a giant basket like building. It might give you the impression that a picnic basket has been kept on the side of a park. The idea of establishing a building that represents the corporate brand and the main product the company manufactures was indeed a genius one. It is a 7-story large building which is the head-quarter of the Longaberger's Home Office. This is perhaps the largest basket monument human has ever created. I heard from my cousin that it is around 200 feet long and 136 feet wide. After I returned home and search for more information about this building and found some interesting facts like it took more than 2 years to be completed and it cost 30 million dollars. It occupies more than 25 acres area and the basket handles were settled on the top of this building using 150 tonnes weight copper and wooden rivets.\n\nAs I told that, my concept of strange building and monument was redefined after I saw this building. It was quite unique, some would say bizarre.  I think this is the strangest building I have ever seen because of its architectural design and structure. Anyone who has never seen this building would be puzzled and would agree that this is a strangely designed and unusual looking building."

    "Answer": "China is a beautiful country with lots of high rising structures. But the Beijing National Stadium attracts me most. It comes with a special type of design and architecture. In fact, this is one of the largest sporting ground in the entire country.\n\nThe stadium is located in Beijing. It is also known as the Bird’s Nest for its weird size, shape and design. Actually, it looks like a bird’s nest from top and different from the other ordinary stadium. A huge amount of money has been spent to complete the construction of this gigantic building. A couple of architects, artists and designers have worked together on this project. The stadium was made to hold the Summer Olympics and Paralympics in 2008. Then it was planned that the Bird’s Nest will be used again in 2022 to hold the Winter Olympics and Paralympics.   \n\nThe large stadium really looks like a nest of a bird. In fact, the design is made so. To make the views clearer, the eastern and western stands of the stadium is placed on a higher location while the other stands are a bit lower. As a result, each of the spectators can have a clear view of the events happening on the ground. There are mechanisms to make the stadium hot during winter and cold during summer days. Initially, the design was done to hold about 100,000 spectators. Later, the number decreased due to some modifications inside the structure. The current capacity of the stadium is 80,000 spectators at a time. Ventilation system is modern and there are fewer chances of suffocation inside the stadium building. It looks attractive from a distant view.      \n\nThe stadium holds different types of events including football matches, athletic events, concerts and others. I have visited the stadium several times marking various occasions and celebration. I went there for the first time to enjoy the closing ceremony of Summer Olympics in 2008. It was a magnificent event indeed and I enjoyed them a lot. Besides, I also went there to enjoy some football matches between various teams that took place in the stadium. I can recall the Italian Super Cup final match very clearly and it was a high voltage match to me. Enjoying the China Cup match was another exciting experience for me in July of 2012. The motor racing carnival is another important event that I should mention here. And also I do not miss the concerts that take place in the stadium.\n\nThis is an unusual building to me for various reasons. This was planned to hold some important events so that China could be one of the global stakeholders of such events like Olympics. But unluckily, the stadium has been being ignored in some cases. It remains unused in most of the times of year and only a few events take place at some particular times. I think this is not fair with such a huge structure. There should be events in regular intervals round the year. Further, the structure looks gigantic with its special shape and size. The seating capacity is surely adorable which has made it unique in some senses. So, this is an unusual building in some particular sense."

    "Answer": "Oh no, this is a great topic to talk about and it is slightly embarrassing to describe! You ask how old I was when I got lost as if this is something that can only happen to you as a child. Unfortunately, the example I am thinking about is rather more recent.  I’ll try and explain what happened, where – I will tell you how old I was if you like, and I’ll certainly describe what it felt like too.\n\nSo, the situation was just a couple of months ago. I’ve fairly recently taken up a new hobby of running. I’m not very good at it, I’m very slow, and I just like to use it as a way to see interesting and beautiful sceneries. I prefer running trails, that is going cross country, rather than running on roads, but that can be a problem as you need to be able to navigate, and I’m not very good at that either! I heard about a fell race that was taking place a short drive away from where I live. It was a 5 mile route across open countryside, such events usually use footpaths and some trails, but there is a risk you can lose your way. Because I’d never done anything like this before I emailed the organisers in advance. I explained I was worried about getting lost and that I was also very slow, so I didn’t want to find myself stuck out on the open moor when night fell! I got a lovely reply. The organiser assured me that she herself could ‘get lost going upstairs in my own house’ so she had personally put out really clear markers along the whole route. What’s more, there would be a back-marker bringing up the rear. ‘Honestly’ she said ‘there is really no way you can get lost or come last, I promise!’ Can you guess what happened?\n\nThe day of the event dawned. Everyone took off, and after the first couple of miles, I found I was running alone. All the faster runners had sprinted off out of sight. I wasn’t last, I could at first hear the back-marker laughing and joking with some really slow runners at the back – one of whom had to go extra steady because of a heart condition. The course was well-marked, and I enjoyed running through woodland, lolloping through fields and even along a few country paths. Towards the end of the race, I entered a thick patch of trees. The marker flags turned off sharply to the right and I followed them – straight to the banks of a stream. I was really confused, the path just ended at the water. I went on for a bit, but no more way markers or signs, I stared at the water again. I retraced my steps, but the signs were really clear. Then I had a ‘lightbulb’ moment, I suddenly realised this was a fell race so it was designed to be challenging. I ‘obviously’ had to just wade across the stream to the other side, and so I did. Only to end up in really thick bracken and bramble undergrowth. There was no path there. I was so confused, I crossed back over the river, and repeatedly checked for signs, but I just couldn’t find the route. In the end, I double backed about half a mile to try and find the backmarker, but they had vanished too. After about 10 minutes (though it felt like much longer) I found a different way out of the woods and saw the race finish. Everyone was there waiting for me in a bit of a panic, as they couldn’t work out how the backmarker (who was supposed to come in last to make sure everyone had finished safely) had somehow come back before me. Because we all had numbers, they had realised that I was still out on the course but they couldn’t work out where I could possibly be. I ran back rather lopsidedly, and soaking wet from having waded back and forth across the stream countless times. Breathless at the end I explained that I was sure I’d followed the path correctly yet somehow I had achieved the impossible thing of both getting lost AND finishing last!  It didn’t make any sense…\n\nThe organisers couldn’t understand it, they went back into the woods to see what had happened. It turned out that some vandals had set a false trail in the woods. The other runners had all been in sight of someone in front so hadn’t really been looking at the markers, only following the person in front. The back marker was local and knew the way, so she too hadn’t needed to check the route either. Hence, it was only me that got caught out. How unlucky! So how old was I, well fifty – you apparently don’t have to be a child in a fairy tale to get lost in the woods! As to how I felt, well initially confused, a little alarmed and then embarrassed as I couldn’t work out how it happened. Once there was an explanation I felt a bit better. The event organisers were lovely and friendly and very concerned that his had happened – but it wasn’t their fault, it was just one of those unlucky things. However, once it was all over, I thought it was hilarious. No one was hurt and in a funny way, it boosted my confidence because the two things I’d dreaded most had happened, and actually, it didn’t matter one bit! Even so, next time, I think I’ll look at the intended route more carefully on a map before setting off!"

    "Answer": "I was a very naughty kid in my childhood days. Bunking school was a usual phenomenon for me and some of my friends. In fact, the attempts were dangerous for me and them. Now I will describe how I lost one day.\n\nI with two of my friends went to the Sydney Stadium to enjoy a high voltage football match. So, we made a plan on the previous day to bunk the school. Unluckily, I was unable to take the necessary preparations as dad dropped me at the school gate. However, I managed to escape the school with them. We travelled here and there in the city, did many things, took our lunch and so on. Finally, we reached at the stadium before the match began. We entered into the stadium and enjoyed the match. The trouble began when we started to get back home. My pockets were empty. I have spent all of my money round the day like an inconsiderate.\n\nThe event took place at the stadium. In fact, the situation was the same for the two others. Peter and Thomas, both had spent their bucks on the lunch and soft drinks, ticket of the match, buying badges for the team we supported etc. The situation was like that we did not have a single penny to pay for the transportation to way back to home. I was lost. Actually, we all were lost. There were no other ways to us to get rid of the situations. By the same time, it was becoming dark. Our school began at 7.30 am and ended by noon. But I told mum that I would go Peter’s home for some home works and participating in sports, and will be back by evening. The distance of our residence was moderate from the stadium. In fact, it took around 20 minutes to reach in our residential block from the stadium by bus.\n\nI was 12 or 13 but I cannot exactly remember the age. It was the beginning of my teenage. By the same time, it was the age to explore the world. The curious mind wanted to see the unseen and know the unknown. As part of the curiosity, I along with some of my friends started to see the world. In fact, Sydney was the world for us. We travelled in various corners of the city and passed our days amid great fun. The time was not so modern and the development of the city did not happen so much as it is today. Besides, we used to change our school uniform so that people could not understand we bunked the school. The idea was my brainchild.\n\nBut it was sad for all the three of us. We were lost. We started feeling hungry. But we were unable to buy any food to satisfy the hunger. Gradually tension aroused. Finding other ways, three of us started walking to home. But the streets were unfamiliar to us. Actually, we came there by public transport and the bus moved in various parts of the city. Hence, it was really difficult for us to spot the streets that will lead us to home. Later, we reached home safely but made late. Each of us managed our parents that saying that we had spent much time on the outdoor sports and thus we made late. I was relieved and learnt some lessons as well."

    "Answer": "Well, the first company that popped up in my mind after I read the topic of this cue card is known as ‘The rainfall’ and this is a readymade garments manufacturer in our hometown. In just 4-5 years this company has gained a huge popularity in the local and in some foreign markets and has expanded from a 10 employee-run company to a workplace for more than few hundred employees. In term of their success, I can say that this company is the role-model for many newly established companies in this same sector.\n\n‘The rainfall’ is an interesting name and in a TV interview one of the founding members of this company told the history of this company and according to him the day they decided to establish this company was a rainy day and it was pouring heavily and ceaselessly.\n\nSince this company  is located in our hometown where I have observed their first establishment till their latest expansion in the capital city, I know most of the history of this company. One of the founding members is a relative of one of my friends and I have visited the main office of this company more than once.\n\nThis company mainly produces readymade garments for ladies and gents of all ages and then it sell those products to local and international brands. The ready made dresses this company mainly works on includes jeans pants, cardigans, polo shirt, T-shirt and trousers. Recently they have started making kids items which are also gaining huge popularity. Their business includes manufacturing and packing the readymade garments, marketing those products and branding. So far they have achieved huge success and they are doing a great business.\n\nI would define their success basically in three ways. First, the expansion of the company is quite remarkable. They initially had a small factory and an office room with not more than 10-12 employees. This was probably not more than 6 years ago and in the next few years, they have become one of the largest readymade garments in our area. They now employ more than  4-5 hundred employees and have 7-8 offices in different locations. Second, their revenue must have gone higher than any other similar company in our area. They are doing better and bigger business and that has made it possible for the owners to become successful in this sector. Finally, the brand popularity of this company is quite enviable. They have been able to maintain the quality of their product and that has made them one of the most popular brands in our area."

    "Answer": "Paris is a metropolitan city. A good number of shops and cafes are available here. But in line with them, some small companies are also growing. Bullario is one of them and the company owns a small shop which is expert in producing handmade gift items.\n\nBullario is a specialist on selling handmade attractive gift items. The company is small but its products are really handsome and lucrative. Besides, pricing is not an issue with them. They sell different types of show pieces, wax-made statues, handmade flowers, flower vases, and many other items for regular use. Besides, the items are also could be used for presenting to someone. Bullario initially emerged as an online business platform but with the gradual development and its demands of products, it has taken the shape of a real-life business organisation though small in size. Bullario currently operates in Paris only and it also plans for expanding the business in some other cities shortly.\n\nI was seeking a small gift item for my niece and searched for a suitable place nearby my location in Paris. Suddenly I saw a page on social networking site, facebook, about such an online store that sells the things I need. Then I browsed their website and came to know that they have both online and physical stores. Since the shop was near my residence, I planned for a visit. I was amazed by their collection of items. Despite being a very small shop, they arranged for diversified items. The collection and variety of items were really adorable. I picked a couple of small gift items and show pieces to present my niece. I talked with the owner of the shop and came to know about different important information about the shop.  \n\nBullario is mostly a small shop and deals in diversified gift items mostly. The most important matter is that majority of the items are handmade and definitely with care. Some of the items are imported from different parts of the world. The business is doing very well only for its attention to the quality. The refund policy of this company is also admirable. If the purchased products are in good condition, they do not hesitate to refund the money. Besides, the company also provides a provision to replace or exchange the products with any other products and adjust the pricing issues. This is really a helpful feature from this company whereas I had some bitter experience in replacing purchased goods from some large shops and superstores. But the scenario was completely opposite here. They were highly cordial in such matters.   \n\nThis is a successful company from many aspects. As far as I know from the owner that the demands of the products are increasing gradually. As a result, they are making more profits and planning to expand the business. They have been maintaining the product quality and are also aware of their rights and responsibilities towards the customers. They do not bargain with the customers and sells the products at a fixed price. But they provide some off to the majority of the products round the year. Besides, they have a smart marketing strategy. It does not follow the conventional methods of marketing rather relies on the digital marketing. Consequently, within a short time, Bullario has drawn the attention of many of its existing customers. Therefore, I think this is a successful company and in the long run, it will grow more."

    "Answer": "Life is a great journey and in our life, we are bound to experience new things almost every day. Experiences we have in our teenage years often shape our future personality and perspective of life. As a teenager, I have had many experiences and many of them are quite positive and remarkable. For this cue card topic, I would like to describe one such positive experience that I had when I was fifteen years old.\n\nIn my early teenage years, I had to struggle a lot to cope with the changes – both physical and psychological; (may be most of the teenagers go through this phase!). When I turned to my 15th year, I was already having a different view of the world and most of my struggling was almost gone. My parents and my younger brother helped me a lot to overcome these teenage complexities. I started feeling the benefits and responsibilities of growing up and I was learning many new things including the importance of family bonding and the necessity of utilising the time properly. I was very happy to be able to eliminate my sufferings and psychological issues. I was in my grade 9 at that time and my father wanted me to take some serious and important extra-curricular activities. He discussed the importance of such activities and asked me what attracts me besides collecting stamps and playing football. I told him that I would be interested in joining a local philanthropic society that mostly helps the deprived children and homeless people. My father was quite surprised to hear that and finally appreciated my decision and arranged my involvement with this society. I was with this society that worked for less privileged children and poor people in our area. I had been an active member of this society for about two years until my family had to move to a new city.\n\nThese two years were incredibly positive years for me. I had no idea how talented many poor kids were and how few small bits of help could assist the poor people to change their fates until I got involved with this society. We had our limitations and could not do everything for those less fortunate people and children but the little we did was showing a remarkable progress. We had been able to send many children to government funded schools and many of those kids showed outstanding performance. Until I worked with those unfortunate children, I had no idea that many of them had a better experience of life than we had! That was a very a shocking yet a positive experience for me. I learned many things from my involvement with this society that I would never have learned from anywhere else.\n\nThis is fairly an outstanding experience for me as it had shaped my future character and vision of life. Now I feel quite proud that I had decided to work for those less privileged segment of the society and had spent times to do something better for them. I also thank my father who is a great person and a great mentor for letting me join this philanthropic society. He actually allowed me to start a new journey in my life that had a great impact in my later life."

    "Answer": "Passing the childhood in a village was the greatest blessing for me. In fact, I received my first positive experience from that place located in Peshawar, Pakistan. I helped a dog to be free from a trap set by the hunters.\n\nThe event took many years ago; when I was a teenager. I used to play with my friends near the jungle. A good number of people went into the jungle to hunt wild animals. So, they used different types of traps to catch the animals. On a day, I found a dog was screaming and I went nearer to that animal. The left leg of the dog was entrapped with the trap and also the bone was broken for the pressure created by the trap. I removed the trap and took the dog to a hospital in the locality. Actually, there were no veterinary institutions nearby and one the other side the dog was having serious pain. It was the positive experience for me.      \n\nI was a teenager at the time of the event. Being a village, most of the cases, we all passed our times in out of home activities. I used to be the part of a group of teenagers. All of us played different games and sports in the evening in the local field. Besides, each of the boys was wild and wicked. So, I can say that the teenage was the best time of my life. But the experience with the ill-fated dog was a memorable one for me. I have never done such a good task before. Rather, I have participated in many mischievous activities with my friends. Sometimes, I had to endure pressure from my parents for participating in such activities. But this was a quite different experience for me.    \n\nWe were playing some sort of local outdoor sports and running was the key feature for the sport. So, I ran and hide inside the jungle with two of my friends. Suddenly, we heard a noise and started seeking the source of the noise. Gradually, we discovered that a dog was entrapped in a trap and it was unable to shout loud. It might have lost all of its strengths to shout. So, I asked my friends to assist me in freeing the dog. One of them denied that he was unable to touch a dog. So, I took the help from the other one. It was not possible for me to remove the dog’s leg from the strong trap. After removing it from the trap, we took it to the hospital. The dog’s left leg was broken into two pieces.\n\nIt was a positive experience for me. In fact, for the first time, I did a positive work. The doctor cared for the dog and praised me and my friend for bringing it to the hospital. All the other activities I took part in were mischievous and also were aimed to harm anyone or to damage anything. This was the only task so far that was to save something. Considering the issue, it was really a positive one for me. After that experience, I felt a different sort of satisfaction inside my mind. Hence, I tried to do increase the number of such activities."

    "Answer": "Thanks for the opportunity you gave me to talk about this topic. Actually, I am doing my post graduation in a university now and I worked in a local Web design and Hosting company for about one year after I finished my graduation. I would like to talk about this job experience I have. In fact, this is the only paid job I have ever done so far.\n\nI joined this company as a junior executive and when I left the job I was working as an Executive officer. As the company business was related to website designing, hosting and networking related services and I was an executive there but not a designer or programmer, my main responsibility was to promote their services, managing existing clients and giving some technical feedbacks over phone and email.\n\nI learned about this job from an online job portal and their advertisement stated that fresh graduates could apply. I went through their other job requirements and it was a good match for me. I applied online and in a few days, I was called for the interview. After two weeks they gave me a call and asked me whether I wanted to join their company or not. I accepted their offer and joined this company in earlier January 2014.\n\nI did this job for about a year as I remember leaving this job in the early February of 2015. After I got enrolled in my MBA, I found it very difficult to manage my time both for the office and classes. I had to decide and I preferred to pay full attention to my studies and left the job.\n\nMy experience in this company was very pleasant. Indeed, I learned a lot about the client communicating, handling their queries and complaints, promoting different packages this web hosting company offered and the technologies related to the designing and hosting. Besides, I was lucky to work with some great colleagues including many designers, developers and system administrators. The working environment was very friendly and I never felt stressed working there. The professional knowledge and experience I gained from my first job in this company would be very important in my career, I hope.\n\nI had to work many long hours and that’s something I often had to struggle with especially after I got enrolled in my Master's degree. I remember working till midnight sometimes when there were issues related to a server or hosting. Sometimes deadlines were very frequent for various clients and I had to work without any day-off. Apart from these negative aspects, I enjoyed my job and the salary was very satisfactory. I even got two salary increments in one year and that was very encouraging for me."

    "Answer": "Managing a part-time job is really difficult in Athens. But luckily I got the job of an assistant to the library executive at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. The job paid me well. In fact, it was the source of income for me to meet my daily needs and expenses.\n\nThe job was about assisting the library executive in all possible ways regarding the dissemination of books and other reading materials. In fact, I was the key person to be reached before getting any book issued from the library. The job was a perfect one for me. I was looking a suitable job during the entire graduation period but could not manage one. Later, I got this job as I applied for it. But getting the job was really troublesome for me. I had to beat some other candidates to get the job though I could not perform the duties for a long time.\n\nSince I had been seeking a suitable part-time job to be self-reliant, I used to explore on all the possible job seeking websites including the one of my university. I heard that my university often recruits its students in some part-time activities and pays sufficient amount of money. So, I was seeking such a suitable option. I was undergraduate and it was not possible for me to get involved into any full-time activities. After waiting for a long time, I found the job advertisement on the university website and applied for it. Considering my backgrounds and academic result, they allowed me to appear in the written test. I passed the exam and appeared for the final approach. With my skills and smartness, I managed to get the job finally by beating five other candidates.   \n\nIt is sad that I could not have the job for a long time. I had graduated in the next semester and applied for a full-time job. So, I served as the assistant for next four to five months after getting the job. The time was really interesting and enjoyable. I used to attend the library from 4.00 pm and stayed there for 8.00 pm. I was assigned for a four-hour duty in a day. But the remuneration that I received in exchange for my service was worth my hard work. I was able to manage all my expenses and stopped taking financial assistance from my family. Though they are solvent enough to carry expenses of five other girls like me, but it was my self-respect that did not allow me to take any more support from family. By the same time, dad was happy with such a decision. In fact, he always wanted to see me in a position where I could live with respect.   \n\nAt present, I miss the job much. I have joined a multinational company here in Athens after the graduation and the facilities are far better than that of my university library. But still, I miss the days of a few months ago when I started for the library at 3.30 pm and reached there before my duty hours began. Often I read books on varied interest and discussed the themes and plots with the library executive. He was a gentleman indeed. Besides, when I bought some small presents for my mum and dad, they also became happy and their smile gave me much pleasure. Actually, those were the golden days of my life. I really miss the days!"

    "Answer": "I have visited numerous places and cities both in my home country and abroad but the most vibrant and colourful place, in my opinion, is Vernazza which is a small town in northwestern Italy. I still feel the animated landscape and bright scenic beauty I witnessed there. This place was so colourful that every photo we took there, later looked like a beautiful postcard. Lemon yellow, pastel pink and sea green façades dot the coastline of Vernazza and the four other scenic waterfront villages that made up Cinque Terre was something I will never forget. I have never seen such beauty in colours and I can compare it only with the colours of a garden full of flowers and butterflies.\n\nI went to Vernazza as part of our tour plan to visit the famous tourist destinations in Italy. We had an initial plan to stay there for few hours but the loveliness of Vernazza simply took our heart away and we stayed there for a couple of days.\n\nThe most significant thing I did there was appreciating the beauty and rich colourfulness of this place. I ate my lunch and dinner in a local restaurant and had a boat trip in the evening. We did fishing as it is one of the truest fishing villages on the Italian Riviera. I also visited Doria Castle, Chapel of Santa Marta and   Vernazza's beach.\n\nIt would be quite hard to express the beauty and vibrant colours of this town. Lively mixtures of colours were everywhere. The houses were coloured in red, yellow, pink, green and lemon-yellow while the water around the town was deep blue. In the hilly area, there were green trees and flowers of different colours. The boats in the bay and water were coloured with all the colours of the rainbow and the sky was deep blue.  I have never seen any place as colourful as this town was."

The entire locality was thriving with colour.\n\nI went to visit the Jewish living quarters in Balat in Istanbul. Istanbul is a historical country and also the is the gateway to Europe and Asia while Balat is located in the European part. This is a nicely located area and mostly lived by the Jewish community. The streets and houses are colourful. The most interesting fact about the locality is that you will find the spread of colour everywhere in the area. All of the houses are made with the traditional materials but they look bright and attractive for the colour selection. The streets and building structures also were attractive to look at.  \n\nI am a student of undergraduate and love to travel. In fact, travelling is my hobby. As part of my hobby, I made a short trip to Istanbul. It was the last summer when I went there. Unfortunately, I was unable to manage more time to complete the tour. I had to come back home after spending two days in the country. I made the plan to visit the entire land and enjoy the tourist spots. This is the bridge between Asia and Europe. And thus there are a large number of things are there to see and enjoy. The country has been ruled by numerous rulers and almost all of them have their own relics. There are some special places to pay a visit. So, I planned to visit all the suitable places in the country. But with a phone call from dad made me cut my trip short. He wanted me to be at home as soon as I could for dealing with some emergencies.\n\nIn this small tour, I have visited some of the noteworthy places and Balat was one of them. I came into the locality and was amazed at its colour. The area is a bit more populated than the other residential areas. Street foods here were delicious and I loved the people I met here. Besides, I visited the Palace of Blachernae which is located nearby of the locality. Walking down the streets was enjoyable. The sun was just over the head and it was the midday when I entered into Balat. I passed about one hour in the area and moved in different parts. I took my lunch from a street shop and it was really delicious. After visiting the area, I returned to my hotel.  \n\nThe place was colourful and it was really impressive. I think there might be some festivals were going on at that moment. As a different national I was unable to speak with them in their local language. Though some of them spoke English with me, I was unable to discover the meaning the statements in most of the cases. Whatever the reason was, I think the colour is the representation of their mind. There were numerous colours – red, white, purple, blue, dark shades and more. Besides, the dresses of the people were colourful too. It appeared to me that they love colours and thus they made the colourful look everywhere. It was really a pleasant experience for me."

    "Answer": "Well, I have so many important events in my life and I can remember many of them. However, I would like to talk about the most auspicious ceremony of my life, my marriage, which happened in December 2012.\n\nWhen I got married, I was 26 years old. Since I belong to a traditional and orthodox Hindu family, it's more or less like a religious and family festival. We invited most of our friends and relatives and the celebrations started three days prior to the event. We had to arrange all the amenities to the guests who came by; such as hotels to stay, food and drinking arrangements and we had to make sure all of them were pretty satisfied. However, another biggest challenge I faced was the raising of the fund for the occasion. Fortunately, everything went well and the day is still a wonderful experience to think about.\n\nOn the flip side, the greatest reason why that day is rather important is because, ever since then, I witnessed a dramatic change in the way I live. I had to become more responsible and after all, I got someone to share my life together. I gradually realised, the biggest part in life is to become shoulders and shade, to someone who is important to us, especially at the time of crisis. I would like to conclude by saying that now I am happily living with my parents, wife and son, and my marriage was the first significant step towards this journey."

    "Answer": "Living in a suburban area was interesting for me as the life was peaceful and quiet. But moving to the Cape Town, the centre of the city, from Salt River was also hopeful for me that I would get chances of meeting with new people and environment.\n\nIt was a memorable event for me. I was a teenage then but still can remember the entire event. We shifted in the city of Cape Town as my dad was transferred with his responsibilities in the city. And it was hard for him to move in the city every day and come back home again to prepare for the next day office. So, he planned to shift in the city with the family to avoid the unnecessary hassles of travelling. Besides, the communication system was not so developed in those days as it is now.\n\nI was 13 when we moved to the city. Before moving to the city my dad had to travel for around 16/17 miles each way to reach his office. In fact, he was the manager for a local clothing manufacturer. So, he had to be busy with his office and manage everything his authority wanted him to do. As a teenager, I was unable to understand the entire issue but felt comfortable that I will get something special. In fact, I did not have any friends of my age. Either they were senior to me or junior. So, it was a horrible situation for me. Attending the school was the only matter of relief. But attending a new school in a new place was more interesting to me.  \n\nMy family moved into Cape Town from Salt River. It was a massive change in my family. My dad had been living in Salt River since his early age but now he shifted to another place with us. It was also enjoyable to all the other family members. But by the same time, we were feeling sad to leave this place. Initially, dad planned to sell the house we lived in but later he changed his decision. We rented an apartment in Cape Town and also planned to visit this suburban house whenever we could manage time. It was a heart twisting event for all of us, especially my dad. We have been living in the area for a long time and now we are moving in a different place\n\nThis was an important event in my life in many aspects. Firstly, I had to assist in shifting activities with my other family members. Besides, I got completely an unfamiliar environment and it was just the opposite as I thought. The event was important in another sense that it taught me some special learnings in my life. I came to know about a different type of lifestyle. Besides, I got admitted in a new school which was interesting indeed. I found that the life that I lived in Salt River was not the similar with the living in Cape Town. The entire city was crowded with people and vehicles. But the environment was the opposite. I was not used to with the city life rather the life of Salt River was comfortable to me. But now I am used to with the city life while the suburban life appears dull and boring. So, I think this was an important event for me."

    "Answer": "Reading is a great habit and not everyone has it. I am lucky in that regards that I have formed the habit of reading different types of books and magazines from an early age. Now, this is a pleasant moment for me to describe my habit of reading a magazine and my favourite magazine. Besides reading books, I also love reading magazines. They contain a good number of interesting elements to entertain the readers.\n\nI regularly read the Reader’s Digest of Australia and this is the best magazine in my opinion. This is a standard magazine to go through and pass the leisure hours. Besides, this is an enriched magazine that deals with some specific issues and themes. As a result, the readers of the magazine come to know about a lot of things from a single place. It tells the readers about health, shopping, travelling, living at homes and more other issues.\n\nActually, there is no exact information that which types of people read the magazine. But it is anticipated that the Australians who have crossed their 30s are highly interested in this Reader’s Digest. In fact, they are the people who need some real-life information to deal with ‘situations’ in their life. So, as part of their external needs, they take help from the magazine. The Home Living section of the magazine is particularly useful for the women. They can get ideas to improve their living conditions at home. Besides, they also can generate newer ideas and implementation them on decorating their respective households through the earned knowledge from the magazine. This is also a great resource for the adventurers. The travelling section deals with the travels and adventures and they also provide numerous valuable tips and tricks to be applied in trips.    \n\nThe magazine is extremely popular in Australia and it has gained popularity by its own capacity. The magazine comes with a nice cover and size, Besides, this is also available in online. So, if someone misses the printed version of the magazine, this is easier to read the articles and stories on its online version. Further, the magazine is popular for some other reasons. This is a special type of magazine that deals with most necessary issues for each of the Australians. It deals with recipes, health, travel, home living and other important aspects of human life. Since we all are to remain busy with our professional engagement, it really becomes hard to take decisions on any important issues, and this is the only magazine that comes with necessary articles, tips and other ways to help in dealing with the situations. Hence, it is a popular magazine.  \n\nI love to read books, particularly novels. But this is the only magazine that has attracted my attention because it comes with the necessary things in need. I also love to travel but managing days for a long travel is really tougher for me. With the ideas of travelling tips, I plan for some small trips nearby. Besides, my wife also loves to read the recipe section. She, in fact, loves to learn cooking using the recipes provide on the magazine. Both of us read the magazine and have subscribed to it. Now, it appears that if I had not read the magazine, my life could have been incomplete in some sense. I am really fond of this magazine."

    "Answer": "The magazine I often read is \"Medical Technology\". People who are medical laboratory technicians love to read this magazine. It's a monthly magazine. It is quite popular in Hong Kong. Almost every registered medical laboratory technician read this magazine regularly.\n\nThe magazine not only offers the basic knowledge in how to process human samples accurately but also publishes the latest news regarding new technologies. I have gained a lot of knowledge by reading this magazine. For example, I didn't know how to identify white cells under a microscope. After reading the magazine in 2013, I found it was not a problem for me to identify different kinds of white cells during work. Also, the magazine helps me catch up with the new technology. In February, I read that people in the University of New Castle invented a new technology to do the mitochondrial donation. All the information in the magazines is useful for my work. I can broaden my eyes, and improve my skills quickly.\n\nI know this is now a magazine that would attract mass people, yet I think many of their articles are quite helpful for ordinary citizens without any specialised knowledge in medical technology. The way this magazine emphasise the needs for living a healthy life would definitely benefit mass people. As a professional in the healthcare industry, I love this magazine and it is quite helpful for me."

    "Answer": "I haven’t thought about this in years. Erm, I did play games inside quite a lot as a child, everything from board games like snakes and ladders to hide and seek, but that was when I was a bit older. However, I think probably one of my favourite games – or things to play with at least – was when I was really little. Maybe about four? Let me tell you all about it.\n\nThe game involved playing with a set of simple, pale wooden bricks. I’d had these for as long as I could remember, there were maybe fifty or so differently sized rectangular (cuboid) and square (cube) blocks of wood, and they were stored in a dark green canvas duffle bag which had a white rope handle. I don’t know what the wood type was, but it was pale and they were quite light, so I could manage them even with my tiny hands. The bricks provided me with hours of creativity and fun, even though they don’t sound at all promising. From an early age, I’d toddle over to the bag, find a spot on the floor at home, and just upturn all the bricks in a messy pile on the floor. The ‘game’ was simply to build things. Sometimes I might make a tower as high as I could before it toppled over. Other times I’d create creatures or whole worlds with different bricks perhaps representing a different building or animal. I just used my imagination, the bricks could be absolutely anything I wanted.\n\nPlaying with bricks sounds like it might be a solitary activity. It’s true, sometimes I did just play on my own, absorbed in my own thoughts. However, sometimes I’d play with my sister too, and together we would create our own universe which we might control, or at least interact with. If friends came around we could work together to construct more complex creations. A tower might be built even higher with two minds at work trying to fathom out how to make it stable. Or we would develop each other’s ideas in the way that only small children with boundless imaginations can do. We had no limits to our creativity, and we were so small at that age that everything we saw was new and unexpected, so it was just as easy to imagine a goat as a dinosaur – both were equally unfamiliar in my world, so why not have dragons and unicorns too? It is amazing what a little rectangle of wood can represent if you have an open mind, and believe everything is possible!\n\nWhy did I enjoy it? Thinking back I just remember feeling content and absorbed with this game. I suppose when you are so small, maybe four years old or thereabouts, there isn’t much you get to control in life. However, with this game, I could do whatever I wanted and in my imagination travel wherever I pleased. It was something I could do with other playmates too – though I wonder how co-operative we really were at that age. I also can still remember the sense of satisfaction of building an enormous tower of bricks that was even taller than me… and then the seemingly endless joy of knocking it all down again and watching the many bricks scatter across in all directions! I don’t think I’ve ever felt quite so powerful since!\n\nI don’t remember exactly what age I was when I outgrew playing with such simple bricks, but I do feel a bit nostalgic when I look back at that time. Nowadays children’s construction kits are much more sophisticated, with models coming with instructions on how they should be built. I wonder if we have lost a little there, a construction kit with a picture showing how the finished model is ‘supposed’ to look, might help you build a replica of an existing building perhaps, but your imagination might use the same materials to create a whole new world!  I know which I would prefer to do…"

    "Answer": "I actually don't play indoor games nowadays because I don't have enough free time. These days whenever I get free time I like to do reading and cooking. But I miss my childhood days when playing indoor games were so desirable and fascinating.  \n\nThe indoor game that I used to play when I was a child was a dumb charade! I played this game with my parents. We used to play this game on weekends mostly. Especially when my parents had free time as both of them were very busy with their works.\n\nI enjoyed this game very much because we used to play in 2 teams. One member of each team has to make different gestures or do some movements and other team members have to guess it. As a child, that was a great challenge for me. I had to make the right gesture to help my partner understand what I was trying to say. On the other hand, we had to perform really good to beat the opponent team. As I played with my parents and close family members, I loved their companionship. The game required a bit if psychological effort and brainstorming while it was so challenging and enthralling.\n\nI really enjoyed this indoor game than any other indoor games I played at that time. At the end of each game, a chocolate pack was given as a gift and that made the game more challenging and competitive. Some of my very fond memories of my family members were rooted in this game. I still remember my mother making some funny gestures to let my father understand what she was trying to mean. My mother’s lovely face, funny gesture and loud laughter made me cherish this game more than any other one. Sometimes it was very relaxing for us to take part in this game and I guess my parents also liked to play this game with me as they found that I enjoyed it a lot."

    "Answer": "I am not much interested in participating in outdoor games and sports since my childhood. Rather the indoor games attracted me most than any other forms of games and sports. I was fond of the 'hide and seek' at my home when I was a child. I am happy to have the opportunity to describe the event here.\n\nHide and seek was a very popular indoor game in our days and in fact, this is still a popular indoor game among the kids of today in different parts of the country. In this game, someone needed to hide while one of the players had to seek out the hiding kids. This was really an interesting game and it continued until the last one of the players was discovered by the seeker. The game really gave us pure entertainment and we started playing the game in the evening.\n\nI used to play the game at my residence. In fact, it was a large two-storied building in a corner in Mumbai. In those days, most of the buildings were large in size and shape. Besides, there were ample spaces inside each room. So, we used to hide in corners of the rooms. Besides, there were many other places to hide and it was really hard for the seeker to seek out all the players. The seeker had to seek us inside each of the rooms. The game turned more interesting when the seeker asked us all to know about the hideout of the remaining players but we did not disclose the places. So, the seeker had to seek around the house but when he failed and surrendered, the hiding children would come out. Then he had to start seeking again as he could not be successful in his term. So he had to serve as the seeker again.  \n\nI used to play the game with my cousins and siblings. In fact, we had a moderately large group to play the game. There are 12 or 13 members – I cannot exactly remember as I was a kid of seven or eight then when we played the game. Some of the adults also took part in the game. With their participation, the game would turn more interesting as they hide in places beyond our imagination. Later, we also started hiding in the places but kept that secret. But the seeker knew some of the usual places and he easily could discover them. So, each of the days, we started inventing some special places. As I said before, the house we lived in had huge spaces to hide and it really was difficult to reach all the places for the seeker. The seeker used to find us under the bed, or from the corner of the room, behind the curtain etc. But it was hard to discover the special places like in the bathroom or inside the wardrobe etc.    \n\nI enjoyed the game for many reasons. It was the only source of recreation for me and other players. In fact, we had to follow some hard and fast rules and regulations in our days. Parents were strict on some issues and did not allow us to play out of the home. Considering all the aspects, the kids of our joint family started the hide and seek. We all waited eagerly for the evening to start the game. It gave us immense pleasure. But the evening was bad for the seeker as the role was to find out everyone. We all laughed at his misery when he had to serve twice or thrice in a single term. Really the game was an outstanding one for us all."

    "Answer": "In my childhood, my aim was to become a renowned doctor but due to the rise in merit list for admission I could not enter into a medical college. I got admission in Bachelor in Pharmacy and now I am working as a Pharmacist.  I would love to study Medical books, more specifically Psychiatry, if I get an opportunity.\n\nPsychiatry is very vast subject. It is not only the knowledge of mental illness, it highlights how we can enhance our intellectual capabilities. Variation in mood put a strong impact on personality and business. In my opinion, in the modern age, every person has some symptoms of psychiatric illness. If we have a brief knowledge of these attitudes we can manage the people who are having bad attitudes and they are working in our surroundings. A new subject of psychiatry is Emotion control, it emphasises who we can make ourselves happy and relaxed by just keeping our brain cool.\n\nAnother aspect of this study will be early prevention and diagnosis. If we detect psychiatric disease at the time of its start then the result of its cure will be great. Mental illness destroys the families and economics of the patients. By preventing these diseases before commencement we can improve the society and don’t let any disaster to happen. In short, our brain controls all the activities of our body and emotions control the brain. The Psychiatrist controls the whole human machinery by just controlling the emotions. Considering the advantages the knowledge this subject offers, I would love to study it with passion and great interest."

    "Answer": "I am a student of science background though I wanted to study arts once. But due to the pressure from my parents, I could not explore the subjects of arts, especially history. So, if I have any option to study more in future, I would like to study history, to be more particular, it is ancient history.\n\nHistory is the science of time. It describes the past and also informs us about the eras and living of the people. It appears to me that ancient history is the subject which describes the most wanted events of the time. How people passed their days, how their living was, war and peace, social status etc. In fact, ancient history is the subject that tells the stories of ancient days. It is the root to know the civilisation and modern days. By living in a modern day, it is really tough to come to know about the past histories unless someone is gone through the ancient history texts.\n\nAncient history is the subject that mostly deals with the emergence of civilisation. Actually, the earth is old enough now to remember its past days and events. A large number of nations and states have emerged while many of them are no longer existing in the present time. They have been forgotten as well with the passage of time. Besides, there are many ancient structures available in different parts of the world but still, some of them are mysteries to human. For instance, the mysteries of Pyramids in Egypt have not been revealed completely. The Mesopotamian civilisation, its emergence, contribution to the modern history, how people were ruled and their response to the government and systems and more other issues. The subject also discusses the relation of the state to the neighbouring states and national and international policies, strategies and law and order in the society.    \n\nThe benefits are huge. First of all, the subject will make the reader as an expert about ancient time. History is really an interesting subject to explore and once you will get interested in it, you will be unable to get distracted from the subject. Besides, ancient history has some stories that will enrich the knowledge of the readers. Treatment of different disease was really a surprise as they did not have the modern medicines with them. They used to diagnose diseases, pains and other physical disorders and cured them with the help of nature and even some the methods are still prevailing in the modern medical science. So, if the knowledge could be revealed. It would be beneficial for everyone to deal with physical disorders. Further, the people of the ancient times are pioneers for many of the modern activities which also will enrich the realm of knowledge.   \n\nWhen I was a kid of sixth or seventh grade, I had a subject on ancient history. The subject dealt with the ancient things and happenings of the world. So, I was greatly interested in the subject. But later, I had to give that up due to studying with science. I failed to get any more taste of the history as my academic activities changed to a great extent with the dealing of physics, biology and chemistry. But now I feel that I should have read the ancient history. In fact, I miss the subject very much. Hence, if I get an opportunity, I will study the subject in future."

    "Answer": "I remember Mr. Stuart who was an extraordinary teacher in my grade 7. He taught us Botany when I was in grade 7. I was then around 11 years old.\n\nHe was a remarkable teacher in terms of his teaching style and personality. He was quite elegant and distinctive in his dressing style and had a very charming and smiling face. While most of the other teachers sparked their tough personality, Mr. Stuart was very friendly and amiable. He was very punctual about the classes and I have never seen him missed a class! He reached the classrooms 5 minutes prior to the schedule and waited for the clock to tick the hours. He then recapped the lessons he taught last day and then asked us to question him. Only then he moved on to the new lectures. He told us lots of stories and those were all related to our study. He had been a successful teacher to reach the heart of the students. While we hated some of our teachers for their personality sometimes, I don’t think there was a single student in our class who did not love Mr. Stuart.\n\nBotany was not a subject I was interested in at that time. I was quite sure I might get the lowest number on this subject. However, this particular teacher and his brilliant way of teaching made me interested in this subject. I remember him because he was a good person, an excellent story teller and an ideal teacher for us. Because of his influence in the classroom, most of us did exceptionally well on this subject. I still think that we need more teachers like him in our schools who would be close friends to the students as well as great teachers and mentors."

    "Answer": "I have graduated from the University of Zimbabwe and still can remember those days clearly. Mr Steven King was my teacher at the university. He inspired me a lot and I have learnt a good number of real-life issues from him. I am really happy that I got the chance to describe him.\n\nMr King is highly educated and skillfully trained to teach the complex issues of biology. In fact, he was the professor of molecular biology at the university. But he was more than a teacher to me and all other of his students. His teaching method was dissimilar than the conventional form of teaching. He rarely used books on the class rather he loved to teach with using sheets. Sometimes, he prepared multimedia presentations as well. The classes when he played the video documentaries on various issues were really enjoyable.\n\nI was 17 and it was in the first year of my university. Fortunately, I got the chance to get admitted in my desired subject under science category. One of the course was named as the ‘Basics of Molecular Biology’ and Professor King was responsible for teaching us the course. His course outline was interesting. He took written exams only at the end of the semester while the other teachers took exams almost in every day of their class. In this age, it is really difficult to appear on exams on a daily basis. Comprehending the issue, Mr King took measures and won the hearts of his students. Besides, almost everyone of us scored good grades in the end of the semester on his course while the scores could not climb up in the other courses where we had to appear for tests frequently.\n\nIf I talk about the qualities of Mr King, firstly I should mention about his benevolence. He was very gentle in nature and never behaved badly with any of his students. Hence, he was the most popular teacher in the entire department. Besides, he also helped every student in their academic needs. In fact, he never refused to provide support to his students while the other teachers were not as much cooperative as like him. But on the other side, Mr King was strict on some issues. If he realised that any student is exploiting his flexibilities, he would take stern actions against them. As a result, everyone was careful about his studies. He also used to give me different useful advice to his students.       \n\nI have passed the university about nine years ago. But still, I can remember my mentor for some of his extraordinary qualities. He took care for each of the students like their father. Whenever the students (including me) needed any assistance, they moved to him and came out with a smiling face. I have also taken many of his supports and discovered that he was cordial indeed. He did all the necessary things for me and even wrote recommendation letters for my higher studies in a foreign university. Sometimes he offered coffee and chocolates which were really entertaining. The most important matter is that I have never seen such a devoted teacher in my entire life like Mr King. So, he is still in my memory and will stay there forever."

    "Answer": "The old person I admire most is my grandfather. To me, he is a hero, an ideal father, a benevolent person and a man of his honour. His name is Alexander Vladimir and he is around 75 years old now.\n\nWe live in a joint family and he is still the head of our family. Though he can’t manage every aspect of our family due to his age, yet he is still the decision maker for our family. I remember him from my early childhood when he used to play chess with me. He taught me many things including the value of honesty and punctuality. He bestowed me some of his great adventures in his life through stories and those stories are still inspiring for me.\n\nHe is a person of his word. He would not talk much but when he does it carries unparallel weights. He is a benevolent person as I have seen him helping many people in our locality. He was an educated person and a successful father as all of them are successful professionals and businessmen now. I revere my grandparents for his acute observation and great decisions. I like him so much that I want to become a person like him."

    "Answer": "Generally, meeting with old people is uninteresting as they talk unnecessarily. But my meeting with Mr Moe Myaing was really an interesting one. He is a retired army person and lives to my next door.\n\nMr Moe Myaing is passing his retired life now. He lives with his family in the opposite apartment of us in Yangon. He has been living in this apartment even before we started living here. He got his retirement in the early part of the year 2000 from the Myanmar Army as a colonel. Now he loves to recall the memories of his olden days. I find interest in talking with him. He owns a tall figure with a height of six feet and two inches. Besides, he looks strong even in his 70. And he is smart with an adventurer look. He loves to pass times in physical exercise and sports. In fact, he loves to take part in different sports in the local sporting club.  \n\nI first saw him in the corridor of the apartment block. He was having some sort of physical exercise. I knew that there is a retired colonel living in this apartment but did not have idea that he would be the man. In fact, I thought the colonel would be someone less old than him. Actually, I did not have idea that he is a bit older than I thought. But later, I discovered that he is an interesting man and knows how to attract people. Often he visits my dad at our home and we also are invited to his apartment in many occasions. Now, the relationship with him and his family with mine is excellent. Sometimes, I pass my leisure hours with him and listen to his heroic activities while he served in military.\n\nFirst of all, I like to appreciate his outspoken nature. He loves to speak straight. Besides, he tries to keep his promises and commitments. When he makes any promise, he is sure that he would be successful in keeping the promise. In fact, this is not his nature that without being confirmed, he makes any commitments. He is also brave and knows how to deal with difficult situations. I also like his spirit to continue physical activities in such an age. He can run faster than anyone else, takes part in sports like badminton and football. He also loves to swim. Mr Myaing took me to his swimming club and I was amazed at his performance of swimming. Further, he is a humble man and never behaves rudely with anyone. Controlling the anger is the other quality I see in him.\n\nI admire Mr Myaing for some particular reasons. He is a highly educated and trained person. Despite being an army, he knows how to deal with the civilians while a majority of the army personnel are unable to deal with the ordinary citizens. They have some ideas that they are someone superior and to be worshipped. But there are no such arrogances in this person. He is a nice guy and loves to gossip over a wide number of issues. He loves to meet with newer people and particularly with kids. I also have learnt many aspects from him which are really effective in my real-life situations. He has taught me the matters with great enthusiasm. For all such reasons, I admire him most."

    "Answer": "On my 24th birthday, my uncle gave me a laptop as a birthday gift and this was one of the best gifts I have ever received. My uncle, Mr Roger, was a prominent businessman and had a partnership business with my father. I was very fond of him and he usually gives me utilitarian and expensive gifts. On my 24th birthday, he gave me a Dell laptop and indeed it was an important and inspiring gift for me. It was about a year ago and the laptop is still in good shape. I had very basic knowledge in computers and after I got this laptop from my uncle, I learned many things and I am still learning and that is very important for my higher studies as well as my career I presume.\n\nThis laptop was a black colour thin laptop with 16-inch display. It was less than a Kilo and I carry it in my bag and often use it in my bed as well as on my study table. I usually spend 2-3 hours daily on my laptop and that is very helpful for me to learn the graphics designing and Auto CAD software I am currently working on. I connect to the internet using this laptop and I can communicate with my friends and relatives easily.\n\nThis gift is very important for me. It was a present from a person whom I like very much as well as it gives me the opportunity to communicate and learn new things. In today’s world, the knowledge of computing is really vital and that’s why it is an important gift for me. Moreover, the laptop was quite handy for me. I could search the internet, get help for my studies and learn many new things from my laptop. From the utilitarian point of view, this was a very useful device for many years to me."

    "Answer": "I love reading books. This is really a good habit and I am proud to have it. In fact, it was my grandpa who helped me developing the habit at an early age. With his wonderful gift on my birthday, I was inspired to reading many more books.\n\nMy grandpa died a couple of years ago. But he ignited the love for books on me. He presented me with the entire collection of Sherlock Holmes on my 12th birthday. In fact, it was the greatest gift ever I had in my life and it changed my life completely. Before having the present, I was like the other boys of my age, played with my local friends and passed my days with enjoyment. But once I got the Sherlock Holmes collection, my entire world changed. The books attracted me most than any other things.\n\nThere are six books of Sherlock Holmes in the collection. I loved the printing and illustrations of the books. There were 60 stories altogether in the books including the short stories as well. The hard-covered books won my heart for some reasons. First of all, I was not familiar with such books. In fact, I had never seen such books in my life before. The books looked fantastic and I fell in love with them at the first sight. I was amazed particularly for the book binding. They were very special and the leather cover made them look appealing. Even the books are still the same in shape and the leather remains spotless. I like the stamped front cover image where Sherlock Holmes is smoking a pipe with his usual hat.  \n\nI read the books for many times since I received them. But I was careful about the preservation of the books and for my cautious care, the books still look new. While reading the books, I developed a group of book readers. Often, many of them asked me to lend the Sherlock Holmes collection and I had lent them under certain conditions. I told them to be careful about the books while reading. I also told them to take the sole responsibilities if there are any damages found with the books during their reading. They agreed and carefully read the books. I also have read them for many times. Each of the times, every story appeared in a different dimension to me. I think it happened for my growing up with the age. There is no doubt that with the advancement of age, people become matured, it was similar for me. So, the stories were dissimilar to me in different times.  \n\nThe books are important to me for many reasons. They are extremely entertaining. I become amazed at the observation power of Sherlock Holmes in each of the stories. His skills to solve mysterious cases entertains me greatly. Further, I also get ideas about many unknown factors from the books. Often I try to follow the observation method of Sherlock Holmes in my real-life situations. But the most important thing about the books is that they have taught me to be a book lover. With Sherlock Holmes, I grew up and learnt to love books. As a result, now I have a huge library in my 20s. The library is enriched with a good number of books from local and international writers. In fact, the books are important to me as they have mentored me to read books of varied interests."

    "Answer": "My boyfriend, Bruno, recently has gifted me with a leather handbag and a box of chocolate marking the anniversary of our relationship. Those were really important gifts for me and I was amazed at the gift selection. In fact, he had never been so picky as he was this time. After receiving the gift, I was overwhelmed with joy that how much he cared for me. So, I thanked him a lot for the gifts. This is a nice cue card to answer. And it reminds me of the precious gift indeed.\n\nIt was a leather handbag and a moderate box filled with my favourite chocolates. The handbag was bought from a reputed handbag seller shop and was made with the finest leathers. It came with a nice belt to carry on the shoulder and several pockets too. So, I use the bag when I am attending any occasions. And I took the chocolates to my home and shared them with my siblings. They were happy too after having the chocolates. Every person of my family is aware of my relationship with Bruno, and they have accepted the matter positively. But if it was in some other families, I think the issue would not have been so easy to handle.    \n\nThe gifts were important to me for many reasons. First of all, it was the representation of caring for me from Bruno. I needed a handbag for myself and was planning to get that. Moreover, I love chocolates very much. Bruno got the things that I needed most. But I did not have a single word with him about the necessities. In fact, this is the way of expression of love to the dear ones. I am thankful to Bruno for the gifts and thus the gifts were important to me."

    "Answer": "One of my college friends once gave me a fish bowl with 5 gold fishes and that was an exceptional gift for me. Before that, I never had any kind of pet or aquarium at my home and gradually I started feeling the passion on such kind of hobbies. I was very sad to have it broken one day all of a sudden. Though I have bought another one with new fishes, but I still feel bad about my carelessness to have the fish bowl broken by me.\n\nThe fish bowl was given to me by Maria as to congratulate me for being the highest scorer in Mathematics in the second term exam in our college. She was the second best scorer!  I was a bit confused when she one day gave me the gift. However, I placed it near my study table and often looked at it. I bought some colourful stones and fish foods afterwards and the fishes became something very favourite to me. One day I was cleaning my room and don’t know how but I hit the bowl with a broom and it fell on the floor and was broken completely. The fishes were scattered in the room and immediately bought a jar and placed them in it.\n\nI felt very sad about this unexpected incidence. The fishes died in few hours and that made me even more depressed. The gifts are always inspiring and though I have brought another fish bowl with new fishes for it, it does not replace the old one I had. I felt really sad and when this happened, I thought it was completely my mistake and I should have been more careful about it. You know this was an instantaneous sad experience and I felt bad about it at that time. If that have been something I bought myself, I would not have felt that bad. The feeling was more bitter as it was a gift and the fishes died."

    "Answer": "Receiving presents in different occasions is always interesting but when the present get broken for carelessness, that is really heart breaking event for anyone. The same thing happened to me last month. I am feeling regret for my carelessness.\n\nI turned 19 in last month. Marking the day, I arranged for a birthday party at my place and invited some of my intimate friends and relatives. All of them arrived with nice presents and one of my friends gave me a magnificent small-sized flower vase. In fact, the flower vase was the most beautiful among them. I broke the vase accidentally and it was entirely my fault. I wanted to clean the vase but could not be so careful as it was needed to be. As a result, the vase fell to the ground and broke into pieces. And the accident took place a couple of days later I received the gift.   \n\nBeing a student it is tough indeed to arrange a birthday party by own. But I arranged it by my own initiative. I have spent a smart amount of money to arrange for the day. In fact, I started saving money to celebrate my birthday from the beginning of the year and found that the amount was very smart to hold it. Accordingly, I invited my guests to my home, ordered a birthday cake and made some traditional Spanish foods to entertain them. Everyone was happy with the foods and drinks while they also congratulated me to organise for such a nice birthday party. There were 15 people altogether including my family members – parents and younger brother. All of them enjoyed the event to the fullest extent.   \n\nThe sad event took place a couple of days later following the birthday. I wanted to place the flower vase in the living room. Due to my academic engagement, I was unable to check all the presents. So, I unpacked the presents one after another and found that the flower vase. But the accident took place when I went to place the vase at an appropriate positon in the living room. I was setting up the small table where I wanted to keep the vase. By my one hand I was pushing the table to place and on the other hand, I was holding the vase. Suddenly I stumbled and released the vase. It caused the vase to break into many pieces. At first, I could not understand what had happened. I was stumbled as the table moved aside with my force while moving it which made me imbalanced.\n\nI was shocked. In fact, I felt very sad with the event. It was the best present for me on my birthday. I was speechless. My heart broke. I sat on a chair and started thinking how it was done. My mum came and she also felt the same with me. I tried to reassemble the vase but it was of no use. It broke into pieces and it was impossible to assemble them. So, I had to throw the pieces as waste materials. I informed the event to my friend who gave it to me. She was also down hearing the event. I was to be blamed for the event. Finally, my friend presented me with another similar vase but still I miss that one."

    "Answer": "Actually, the most favourable colour for me is blue. I love the blue colour and I enjoy wearing blue coloured dresses or drive a blue car. One important reason why I like this colour is that it helps me to feel less stressed. It is the colour of the sky and the ocean and by looking at it, I remember the beauty of the Mother Planet.\n\nI think the colour is a part of cultures, and people can show their common habits by wearing their popular clothes which have different colours. For example, In Canada, Canadians are used to wearing red clothes in festivals, or Brazilians wear yellow colour on their national days. Moreover, colours can help us to distinct different careers. Doctors put on white coats, army personnel wear grey or nurses the blue one.\n\nFrom my perspective, I love this colour because firstly it helps me to have a better feeling about everything. For instance, when it comes to taking an exam, I wear a blue coloured shirt. I can better overcome my anxiety and I have more confidence if I wear my favourite colour. Another reason is that I think it is the only colour that helps to become more patient. Personally, as I use the blue colour, I can tolerate difficult situations in my life. So, this colour is the best choice for me due to its quality of increasing my self-confidence and patience to take burdens in difficult conditions."

    "Answer": "It is often said that blue is the warmest colour. I agree with the statement and the same appears to me as well. Yes, I like blue for some specific causes. Thank you for asking me the question and now I will describe it here. \n\nBlue is really a cool colour. The shade of blue is gentle, warm and creates a sense of calmness inside the mind. Further, the colour is also attractive. It is almost a perfect match for every situation if we consider it about clothing. Besides, the colour is also adorable in some other senses. Decorating with this colour makes the environment attractive and sometimes mysterious. It also brings a sense of satisfaction among the participants in different events where the colour is applied. Blue is also used in many other cases. The colour is a popular one among all types of people as it looks outstanding.  \n\nI like blue very much. I do not know if there are any exact reasons behind my preference to blue. But it appears to me that blue is everywhere. I find the blue shade wherever I look. The sky is blue. The sea water is also blue. It appears to me that the bluish shade is attractive and enjoyable in all seasons. I believe that blue is present in everywhere I see. The colour has something special within it. It is charming, it is special and particularly it has a different appeal to people. Besides, this is neither a dark nor a light colour rather has the perfect combination of the hues in it.  \n\nCostumes are used to make the appearance look beautiful. So, it is really important to select the right costumes for occasions or events. So, colours are really important for costumes. For instance, the majority of the people wear lighter colours while they would have been much prettier if they had worn darker colours. On the other side, the same thing happens for the opposite. Some people wear the darker but they would look better with lighter colours. But blue is completely different to describe. It matches with every complexion. Besides, this is a gorgeous colour to represent in different occasions regardless of seasons. Therefore, before picking costumes, one should be aware of the colours and its applications. \n\nBlue is my favourite colour. First of all, I have tried several colours but none of them matched with my complexion. But suddenly I realised that blue is suiting me than the other available colours. I am a bit darker than the average English people due to my parental genetics. So, it is hard for me to manage colours and finally, I settled on blue. It makes me look beautiful. Hence, this is my favourite colour."

    "Answer": "There are several joyful events in my life that I can summon up and out of those, I would like to talk about the day that my aunt was blessed with a little baby boy. This was an event that I still recall vibrantly.\n\nMy aunt gave birth of the baby in a hospital. When I saw a little prince was crying on my aunt's lap I was like skimming that time. I was very contented when I heard my aunt is going to give a birth a baby. I got very animated and I was counting days when this baby will come. I speculated and anticipated lots of things I would do with the baby. On the day when the baby came into the world was one of the happiest days of my life.\n\nI usually used to go look after my aunt. After I went to the hospital to see the price, I was very glad and attached by the event. I heard a baby's crying voice and then went near the baby. For the first time in my life, I felt a strong desire to kiss and hug him. He was so cute and adorable. He was trying to open his little eyes. I thanked God for this precious gift because my uncle and aunt had no children for many years even after their desperate tries. They gave birth to the baby after 15 years of their marriage.\n\nMy aunt asked me to hold him and kiss him. But I was so afraid to touch him as I thought that might hurt him. I felt I was in another world that time with the baby. After spending lots of time my parents were ready to go home but I denied returning home at night. I stayed in the hospital.  This was a thrilling event for me.\n\nNow I have a great attachment to him. His first word was my name. But that time he didn't know who exactly he is calling! So this was the event that I like the most. It gives me lots of happiness and that’s why I cherish this memory very much."

    "Answer": "Falling in love with the opposite gender is really an outstanding event in someone’s life. The similar thing happened to me, and I am going to describe the event here. It is really a matter of great pleasure for me to recall the memories. If I look back to my life, this is one of the most memorable events in my life. \n\nWhen I was the student of Tokyo University, I fell in love with a girl. She was my classmate. I fell in love with her from the very first sight. In fact, she was the most wonderful girl in the entire class (it appeared to me). I took my seat beside her and started taking. But I do not know what I talked about at that time. My sole intention was to impress her in some way so that I could make her convinced to fall for me. Gradually, I was successful and we got married after our graduation was completed. But the day when I proposed her will be the most memorable event of my life. \n\nMemories may fade but I think my memories with my wife will never fade. I can remember the things that I did to impress her very clearly. After completing my college days, I got the chance of admission at the university. Luckily I met with Momo Narumi. She also took her admission at the same department of mine. She was simply gorgeous. However, she was not aware of her beauty and maintained a very good relation with everyone in the class, unconditionally. I had a feeling for her from the very first day and started to communicate with her randomly. Gradually, I turned in to her best friend and I expressed my love to her. Initially, she was uncomfortable with the issue. But later, she realised the situation and on a very good day, agreed to be with me forever.  \n\nI proposed her on the first day of November. Before the proposal, I tried to make her feel that she was someone special to me. I was the student of the undergraduate level at Tokyo University and it was around 10 years ago. On that day, I proposed to Narumi to be my wife. In fact, I brought a ring for her to propose. Besides, I was also accompanied by some of my local and university friends on the day. But I did not allow her to understand that this would be such an event. I wanted to keep it as a surprise for her and accordingly made her surprised with the proposal. \n\nNarumi was a smart girl. She neither refused nor accepted me on the proposal day. So, I was a bit confused for her attitude. I perfectly did everything I needed to do. Besides, I also was a smart and intelligent student and belonged to a noble family. I discussed the issue with some of my cousins as well before the proposal. They all agreed and promised me to care for the familial troubles. But I was surprised with Narumi’s attitude. In fact, she was not ready for such a surprise. Later she told me that she understood about my feelings about her but she wanted to be clear about it. When she was assured that I really loved her, she agreed to be my life partner. It was the beginning and we are passing days with happiness now, got two kids and expecting for a better future. For all such reasons, the proposal event is memorable to me."

    "Answer": "Usually, I don’t like the politicians in our country as many of them take politics as their wealth accumulating source rather than working for the mass people. If I have to pick one to talk about, I would choose Baburam Bhattarai. From him, we, the Nepalese people, have much expectation for the nation’s development. We are often quite helpless in many social and national issues and politicians are there to show us ways. I also have the same optimistic thoughts about Baburam Bhattarai and consider him to be a great leader who works for ordinary people. He came from a small village of Gorkha district and became the prime minister of our country. This was not easy and he had to work hard and earn people's trust and love for that. \n\nIn today’s scenario of Nepalese politics, he has played a tremendous role to have an optimistic roadmap in front of the Nepalese nation. He is a visionary leader and a good politician. The contribution he has made towards making our country a developed one is something worth mentioning. I would very proudly tell others how he has sacrificed his time and efforts to do the betterment for our nations especially having a progress roadmap and many implementations of it. This is a very competitive era and the globalisation concept has made it mandatory for a nation to have a clear vision to go ahead. This leader did exactly the same. I revere him for his talent, vision and benevolent nature. He is not like other politicians who place money ahead of other important aspects of their responsibilities. \n\nI don’t like politics, at least the money-making and power-play politics that we have. I don’t have any desire to be a politician. I believe every citizen of a country has many things to contribute to the country and I want to do my best to help the country from my respective field. The main reason I am not interested in politics is that there is too much dirt in our politics and honesty and a sense of responsibility in our country are not the fundamental requirements to be a politician. Rather money, influence and power are the main things someone needs to become a leader. That's why I would stay far away from active politics. However, this does not mean that I would not be politically aware and informed.  \n\nI admire Baburam Bhattarai for his vision and fair play. He is a rare politician in our country and we need more visionary and honest leaders like him. We really need more honest leaders like him and I believe that someday we will have more honest leaders than corrupted ones and that is the day we young generation dream so dearly."

    "Answer": "Politics is really a matter of higher intelligence and honesty. Not everyone can be a politician, it requires a special set of skills and expertise. Mr Adrian Baruk is a Finnish legislator and politician. He is my favourite politician for some specific reasons. I will describe his features in brief now. \n\nAdrian Baruk is from one of the leading political parties in the country. He is a great politician and proudly owns a clean image. In fact, so far he has not got involved in illegal activities. Besides, he leads a simple life. He is mostly famous for his intelligence and sense of judgement. He played some important roles in the government when he was the Minister for defence. In fact, he improved the existing defence mechanism for Finland. Furthermore, he is a devoted political leader and loves his party more than any other thing. He has sacrificed the most important part of his life for his party.      \n\nHis party formed government twice in the last two decades. He was one of the most influential leaders. In his first term, he became the minister for trade and commerce, and in his second term, he became the minister of defence. He was successful in both of his terms and gained much popularity. In fact, he became popular even before his party came in government. He ran for the parliament and his electoral campaign brought him fame. He promised some specific things and he really kept his promise when he was in power. By the same time, he loves to lead a very simple life while the other ministers are seen a bit different in this case. They like to have a lavish lifestyle and typically lead their luxurious life which brings their downfall. But Mr Baruk is successful in this matter and entirely different from others.    \n\nDefinitely, I want to be like him. He is an honest legislator I have ever seen. He is accessible at any time of the day at his office or at his residence while there are some restrictions on meeting with the other politicians at their office and residences. He is an authentic patriot, took numerous decisions to protect the national interest. Furthermore, he has always proved his love for the nation and his party. He sacrificed his entire life for politics. In his personal life, he is a lawyer but hardly can manage time to practice. Besides, his family members are also considerate. They inspire him to continue his political duties. With the support of people of all strata, he is moving ahead. It would have been hard for him if he was not a man of good nature.   \n\nMr Baruk is not only my favourite politician, rather he is loved across the country. Most of the people love him as he never took any decision against the people. Often he had the chances to be dishonest but he did not so. As a result, he won the hearts of his people including me. I had the chance to meet him in person for one of my needs and found he was cordial enough and assisted in getting my work done. Later, he made a phone call to me know about the updates. I was amazed by the event that he really cared for me and my task despite being an ordinary citizen of his area. Since then, I am in his favour and he won my heart as well. I really like him much."

All of a sudden I got a phone call and I received it. It was very baffling initially as I was confused whether it was a recorded message or a real person was talking over the phone. I stopped the girl who was talking and asked her to talk very slowly. She was a marketing executing of some sort of electronic consumer selling office. She told her name Anne and I had real double whether that was her actual name or not!\n\nShe called me to talk about some promotional offers their company had announced. I told her that I was not interested but she was quite persistent not to let me drop the phone. I am quite acquainted with annoying marking and call centre phone calls and the type of scams they are after. I told that girl I would not be interested in buying anything and then she told me whether I would be interested in buying an electric shaver! That was quite a coincident because I was indeed in need of it. I was a bit confused about whether she had any sort of data about me or not. I asked her to contact me later but she started describing the features of their electric shaver!\n\nAfter a few minutes I cut the conversation all of a sudden and she tried to reach me a few more times but I did not pick up her call. So far that must have been a very typical phone conversation until I got a call from another number and she told me that she was one of my cousins who pretended to be a salesgirl and talk to me a few minutes earlier. I was quite amazed by the type of fun this cousin did with me. I had not talked to her for many years and that's why had not the slightest hint about her vocal. \n\nWe, later on, talked about our work, study and family and she asked me to visit her hometown someday. The conversation with this cousin (her name is Mirtha), especially when she pretended to be a salesgirl was quite funny and interesting in my opinion."

In fact, I just returned from college and heard the phone was ringing. So, I had to pick the phone and talked to him for the next half an hour.  \n\nMao Chaan is a smart boy. Currently, he is having his MA in International Affairs from a University in Japan. He will return to Cambodia in the next month. He takes care of my family as he is like a family member of my own. In fact, he was brought up with us. My parents brought him our home and he lived with us for a long time. My maternal aunt was sick after the birth of Chaan. She somehow became paralysed and could not move some of her body parts. So, my uncle, being a very busy man with his export and import business, asked my family to look after his child. So, immediately after his birth, Chaan started living with us like a family member of our own. My dad has helped him in all possible means and treats him like his own son. On the other side, Chaan is also respectful to my family members. \n\nThe conversation was about a lot of issues. Actually, Chaan wanted to know if my mum needed any specific things that he could bring from Japan for her. But since mum was unavailable right then, he asked me. I was surprised by such issues. Actually, I did not have any ideas about such things that my mum will be in need of. Besides, I also did not take part in any domestic activities. My mum takes care of things. So, I was unable to tell him about the necessities. Then he started mocking me. He did the mocking with me when he was with us. Such childish behave! He always tried to irritate me. When I was a kid, I got irritated with the slightest mocking but now the situation was different. \n\nThis was an interesting conversation for me. When Chaan failed to irritate me by recalling some of my childhood names, I started attacking him. I made him remember some of his evil deeds that are only known to me. Besides, his girlfriend is my best friend at university. I also threatened him to expose the truth of stealing foods and other stuff from the kitchen to make a picnic with the local boys and such other issues. In fact, Chaan was one of the wicked boys in the locality and used to create mischief in association with the other local boys. He also said that he will bring nothing for me when he returns. After exchanging such sweet threats, the situation was neutralised and I concluded the conversation. However, I really enjoyed the phone conversation with him."

    "Answer": "One of the historical figures that I admire the most would be Thomas Alva Edison. He was an American Inventors who lived at the end of the eighteenth century. It is said that Edison was one of the greatest inventors in the world, as he had found more than 1000 inventions during his time.\n \nOne of his greatest inventions would be the bulb light that we still use until today. In his biography, it was told that he had done almost 1000 experiences for the light and almost failed. But due to his persistence and strong determination, he finally found the bulb light. He was also the co-founder of the giant multinational company, General electric, which still exist until today. But the Company has transformed into a high-tech company which sells various kinds of products these days.  \n \nI personally like Edison, because of his great determination. During his time, scientists had limited equipment, as there was no computer, no calculator and people have limited access to the library.  But with that limitation, he never complained and gave up and continued to make some experiments. His story has motivated so many people all over the world and I believe that we should continue to pass the story to the young generation.\n \nOne of the fascinating things about Edison's life would be when he was a child. He was dropped out from school because his teacher believed that he was too stupid to learn. But thankfully he had a kind and loving mother who never gave up on him. She became Edison's teacher who always supported him in every situation. And in the end, Edison became one of the greatest inventors in history."

    "Answer": "The United States of America is a land of historical events. Besides, the country is also famous for some of its heroic sons. Abraham Lincoln is one of them. I am really glad that I got the opportunity to talk about him for the next few minutes. \n\nAbraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the USA. During his reign, the situations were unusual. The country went under some serious critical moments and the Civil War was one of them. Besides, there were some political and constitutional crises as well. But Lincoln controlled the situations in an efficient manner. It is Abraham Lincoln who abolished the slavery. Before the abolition of this system, racism was at its peak. Lincoln also did some other notable activities. He is the man who also made the federal government system stronger. The modern economy actually started its journey with the association of this President. In fact, many of the facilities we are enjoying today are the gift of this smart man.  \n\nAbraham Lincoln is famous for some specific reasons. First of all, he brought some positive changes in the society and as a direct consequence, we are enjoying the greatest benefits. He abolished slavery permanently from the country and ensured equal rights for all. He also reigned during the bloodiest war in the country. In fact, the Civil War was the most serious war in the history of the USA so far. People still remember him for his concepts to create a modern economy. Moral degradation was an important aspect in the then time. He ruled over the degradation. He also played role in the structural development of the country, established railroads, banks etc. He is also famous for his Gettysburg Address which is also quoted even in the present days. He wanted to unite the nation by all possible means and he was successful.       \n\nYes, I like him much. He is a historical figure in the history of the USA. He served the country as a great guardian and wanted to improve the existing norms and rules. Accordingly, a good number of changes took place in the country and we are bearing the legacy in the present days. It is really a matter of courage indeed to rule a nation during a bloody war and provide the right directives, working amid internal crisis and more. He also supervised and set strategies during the war so that the losses are minimal. All of his attempts were humane and he dreamt of a modern America. He emancipated the slavery in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution for the USA. In fact, this the greatest tasks he has ever done and for this reason, a majority of the US citizens like me hail him.    \n\nThe great figure in the history of the USA, Abraham Lincoln, was born in Kentucky in 1809. He had his schooling in Kentucky and Indiana but could not attend college for some issues. He moved to different states and worked as different professionals. He was popular among his fellowmen for his improved character, ethical feature etc. He ran for several terms to be a member of Illinois legislature and became a member of Whig Party. He also turned into Republican, studied law during his leisure hours and became a lawyer as well. After his tenure ended as a United State House of Representatives, he started his law practice. He became the 16th President of the country in 1861. He was assassinated, in fact, shot in the head on April 14, 1865, and breathed his last on the next day. This was the first assassination in the history of the USA."

    "Answer": "Thank you for the opportunity you gave me to talk about my family. To begin with, my family has got 6 members including me. My father, mother, elder brother and two younger sisters are the roots of my existence and I love them very much.\n\nTo start with my mother, she is the sweetest person and the kindest hearted woman I have ever seen. She is creative, helpful and loving in nature. She used to work as a teacher in a college but left it when my elder brother came to this world. She still runs a small boutique business besides taking great care of her family.\n\nMy father is the cornerstone of our family and works hard to win the bread for our family. He is a great mentor for all of us. He works in a large private company as a Vice President and he is a super dad, our inspiration and guide. He cares and loves all of us and holds himself responsible for our family's well-being. He loves travelling and that’s why we have travelled a lot with him. He is our hero, friend and mentor.\n\nMy elder brother (John) is an exemplary young person and a son every parent would dream to have. He is very talented and works in a Bank as a System Analyst. He has a creative soul and art is his passion despite his academic background in computer engineering. He is one of the best friends I have and he is my protector.\n\nMy younger sister (Kathy) is two years junior to me and she is my soul mate. She often rivals me but more often inspires me. She is my co-worker in everything unusual or out-of-the-routine thing I do. Sibling rivalry is something I have learned from her in a positive way. She would sometimes act as if she is my mother!\n\nThe little angel and the only mischievous family member is my youngest sister Poly. She is only 9 years old and she fills our home with her angelic smile. She is sometimes annoying and argues a lot but I can’t live without her. Toys, computer games and her pot plants hold her attention for the major part of the entire day. She loves to grab attention and complains about everyone just to grab some extra attention and affection.\n\nThe famous saying ‘Blood's thicker than water’ is quite true as I feel most comfortable and blessed being with my family members. I am sure I am lucky to have such a happy family where everyone has great contributions to help me become the person I am."

    "Answer": "Living without a family is really difficult. On the other sides, if there are more family members, it is also irritating as well, at least in my opinion. Hence, people often develop the idea that having a moderate family member is the best way to live happily in a family. They are correct in some senses. The family is the most fundamental concept of the human race and we are very closely connected with our family members.\n\nI live with my parents in Naples in Italy. I have four other family members. My dad, mum and two younger brothers and a sister. We are six altogether. This is a recent trend in Italy. But earlier, the trend of a family was completely different. People used to live in a joint family. At the same time, they had strong bonding with the other family members.  A similar thing is also found in the present days, but not frequently. My paternal and maternal uncles also share a solid bond with my family and often they visit us regardless of occasions.    \n\nMy dad has his own business of clothing. He owns a store in the local market. This is a moderate size shop and five employees work with him. On the other side, my mum is a school teacher. She is a teacher of Social Science in the school. She is one of the most popular teachers in her school and spends half of the day at the school. In fact, my mum is busier than my dad is. She is to take care of her school duties and at the same time, she is to care for the domestic chores. I am a university student and a graduating in History while my younger sister is in her secondary level and my brothers are in his ninth and seventh grade. We are a happy family but sometimes I have trouble with the youngers on some petty issues. Then my mum resolves them and has words with us all.    \n\nMy family members look like similar but they are a bit different in nature. My dad is a sincere person. He loves to take care for each of the family members. My mum is also similar to dad. She takes care of all the family members even in her busiest time of the day. I have seen that my dad does not respond to my emergencies always and remain busy with his works. While it is my mum who is always there for me whatever the emergencies are. My younger sister is careful about everything except her studies. She loves to spend time with her friends and continue chatting with them using the social media platforms. This is also the case for my brothers. But they are a bit addicted to video games. So, they mostly spend the time of the day with the Xbox. \n\nThe overall relationship with my family members is excellent. I love my family than any other thing in the world. My dad takes care of the entire family and bears almost all the expenses. In fact, he is the key wage earner for the family. My mum also earns but the amount is insignificant comparing to dad’s income. But both of them tries to keep us happy. I am trying to support to the family income and working as a part-timer at my dad’s business. Often my youngers demand some of their stuff to me and I try to buy the things for them with my earnings. As a result, the relations have become deeper with my youngers and me. I am proud of my happy family."

    "Answer": "Thank you a lot for this wonderful topic. I would be very much delighted to talk about my family. We have got a nuclear family and this is quite common for the people in the city areas to have the nuclear family. Rural areas still have many joint families but unfortunately, the tradition is changing rapidly.\n\nOur family has five members including me. My father works as a production manager (PM) in a car manufacturing company and my mum teaches English literature in a girl's school in our area. Both of them are very caring and sincere and they are quite friendly to us. I am the eldest son (...say, daughter, if you are a girl...) of my parents and I have got a sister who is 19 years old and a brother who has turned to 12 recently.\n\nMy sister's name is Jill and she is a very talented and inventive individual. She is the top scorer in her class and a creative artist. She can also dance and have won many local and national prizes for her outstanding performance in dance, debate, and art competitions. I love her very much and she is very fond of me. My younger brother, Kyle, is a very good soccer player and he likes to spend time with me. He often says that I am his best buddy and this is something I am really proud of. Since my parents had always been caring and friendly to us, I also wanted to be like them to my siblings. When Kyle is not at his school, he either plays soccer or hand out with his friends. At home, he mostly watches TV programmes, which we often do together, plays computer games or read books.\n\nI am 27 and I work in a private company for the last 3 years and a junior executive. I have now planned to continue my higher studies in a renowned foreign university.\n\nWe live in (... say the city and area name...). We have got a duplex villa and we love our house. We often have guests at our home and my mother cooks special menu whenever we have guests at our home. We eat our dinner together as a family and share our stories and events with our parents. My father often takes us outside to enjoy movies or to eat at a good restaurant. We enjoy this outing a lot and we look forward to going outside together. Usually, we do it twice in a month. I must say that I am very lucky and happy to have such a great family. I wish we live happily forever and our family tie always remains as intact as it is now.\n\nTo answer the question 'how important my family is to me'- I would say my family is the whole world to me. I love my parents and my siblings more than anything in this world. They have done (and still doing) a lot for me. My mother is the kindest person I have ever met and her sacrifices for us are unparalleled. As I have grown up now, I know how much it means to a father or a mother to have a child. As the firstborn among our siblings, I was my parent's whole world and the centre of their universe. Similarly, my family is the root of my very existence. I love them and would be ready to do anything and everything for them."

    "Answer": "Stuart is undoubtedly my best friend according to every definition I can fathom about the best buddy! He is 24 years old and a handsome fellow. His smile (both genuine and rouge one) is worth million dollars! Once I heard that if you can stay silent for a long time with a friend and yet feel comfortable being so, probably s/he is your best friend and that’s exactly what Stuart is.\n\nWe are friends for more than 7 years and I met him in my college days. After our friendship began, I enjoy his company from every perspective. He stays with me through thick and thin and is always the one person whom I can share anything and everything. He is a good listener and one of the most talented persons I have ever met. He never hesitates to tell me the truth in an unapologetically blunt manner and never hesitates to stop me when I am wrong!\n\nOur friendship started and remained so tight mostly because of our common interest. We often discuss the books we read, criticise the writings or movies we watch and praise a beautiful piece of artwork. We are both interested in computer games and we often play computer games together.\n\nThese days we are learning Spanish together and taking our graphics designing course together. Whenever I rent or download a movie, I invite him to watch it on my 3D TV. Apart from that, we are maintaining a blog together and that’s something we enjoy to a great extent.\n\nSometimes I share things with him that I cannot share with anyone else, and I get advice without being judged. This is the best part of our friendship and probably the main reasons our friendship is still intact and strong. He celebrates my successes genuinely, we know each other in and out and we can talk about everything no matter how nonsense it is."

    "Answer": "Working as an executive for a multinational corporation like Samsung is really interesting but sometimes boredom occupies me as well. But having a simple conversation with Natasha is encouraging indeed. Now I will describe the relationship with her, who happens to be my best friend. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to talk about my best friend. \n\nIt is really tough to manage a job here in Mumbai and this is more difficult for a woman like me. Fortunately, I managed the job and I am lucky to have it. I have been playing the role of an executive at Samsung India for the past three years. I met Natasha on the very first day of my office. She is a smart girl and gradually we discovered that we belong to the same batch but in different educational institutions. We also have some common friends as it is found on the social networking sites. Besides, she took her residence near the office which is a five-minutes’ walk from my home.     \n\nI joined the office in 2014 after experiencing a lot of challenges. In fact, getting the job was not easier. I had to attend several interviews and tests. Finally, I was chosen for the post when I was able to demonstrate my skills and expertise for the position I applied for. Later, I came to know that Natasha also joined at the same time. Besides, she also had her desk opposite of mine. With some small chats, we started our friendship. Gradually, the friendship turned into deeper and she became my best friend. Recently, we have started moving to the office together. Often we exchange our lunch and help each other to prepare presentations and more other official tasks. Most of the times, we love to watch movies at our homes on the off days. \n\nWhen we are at the office, we work as a team. In fact, the authority has made us a team based on our mutual relationship. But sometimes we also have to experience some disagreement over different issues. We make decisions based on logic and then agree to the disagreement. Further, we together make plans to be implemented by the authority, check the sales reports, take care of the other reporting issues etc. But in most of the cases, I am responsible for the preparation of the presentation with newer ideas to be implemented in the market while she is responsible for presenting them before the authority in the meeting. We are doing well and growing together. Recently, both of us have been promoted to the senior executive of the corporation for our outstanding performance. \n\nNatasha is my best friend. In fact, she is an intelligent girl and made me too. Before meeting with her, I was not that much smart as I am today. In each and every aspect, she helped me and taught me the things I need to learn in handling real-life aspects. Before entering the job of an executive, she was in a sales team and learnt about the professional life. Accordingly, she has set her goals and also helped me a lot to set mine. I am, really glad that to have her as my friend. Moreover, with the passage of time, we started sharing our sorrows and joys and the friendship of us also touched our families. Now both the families are quite familiar and maintaining a healthy social relation like us."

I must say I am thankful to you for the opportunity you have given me to talk about my best friend Erik.\n\nI believe friends make our life more meaningful and enjoyable. And some mates step forward to teach us how special they are in our life. Erik is such a friend and I consider him my best buddy.\n\nI know him from my school days. We went school together, played football in the evening, stood should to shoulder in adversity, shared our meals, helped each other in our studies and over the time, we became the birds of a feather. We still are inseparable and find comfort even in our silence, which accordingly to many a symbol of a great bond.\n\nWe have recently finished our graduation - I am from Science major while Eric is from Arts. We love to talk about our personal issues; he is the only person I can share absolutely anything and everything. We often play chess, enjoy movies, visit different places, we debate on our political differences and share our thoughts about our career plans. There are times when he advise me how to deal with obstacles and stresses and he often says that \"hole tight, buddy, every cloud has a silver lining.\n\nBest friends always stick together and become more like brothers than friends. I am absolutely convinced that Erik has already proven that he will support me in any way possible and help me out from any grave situation. He is the kind of a friend someone can have only once or twice in life. No doubt his influence in my life is paramount and he will always be my best friend."

    "Answer": "I am quite proud to have a family where I have got a talented brother, a renowned architect uncle, a genius sister who is an aspiring programmer and a father who is my hero in life. So it would be fairly tough to select a single person from my family with whom I would like to work with. Well, among my family members I would like to work with my brother David, I presume.\n\nDavid is senior to me by 3 years and is a really brilliant young person I have ever met. He is working in a big architect company where he designs modern houses and building. The main reason I would choose him to work with is because of my interest in architectural design and my brother’s being a great mentor.\n\nHe is a gifted and hard working person who would someday become a great architect for sure. He is amiable and friendly. He has always been my protector and the great teacher in my life. The list would be countless if I want to mention the things I have learned from him. He is a tall and handsome person and a voracious reader who always reads or works. I sometimes think in amazement how a single person could be so skilled and well-informed in so many arenas. Mathematics, physics, sports, history, geography, art, chess, astronomy, literature… you name it and he is a master in it.\n\nCertainly, I have worked with him before, but that was not something professional, but kind of personal projects. He and I built a remote controlled boat when I was in the school and I learned how determination can bring success from the experience I gathered from this project. We failed several times to build the motorboat out of some ordinary tools and equipment we had at home. At a time I got depressed but he was so determined that I could not quite. Apart from that, we did many other things together like participating in charity and voluntary work in our community, building a flying saucer toy, to solve numerous math problems etc.\n\nWell, the main reason I would like to work with his is because of his patience and my interest in his profession. He never loses his concentration and temper. No matter how stupid and wrong I am, he will always guide me to the right direction. He is talented and I will definitely learn new approaches to solve a problem. He is a great teacher for me and I am sure there is none with whom I would be as close as I would be with him. Another important reason I would like to work with him is because of his work area. As I said he is a promising architect and I would like to know more about the type of works he does."

    "Answer": "Working with family members is really interesting if they are intelligent, smart and offer you support. But the issue of adjustment is also another important aspect to consider. I would be happy to have a chance to work with Mr Stanley, who is also my paternal uncle.\n\nMr Stanley Johnson is a great engineer and has participated in a good number of local and international projects. In fact, his contributions are really outstanding with the projects. He is a bit extraordinary intelligent and can analyse any issues perfectly. His sense of timing and sincerity to work is really adorable. Working with him is a great option to learn a lot of things. In his personal life, he is a bit introvert. He likes to pass lonely moments. I have rarely seen him in participating in any social gathering. But if it is about any work or project, he is found in the leading position.\n\nMr Johnson is the younger brother of my dad. After completing his engineering education, he had to remain inactive for around three years. He was trying to improve his academic knowledge by his personal attempt. So, he did not apply for any job and instead passed his time for research and other relevant activities. But to do so, he had to sacrifice some special things in his life. He is a very busy man and even cannot manage time to maintain his daily routine. So, he has recruited a personal secretary to manage everything. As an individual, he is generous and loves to help people. But due to his shyness, he does not appear public. He loves to work secretly and thus he is not focused much. On the other side, I have seen a fewer people like him with the sense of extraordinary intelligence.\n\nUnfortunately, I did not have the chance to work with him before. In fact, I want to work as an intern under his directives. I am also pursuing engineering. So, I think if I could work with uncle Johnson, it would be highly beneficial to me. He is a man of letters and thus he could be able to teach me the exact things I need to learn to be a successful engineer in all terms. In my university, the courses are taught well but I need a deeper learning. So, if I could work with him, it would be easier for me to learn all the basics and earn the necessary skill.\n\nI have a large family and almost all the adult members are reputed in their respective arenas. But I want to be with uncle Johnson for some specific reasons. First of all, he is a skilled engineer and has huge experience to deal with real-life challenges. But my other family members are not as much skilled like him. Furthermore, when he talks with someone, he tries to make the things clearer to his listeners with plenty of examples. As a result, there are fewer ambiguities with the issues. So, when I will be working with him, he will teach me from his real-life knowledge and experience. Hence, I will get the precise and accurate information on things and issues I need to deal with while completing my engineering. Based on all the fact, I want to work with uncle Johnson."

    "Answer": "It’s true, children can do the funniest things. Sometimes it seems a bit unfair to laugh at their antics because they are maybe doing exactly what it is we’d like to be able to do, but unfortunately, as adults, we probably wouldn’t get away with! They can have a curiosity about the world that makes them notice and draw attention to things we probably would politely ignore, which can be embarrassing but can be funny too.  However, I have a particular example in mind. I’m going to tell you all about it. I wasn’t even there to witness it, but it is such a good example that I heard so much about I feel like I was there, so I’m sure it must count!\n\n\nThe child in question is called Beth, and she is the daughter of a good friend of mine. She is grown up now and studying at a university.  She would hate for me to remind her of this instance, but it still makes me laugh to recall it. The situation was that she had a birthday party aged about six or seven years old I think. It was a very special occasion, her mum (my friend) had made a lovely cake, and all the children at the party were in some sort of fancy dress – probably as fairies or something similar, in any event, it was a very BIG occasion. Beth, the little girl, was utterly delighted to find herself the centre of attention, and enjoyed party food and games, having her friends around her and no doubt getting lots of presents too! The only sad thing was that for some reason, her grandparents weren’t able to go to the party. To make sure they didn’t miss out, my friend made a great effort to get hold of a camcorder (an old fashioned video filming device - modern mobile phones that you can film with just didn’t exist back then) and recorded the whole occasion so it could be played back later.\n\nThe following weekend, the grandparents gathered at their daughter and granddaughter’s home and settled down to watch the video together. The video was a great success, capturing the sense of occasion wonderfully. All the adults oohed and aahed at the film, enjoying reliving the party enormously. However, after about five minutes, Beth suddenly got really annoyed. She was jealous about all the time they were spending watching the television when she felt they should be spending the time interacting with her! Apparently, she put on a real strop! She stomped across the living room and stood directly in front of the TV screen so no-one could see the picture anymore. She folded her arms across her chest and defiantly exclaimed ‘I don’t understand why you are wasting time watching a picture of me on the television, when I’m the real me and you could be playing with the real me instead!’\n\nIt was hilarious, she was so cross, and so jealous of her own picture.  Everybody laughed. I did too, when I heard all about it later as my friend relayed the story to me over the phone. It is true that Beth, the little girl was maybe a bit spoilt to expect to always be the centre of attention, and it’s ironic that she was so annoyed when actually it was a film all about her celebrating her birthday that they were viewing anyway.  Even so, there is a little part of me that thinks, funny as the story is, she was right in a way.  Sometimes it is important to live in the moment, and we can spend too much time seeing life through a viewfinder on a camera or on a TV screen. What she did was still funny, it makes me smile now recalling it, and she will still cringe if we mention it to her now – but there was a lesson in there too somehow, if we choose to hear it..."

    "Answer": "Often, the aptitude of the children is far better than the intelligence level of some adults. My recent experience with a child proved the statement again. I was amazed at a sudden event when a child took a special decision and that was quite surprising and funny in a way. I am really happy to describe the event here.\n\nThis was the child of one of my colleagues. I was invited to his place for the first time on the occasion of the birthday of his only child. The child, Ethan, turned three on that day. But he was a bit different than most of the average children, at least that was my impression. Each of his activities was different than the other kids of his age. He is smart and intelligent. His smart answers and questions really made me puzzled. I am a regular visitor and admirer of this kid. So, he has a close relation with me and has granted me as one of his family members. As a result, he behaves spontaneously with me and I also become perplexed with his matured sense of thoughts and speeches.\n\nThe event took place in the middle of the last week. His parents had arranged a party and I was also invited there. The party began in the evening and continued till 10 pm. There were around 20 guests in the party and all of them were mostly relatives. I was, on the other hand, from outside of his family. But they did not make me feel so. I was quite comfortable with them. In fact, my relation with my colleague turned in to an informal one as I live just the opposite of his residence. We are in fact neighbours and been living there for past three years. So, I and my wife have become close associates of their family. The child did the special thing once it received the gift from me. I presented him with a large water gun to play. In fact, Ethan was fond of guns and thus he desired for the gun to me and I kept the promise.\n\nEthan sees many television shows and knows that the guns are used to shoot. So, he started playing with the gun. He refilled the gun with water and pointed that to the guests and shoot them with water. He wanted to have fun and did so. But finally, when the water was finished and his parents did not allow him to refill with water, he shot them. When he shot his dad, the dad fell on the ground. When he shot his mother, she also fell in the ground as if she died. He was surprised. He could not decide what to do. So, he shot himself and fell beside his mother until they stopped pretending to be dead.\n\nThe entire event was hilarious and made me laugh with all other invited guests. In fact, the kid was highly intelligent and his gestures made me laugh. He was confused what to do when he shot his parents. So, finding no other options left, he killed himself. In fact, it proves his guiltiness but the representation of the situation was really interesting that everyone could not stop laughing with this scenario. Despite the issue being a grave one, it was a kind of comical event. So, I laughed with my heart. In fact, it was the rapid decision making skill of the child and the implementation of the decision without any hesitation was the key element of the genuine laughter."

    "Answer": "How do you begin to define success? This is really hard, because does it mean a company that makes lots of money? Does it mean a company that produces something innovative or is just very well known? Does it mean a company that makes the world a better place through discovering a medical cure or paying fair wages to staff in countries where they are often exploited? I don’t know, it could mean any or all of the above! Even so, I can think of one company that I know well, and which is meaningful to me, and which started from nothing to become a chain, so I think that makes it more than successful enough to talk about in my eyes, even though you may never have heard of it.\n\nThe company is called Bravissimo. I used to live in a town called Leamington Spa, which is in Warwickshire in the UK, and that is where the company started out, and where its head office is still based. Essentially, they are ‘just’ a lingerie retailer i.e. they sell women’s underwear, but what makes them unusual, is that they cater exclusively for erm, well let’s say, the more ‘curvaceous’ figure. They sell bras in larger D+ cup sizes. The company was born from one woman’s frustration at being unable to find a decent comfortable and well-fitting bra when her body shape changed during pregnancy. She and a friend decided they couldn’t be alone in struggling to get quality lingerie appropriate for their size, so they went on a small business course, and with the help of a modest grant set up their own company sourcing and selling lingerie by mail order.\n\nThey really hit on a great idea, there was at that time a definite gap in the market supplying bras to women with a fuller figure. The business quickly took off, they really cared about their product, and they had a local ethos. Employing local people at their warehouse, and then when they opened their first shop in Leamington spa they paid good wages and trained staff well. For seemingly the first time, women could go to a specialist shop, be measured without embarrassment by a knowledgeable and sympathetic member of staff and try on as many bras as they wanted to in an unhurried and relaxed environment. Speaking as someone who had real difficulty getting underwear that fitted me, it was just brilliant when they started up. The week the shop opened I went in to be measured and came out with a completely different bra size from the one I’d been wearing before. I threw away all my old underwear, and for the first time ever felt comfortable, confident and quite literally supported with my wonderful new bras!\n\nUnsurprisingly, the company quickly expanded, they now have 21 stores across the UK and also sell via mail order and online. From just the two of them who started up they now employ over 700 people. They have also expanded their range to sell clothing under the Pepperberry brand from 2011. The company is successful because they had a really good idea, and the tenacity to see it through. The founders have expanded carefully, and it is a profitable business. I believe because the company was set up by women who had a real passion for their business, they deliver quality with understanding. I love that the entrepreneurs were two women, and they have an attention to detail which makes for great customer service and generates customer loyalty. I have many friends who, like me, having discovered Bravissimo would now never go anywhere else. The company has grown, but the quality and personal service have remained the same as at the outset.\n\nBecause the company started from a need and an idea, rather than setting out to make a fortune, I believe it has an internal integrity. Many women customers want to get rid of their old underwear once they have found a size and product that suits them better. Therefore, Bravissimo has set up recycling banks in their shops so bras in good condition, but that no longer fit their original owner, can be sent to parts of the world where having a bra is seen as an unaffordable luxury yet is much needed to help protect women and girls. It’s hard to imagine from the comfort of the UK, but in some countries, underwear gives protection by demonstrating status and showing that a woman or girl, must therefore have someone who cares for her and protects her. Having a decent bra isn’t just about being more comfortable, it might actually protect these women from sexual assault – startling, but true.\n\nSo I think Bravissimo is successful however you look at it. It started with a great idea for a product where there was a gap in the market. It is good at what it does, and it provides something that certainly makes my life a lot easier. The company is financially profitable, and it employs many people in good working conditions. If my memory serves me right I think it may even have been awarded a prize for being the local employer of the year at one time. It has retained a personal feel. I know plenty of people who shop online with them, and yet I’ve never met anyone who has a bad word to say about the company. In this day and age, that degree of customer loyalty is a rare thing indeed. Hurrah for Bravissimo, long may they continue!"

    "Answer": "A good number of successful companies are available across the world but none of them is as enriched as Microsoft Corporation. This is a software company and the software it produces is extremely popular. Mostly it produces the operating system for the end level users.  \n\nThe term Microsoft is derived from two words – microcomputer and software. The corporation is also known as MS as well. Dealing with technology, the company has reached the top of the success. Currently, it deals with a large number of technological issues including computer software, Windows operating system, software license, Microsoft Office suit and more others. In hardware aspect, the corporation produces video game consoles. This is now standing as one of the most precious and valuable companies of the world while it is also the largest software maker in the technological arena.    \n\nThe company is headquartered in the Redmond area under Washington. Now the company has a huge compound but the beginning was challenging for the entrepreneurs. The corporation was jointly founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Both of them tried to start something new for the end level computer users, especially the development of personal computer operating system. The initial system was MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) and gradually the DOS turned into the Windows that almost all the users are using around the world. With the gradual development, the entrepreneurs also gained fame and wealth. The rise of the corporation began after the 1990s. The co-founder Bill Gates is now one the richest person in the world while the corporation has also expanded its business in some other sectors.     \n\nMicrosoft Corporation mostly deals with technological issues. The majority of the personal computers in the world now run with Windows operating system. This is the greatest invention of this company. Besides, it has its association with some other corporate bodies and has bought Skype and LinkedIn – two of the most popular modes of virtual networking and communication. Besides, the company has some other arenas of interest like it has a share in video game industry. The corporation is skilled in producing computer software and sells them at a reasonable rate. It also comes up with some other services like mobile phones and digital service market. The computer also started producing personal computers for the users, tablet computers and more. Microsoft Office Suite is the most used software for computers and people use the software package to meet a wide number of their needs. \n\nI believe Microsoft Corporation is a very successful company so far after its initiation. In fact, it has no noteworthy competitors in the market. It has happened for its specially made software and their unique features. The company is successful in almost every term. The services are unique and the users are satisfied with the software quality. \n\nFurthermore, the corporation has always tried to bring the products in a user-friendly environment. Anyone can use the personal computers without experiencing any sort of troubles. Besides, the products are exceptionally simple and easy to use. But there are some complexities with some other operating system like Linux or Mac. So, I think this is a successful company and it is for the exceptional strategies."

    "Answer": "As soon as I looked at this topic, the place that popped up in my mind is the Great Barrier Reef. This is a dazzling place and it is surrounded by a lot of water. This is actually located in the Coral Sea in Queensland, Australia and I had been fortunate enough to visit this place last year.\n\nMy uncle lives in Australia and earlier last year, we went to visit his family. As part of our tour, we visited the Great Barrier Reef and it was a heavenly place that I would like to visit again someday. It is a famous place for the tour-lovers and we had a great time there.\n\nI learned about this place from the Discovery channel and it would be more than 5 years ago when I watched a documentary that portrayed the world’s largest coral reef. The remarkable documentary that focused the Great Barrier Reef presented it as a blessed place with the breathtaking beauty. It is a Natural Wonder of the world. \n\nWhen I witnessed this place, I was awestricken by the real beauty of it. This place was something out-of-the-world and as the largest coral reef with a spectacular view attracts a lot of tourists each year. The reef contains spectacular marine life and it comprised more than 3000 reef systems and coral cays and some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Initially, we had a plan to spend about 3-4 hours there but as soon as we reached there, we changed our mind. Finally, we spent 2 and half days and did many things which we enjoyed a lot. We did scuba diving, cruise ship tours, watched whales (this was, in fact, the first time I saw the whale), swam with many dolphins (probably the best experience for me) and enjoyed the local food. We took hundreds of pictures and many of them were magnificent. The sunset eve was a great experience for us and we enjoyed both the sunrise and sunset from a beach there and the blue and clean water was everywhere."

    "Answer": "I love to travel and if the place is nearby water, the enjoyment doubles for me. I have heard about the Cox’s Bazar sea beach in Bangladesh. In fact, this is the longest sea beach in the world. I have a plan to visit the beach when I can manage time.  \n\nI am an inhabitant of Afghanistan. Being a landlocked country, this is devoid of large water bodies. So, the thirst to meet with such large water bodies always haunts me. My recent google search for a nice destination inside Asia suggested about Cox’s Bazar. This is located in Bangladesh, one of the most populous south Asian countries. But the geographical condition has bestowed the country with plenty of blessings and the sea beach is one of them. This is a sandy beach stretching around 75 miles in the town of Cox’s Bazar and considered as one of the longest one in the world. This is a famous destination for its unbroken beach and slopes.  \n\nBefore making any trip, I try to gather the necessary information about the destination lest I do not fall in any unwanted troubles in the visiting spots. Earlier, I have gained some bitter experiences as I did not have ideas what to do in different places or how to deal with the situation. There are plenty of websites available which provide the best tips and tricks to travel across the world. Since I have been planning to make an annual trip in the Summer ahead, I was looking for a nice and suitable destination for me inside the Asian boundaries. Suddenly, the name of Cox’s Bazar appeared and then I came to know about it. Before the google search, I knew a little about the sea beach but now I have gained detail information about the entire locality. \n\nI have not been there before. In fact, I have not been in Bangladesh as well. So, there are no chances to visit the sea beach. But the natural beauties and attractive visiting spots have drawn my attention to the country, especially the sea beach. Besides, there are many other interesting places to see and enjoy. The country has a strong tourism industry. I also came to know about the special packages of visiting the places. A good number of tourist agencies arrange for tours there. So, being a part of such a tourist package would be an added advantage for me. Actually, I am planning to take the trip in the entire country.  \n\nCox’s Bazar sea beach is a magnificent place to visit. The sea beach is located in Chittagong division of the country and adjacent to the Industrial port of Chittagong. The name of the locality has been adopted after the name of the then officer of British East India Company, Hiram Cox. Earlier, it was used as a fishing port, in fact, it was a fishing town. But with the gradual change of time, the landscape was changed to attract visitors. Now a good number of visitor flock together in the sea beach every day. They enjoy the sunrise and sunset scenes, take a ride on different modern water vehicles and skies, enjoy the sea foods and participate in many more attractive activities. I have already started counting days for the trip."

    "Answer": "Music is a part of our culture, tradition and life. It plays an important role in refreshing our mind and soul and gives us inspirations to do something bigger and better. Music has its own charm and charismatic power to revitalise us. I often listen to music and one of the songs that I heard in my childhood is still one of my favourite songs. The title of this song is “Wind of Change”.  It is one of the greatest songs of all time by the Scorpion music band and as far as I recall it was released in the year 1991. The name of the album that had thing song is ‘Crazy World’. I actually own a CD of this music album.\n\nI heard this song on a radio for the first time. It was probably 1992 and I was only 7 or 8 years old then. After that, I have listened to this song several hundred times and I still love this song. ‘Wind of Change’ is considered as one of the best rock music of all time and it is a power ballad by the German music band ‘Scorpion’.\n\nThe band members of the Scorpion visited Moscow in 1989 and were inspired to write this song as a celebration of the glasnost of the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics), the end of the Cold War. This song speaks about the hope in a time of dense tension and possibility of war and casualty. This song represents the inner cry of people for peace and harmony.\n\nThis is one of the most widely listened songs in the world and alone in Germany more than 6 million copies of this song have been sold. In Germany, this song is remembered as the song of German reunification and a message of hope.\n\nThis song has a special meaning to me. It, on the one hand, reminds me my golden childhood and even today, on the other hand, instils hopes in me in the desperate and complex time. I love this song- it is simple yet profoundly powerful, inspires and motivates me and gives me hope. I often hum the first few lines of this song when I am tensed and the great lines like:\n\n\"Take me to the magic of the moment\nOn a glory night\nWhere the children of tomorrow share their dreams\nWith you and me...\"\n\nare still quite powerful and inspirational."

    "Answer": "Childhood memories often remain vivid in our mind for numerous reasons. They, in fact, create such an impression in mind that one cannot forget the memories even if they want. I am feeling nostalgic about my childhood now. \n\nThis is a song for the very young kids who are in their elementary schools. In fact, this is a nursery rhyme that has been created in different versions. I heard bot the rhyme and the song but the song was more impressive to me. Still, I remember the tone and each of the lines of the song. I cannot exactly remember where I heard the song but it appears to me that it was in the elementary school of mine in Chicago for the first time. I was admitted to the school to learn the basics and the teachers used to play the song in the class to make us familiar with the rhyme.  \n\nI was around three or four years old, I cannot remind exactly. In fact, the students of the nursery are no more than four in my city at present. So, I think I was almost the same then. It was the time for me to pass moments in different academic activities and come to know about the letters and words. Besides, I was also taught about many other things related to the beginning of my education. The nursery is the time when the kids learn the basics of their life. It starts with teaching some of the most necessary educative things which are required in the later phase of the education. It builds the base of education for each of the students. Without learning the basics in this stage, it is really difficult for each of the students to grow further.   \n\nThe song was about a sheep which is black in colour. It shares it wools with people. But the meaning of the song is still mysterious. Many of the schools believe that the song is a kind of protest against the heavy wool taxation of the Middle Age while some others are in the view that it is about a slave trade. But there are not strong historical evidence have been found so far against the claims. Further, there were some other controversies about the song which indicates that this all about racism. Besides, the rhyme has also been changed to some extent in the present days. As a result, this is now only the nursery rhyme that is played in the nursery classes in the form of a song as I heard back in my days.  \n\nWhen I was a kid, it was difficult for me to understand the meaning of the song. But now I know what it is all about. So, the pleasure is more severe now than it was in the past and in my childhood. I can see that a black sheep is distributing all of its production to the people. It has produced three bags of wool from its body. And now is keeping a share for its owner, one share for the dame, and the remaining one for the little boy living down the lane. I think each three has some sort of connections with this sheep and thus it is sacrificing its precious production to the surrounding people. The song really entertains me and teaches to be more willing to share my belongings."

    "Answer": "Well, this is an interesting topic to talk about. I can recall few such events when I did not like someone I was talking to or dealing with and yet I behaved very friendly and was quite amiable to this person. One such event that I recall very clearly occurred about one year ago when I visited one of my friends’ house.\n\nMy friend John invited me and Chris to his home for the dinner and we were very excited to meet his parents and siblings as we had never been invited by John to his home. On a Sunday evening, I went to Chris’s house and two of us then headed for John’s house. We live in the same neighbourhood so we walked to reach John’s place. On our way to his home, we bought a box of chocolate and a small gift for John’s younger brother David. This was the first time we were visiting John’s house though John has visited our house several times. It was always a mystery to us until we visited his house!!! \n\nAs soon as we reached John’s house we could understand why John felt uneasy to invite us. John’s father stays outside till late night and on that day he was not present at home even after John specifically requested him to stay and meet us. John’s mother was a bit rude (I am sorry to say so, but I do not know how to describe her using more polite words!!!). The only person who was friendly and good behaved was David, who was only 12 years old. After we gave the gift to David he was very happy and wanted to gossip with us and tell many stories from his school. However, her mother sent him to his room and rebuked him for something we could not understand at all. After that, John’s mother started interrogating us like a detective does to reveal secret information from a bunch of criminals. I felt quite uneasy and yet could not leave the place only because I cared about John. I felt terrible by the unfriendly behaviour and whimsical questions of John’s mother. It was quite tough and challenging for me to keep my usual calm and maintain my composer, and I noticed that Chris had turned red already as he does whenever he gets irritated. I talked to John’s mother very politely, gave as many answers as possible and showed our concern for her. I thought she would act differently as we were showing our utmost respect and sincerity for her and her family. She did not!!! After we finished the dinner (she was a terrible cook!) we did not wait any further and rushed to get back to our house.\n\n'What I did not like about that her?' Honestly, I had a soft corner about her as she was the mother of John. But I did not like anything about her except that she was the mother of two wonderful boys –John and David. She was rude, did not know how to talk politely to someone, asked us all the personal and irritating questions, did not know or did not care how to treat a guest and acted very funnily with her own kids. I am quite amiable to others, especially to guests or someone I meet. But when people forget to act at least moderately, I become very angry. Though I acted very respectfully to this woman, I was angry deep inside.\n\nThe main reason I acted very friendly with her was because she was the mother of my friend. I know how important it is for us to show our respects to our elderly – be it my parents or my friend’s parents or someone else. This is why I did not show my anger or disrespect to her for a single second. I tried to behave as politely as possible and so did my other friend Chris. I knew any disrespect and rude behaviour of us would only worsen the situation and John would be hurt. That’s why we behaved very cordially and maintained our equanimity."

    "Answer": "Being always friendly does never mean that the friendliness you are showing to will be the same from the opposite side. Such an event took place with me in last month after I went to attend an interview. I had to be friendly with a woman whom I could not like at all.\n\nIn December last, I went to attend a formal interview with a locally reputed organisation here in El Salvador. I applied for the job from a job seeking a website where they advertised for the post. Accordingly, I was selected and was asked to attend the interview. But I was displeased with the receptionist of the company. She was a very arrogant in nature and hardly provided any support to the attendee applicants for the post. I was asked to be at the office compound before 11 am and I did so. But the attitude of the receptionist made me think that I might have made some sort of mistakes being at the right time. \n\nInitially, I could not get her name or rather I would like to say - I did not try to know about her personal details. She was assigned, I assume, to welcome the applicants and show them the rooms for the written test against the post. She also was supposed to provide all the necessary supports to the applicants regarding the interview. But she sat at her desk with a displeasing attitude. Of course, she was a pretty girl with a cute smile but she reserved the smile for some of the officials, not for the ordinary employees. She looked beautiful with her business suit but I think she was a bit arrogant as well. Later, I came to know that she was Samantha by name and was the in-charge of the reception desk.  \n\nTo be frank, I could not like the person for some specific reasons. First of all, she was not supportive to the applicants at all. When the authority made the phone call to me, they told me that I will get all the necessary information and supports from the receptions desk if I need. \n\nAccordingly, I tried to get help about my seating arrangement. But she did not respond until I asked thrice to her. She did the same thing to everyone attended there for the interview. She pretended that the applicants cannot speak well and thus she is having a problem in listening to them. Further, when an applicant asked to drink a glass of water, she responded as if the man has done a serious crime. It was really shocking. For all such reasons, I did not like her. \n\nI had to be friendly with her as I was a stranger at the office. Moreover, I did not know if I could get the job or not. She was an official of the organisation and I was an outsider. Besides, it is not my nature to show hostility in the first appearance with someone as she did. In fact, I was not the same like her. I am different with some humane qualities which she lacked most. Hence, I tried to show friendliness to her as much possible. But she was just the opposite not with me but with everyone else present there for the interview."

    "Answer": "This is indeed an interesting topic to talk about. As soon as I looked at this candidate task card, several well-groomed people’s faces crossed my mind. But for this cue card topic, I would like to talk about my cousin Helen who, in my opinion, has the best dressing senses. As she is in the fashion industry, she dresses quite fashionably. However, she never wears something extravagant or offensive to the family members. \n\nHelen is my cousin and she is 3 years older than I am. She did her graduation in Fashion Technology and has been working in a reputed fashion house for the last 3 years. She had a distinguishing fashion sense from her childhood and she is always quite careful about the way she dresses.\n\nShe does not have any defined dressing preferences. She rather chose to dress based on the weather, temperature and the occasions or events she attends to. She is quite a beautiful lady with a great sense of humour and her distinctive dressing styles make her stay out-of-the-crowd. As far as I have seen her, she likes to wear comfortable dresses but those dresses always have the touch of some sort of fashionable designs. She mostly wears cotton and light dresses during the summer. In winter, she wears jeans, long overcoats and beautiful hats. Her preferences of shoes are quite remarkable and I seek her advice every time I need to purchase shoes for me or whenever I am confused what to wear in an occasion or a party. \n\nI believe expensive dresses do not always make someone fashionable or careful about the ways s/he dresses! Helen is a perfect example of a person who can reflect a positive fashion sense even in a very simple dress. She does not wear gaudy and very colourful dresses and I have hardly seen others complain about the way she maintains her fashion and grooming.  But you know there are always some people who like to comment about the ways other dresses, and I do not consider their remarks very important!!!\n\nI know her from my early childhood as she is my cousin. She is very close to me and she often visits our house. She lives in a different town now but she used to live in our neighbourhood. I went to her office twice and I was astonished seeing her working with many renowned fashion designers in our country.\n\nThe reason I preferred her as a well-groomed person for this cue card topic is because she always wears neat and clean dresses and never wears something that contradicts the conventional dress code of an event. She always gives the weather condition a priority while choosing her clothes. She will give people an aura of tranquillity and impression of a dandy person and this is quite unique about her. I have talked to her many times about fashion and costume, and in my opinion, she is quite knowledgeable about these aspects. She values the importance of traditional dresses and whenever she wears an exotic dress, she makes sure it does not look offensive to the family members or to others. I would say this is a great accomplishment for a fashion designer and a person who respects her own tradition and culture."

    "Answer": "In this present age, having a nice dress is really a necessary element to represent someone in a decent manner. I know a colleague of mine who dresses very well. Describing him in a few words would be difficult for me. \n\nI am a senior executive here in Bulgaria and working with an international NGO. I take care monitoring aspects for some the projects. My colleague, Mr David Johnson works with me in the same position. He is a tall-figured person with a stunning look. He loves to participate in outdoor sports and travelling is his another hobby. Besides, he is smart enough to deal with complex situations and brings the win for him. His analytical ability is adorable and also can take an instant decision about different project monitoring issues.    \n\nHe is a bit different than the other employees. Though we work in a very formal environment, we enjoy the flexibility regarding our dress code. We do not have any strict dress code but wearing formal dress is preferable. Mr Johnson is the only person who never comes with an informal dress at the office. Even if he is asked to attend any meeting in the weekend, he appears with a formal dress. He loves to wear the formal shirt, pant, suit and shoes. Once I asked him what his attires were in his residence. He replied that he remains causal at his home. But unluckily we could not see him in his casual dress. But he is a bit choosy about dress colour. He loves to wear the light colours than the dark. So, all of his suits and shirts are of lighter colour.   \n\nI first met him on the day of the interview with this organisation. I had been looking for a suitable job for me and applied for the position. There were two posts and lots of applicants. On the day of written tests, I met him at the conference room, where the exam was taken. Later, both of us were allowed for an oral test with some other applicants. Finally, we two got the job at the project. From the very first day, I have seen him in formal dress. He even never wears sandals at office lest his formal dress code become spoilt. In fact, this is the only person I have seen ever so obsessed with his formal attires. But by the same time, he is also adored for his sincerity with the dress code. He also has got an award for maintaining the formal attires round the year in the office. \n\nI had some conversations with him about his dress code. His reply on the issue made me amazed. He is really sincere in every issue related to his career and profession. Since an early age, he is sincere with all the duties and responsibilities he gets. Wearing a formal dress is the official order, but many of us do not comply with the order in the right manner. Some of us often come with a casual dress and they feel comfortable in such attires. But he is completely different. His pure and perfect sense of responsibility does not allow him to disobey the official dress code. Even when he and I go to field visit in different remote places, he is still formal with his dress. I think the sense of responsibility and sincerity makes him determined to follow all the rules and responsibilities. So, he dresses well always."

    "Answer": "Nothing is better than being in a really strong team.  By that, I mean one where everyone achieves more together than would have been possible as individuals.  You have trust in each other and support each other too.  Sadly, not all team work is like this, I’m sure it can’t just be me that has had some bad experiences of working with others when the communication has been terrible, workload inequitable, the experience miserable and outcomes disappointing.  However, when everything is right, a good team can make you feel invincible, and that is the sort of example I’m going to use today!\n\nI’ll tell you all about the team, when we got together, who was on it, what we did (I don’t think you’ll guess) and why I came to be part of the group in the first place.\n\nSo this team came together just a couple of months ago.  We were a group of about ten mismatched and unlikely individuals.  We were mixed men and women, different ethnic backgrounds, different ages, different levels of fitness and experience – which is relevant to what we were trying to do!  We came together almost entirely by chance.  Near to where I live, there was a 10km obstacle race. This involves running round a course, and negotiating various physical challenges en route.  To take part, you need to be in a team, because some of the obstacles are impossible without help.  So for example, you might all have to get over a 10 foot wall, or swim across a river.  Sometimes it’s a simple question of bravado – with the river you just have to be brave enough to jump into the freezing cold water, but other challenges – like the wall - can’t be done unless you trust your teammates to push you up and heave you over.  Think army assault course, and you may have some idea of what I mean!  A friend of mine had heard about a group that was happy to adopt the approach of ‘the more the merrier’ so we all signed up separately and met each other for the first time on the morning of the race!\n\nWhen we met up, at first we were all a bit apprehensive about what to expect.  We decided to put on face paint so we had a united identity, and then when the cry went off for the start, we all sped away together.  Fortunately, we very quickly got into a routine of helping each other out.  It turns out that doing a physical obstacle course together not only requires trust, but creates trust too. You have to clamber over each other, stand on someone’s back to get over an obstacle, or haul on someone’s hand or arm to help them over in return.  If you go first over an obstacle, then you have to help others behind you.  We got covered in mud, we nearly lost our shoes on the uneven terrain, and we all had many bruises on the way round.  However, we laughed almost the whole time, we supported and encouraged one another, and even though it took us nearly two hours to negotiate the whole course, the time flew by.  We can’t wait to do it all again next year!\n\nI just signed up for the challenge on a whim really, but I was so glad I did.  The people I met were fantastic, and we all achieved more than I’d have thought possible.  There is no way on earth I’d have got round that course on my own, but together every single one of us completed every obstacle, there were no tears or tantrums, and when we got our medal for finishing at the end, we were almost exploding with pride at our achievement.  Why did I become part of the team?  That was a question I asked myself as I drove towards the venue wondering what on earth I’d done as the enormity of the challenge hit me!  Afterwards, I was so pleased I had.  It was a happy accident, and proof that some of the best teams come from working together for a common goal with an open mind, an open heart and a sense of humour.  I think that would carry you through most challenges, you just have to keep positive and keep faith in the creativity and kindness of your fellow human beings!"

    "Answer": "During the 1990s, I was a student at Notre Dame International High School in Paris. At that time, I was the member of the school football team. I am really happy that you gave me the chance to recall my olden days of school. \n\nWe had a school football team. There were 15 players altogether though it takes 11 players to continue the game. Four extra players were there to support us in any needs. I was the midfielder in the team. The sport was not that much popular in the days when we practiced it on the school ground but now it is on the top of popularity. Besides, in our time, there were less football teams in the surrounding schools. We won some of the local awards after playing with the interschool competitions. I enjoyed the matches and still miss those days.    \n\nAmong the 15 players, not everyone could perform very well during the mathces. Often a few of them could not participate for some unwanted reasons. As a result, we had to rely on the extra players. The team coach, Mr. Adelard Victor was a great mentor for us. He taught almost all the available techniques to play a perfect football. Besides, the goal keeper, Anatole was another wonder for us. He was skilled in protecting the goal bar from the oppositions. But he failed to prevent almost half of the attacks from the opposition team. The striker, Florentin was really a unique player. Many of the opposition strikers could not stand before him. He was speedy and by the same time moved ahead with the ball by dodging the others. in fact, it only him for whom we achieved most of our victory.    \n\nAs a team, we played a huge number of matches. Since the sport did not get much popularity at that time, the matches were held with the schools of the same locality. Besides, the prizes were some cups and medals. But that was the greatest achievement for us on those days. I also achieved seven medals for my performance. But unfortunately, I could not be the best player in any of the matches. Often I moved with the ball near the goal post of the opposition team and passed it to the striker to make the goal. If we were lucky, we could have scored the goal. But in most cases, the opposition players defended us and we could not make the score.  \n\nThe rate of success for me individually was not outstanding. But I had to be a team player for some reasons. Each of the members of the team plays some specific roles. So, as per the roles, I executed my duties. In fact, without the participation of any team members, it was not possible for the team to bring the victories though they are less in number. Besides, with the participation of all the team members, a team moves ahead to success. Playing in a team is also enjoyable in many aspects. Therefore, I became a part of my school football team."

    "Answer": "Mr Robert is our neighbour who lives next to our house. In my opinion, he is a fashionable person. He works in a private bank and is around 34 years old. He has recently married the girl he had been engaged for more than 2 years and moved to our locality.\n\nI know him as he is my neighbour and often visits our house. He has been living in our locality ever since he got married. The first time he visited our house with his wife was the day we met. Since then we know each other and we often have conversations whenever we meet in our house, street or in the supermarket.\n\nHe usually wears formal dresses for his office which is a white shirt, and black suits. He likes black shoes and he has more than 20 pairs of shoes! He either wears a blue or red tie for the office and I have never seen him wear dresses that give a very casual impression in an office environment. Though he wears official dresses like other employees, he has an acute sense of fashion and style that makes him stay out-of-the-crowd. He always wears branded dresses and that makes him look quite handsome.When he is at home, he wears jeans and T-shirts. However, the T-shirts he wears are designed by his wife who is a talented artist. \n\nI find him quite fashionable as he follows the latest trends in fashion. He is fond of shopping and has a great sense of latest fashions. He always wears dresses that would comply with the occasions. His great personality, dandy dressing style, knowledge on latest fashion trends and amiable behaviours make him a likeable person.  As per several conversations, we have had, I know that he is a talented person. He told me that he likes to wear comfortable yet fashionable dresses as it keeps him motivated to work harder or concentrate on doing things he needs to do. He also believes that the way we dress reflects who we are and other people often judge us the way we appear in front of them.\n\nHe told me that some people find his shopping habit quite silly, but he likes to spend money on buying new clothes because it gives him a great pleasure. However, he also confessed that sometimes purchasing new dresses becomes quite addictive and he is very alert not to fall into this trap. The perfect way he dresses, the branded dresses he purchases and the sense of style he follows make him a fashionable man."

    "Answer": "Fashion always changes its shape based on situations and environment. But there are some people who are always trendy and look beautiful whatever they wear. And if they are models, they need to be careful about the fashion too much than the ordinary people. \n\nChampei Devi is a fashion model in Cambodia and she is extremely cautious about her fashion. In fact, she is the only fashion model in Poipet, Cambodia and always loves to wear the dresses of the latest design. She has been playing the role of a fashion model since her early age, and now has established herself as an influential model of the arena. Besides, she also takes part in some other commercials where she also exercised her fashion. I think she has a fascination towards fashion. Often I become amazed at her attires and appearance. \n\nI know her from my childhood. In fact, she used to live with her family adjacent to us in the same locality. We were neighbours. She started her elementary school at the same institution where I also took admission in the same grade. But later, she left the school and joined at another one. Suddenly, she started appearing in some local fashion shows. With her participation in the shows, she attracted the attention of the mass media and some of the large modelling agencies. Then her career as a professional model began. But it was not so smooth as it sounds. She underwent struggles and experienced numerous challenges. First of all, her progress as a model was hindered from her family. But with the change of time, her popularity grew and the family barriers also vanished.     \n\nUsually, she loves to wear a tee shirt and jeans pant. At an interview in a local magazine, she described her personal fashion. But when she is in a photoshoot, she needs to wear dresses prescribed by the agency or photographers. Besides, she also loves to wear the traditional dresses of Cambodia. But she feels comfortable most in the western dresses. She is aware of the fashion and tries to place her signature on the fashion as well. So, whenever there are any latest designs, she is the one to use that first. She also looks fine with formal dresses. Once I had seen an image of her wearing a formal suit. That really looked beautiful. In her personal life, she is also careful about her appearance. She never goes out without a complete makeover that matches with her attires. \n\nChampei Devi is really a fashionable lady now. She always wears the attires of the best designs. Besides, the dresses are colourful as well which make her look stunning. But I have not seen her to be indecent with her dresses. She loves to wear different types of dresses and poses for photo sessions. But none of the attires could prove her to be arrogant or moody. She is simple in her manners and loves to socialise with people. But the outstanding dress code and styles have made her different from others in some sense which is clearly visible. Based on all such reasons, I think she is really a fashionable lady."

    "Answer": "Interesting topic and it just happened to me almost a year ago when I was quite surprised to see Paula, one of my school friends, at a shopping mall all of a sudden. I met her after a very long time that day.\n\nLast year I went to the city super mall to purchase some dresses for my family and met Paula there. Paula was my classmate and one of my closest friends in my high school. Her family settled in Canada just after we graduated from the high school. After a few initial communications, she went silent and I have not heard from her for more than 10 years. Meeting her in a supermall and being in the same shop at the same time was totally unexpected and I was very much thrilled to hear her updates.\n\nWhen I was buying a leather jacket for my younger brother, I noticed a girl was selecting a red dress for a kid and she seemed very familiar to me. I was not sure who she could be and was thinking that she looks like Paula. In fact, Paula looked quite different than she used to look in the school days. It was very tough to recognise her after a long time. However, when she talked to a salesgirl, I recognised her voice. It was unforgettable! I approached to her and to my surprise, she recognised me! We hugged each other and left the shop after we purchase the items we had selected. We sat in a nearby coffee shop and talked for more than two hours.\n\nShe got married, became the mother of two kids and settled in Australia. Her husband is an electric engineer who works in Australia. I was sad to hear that her mother passed away recently and that’s the main reason she came home. She apologised for not keeping the communication, explained her reasons for doing so and took my email and phone number.\n\nMeeting Paula all of a sudden was indeed a great surprise to me. It was totally unexpected and I had no idea I would meet her someday. She was one of my best friends from my school and we had so many memories together. A few years back when I met another friend from high school and he told me that Paula had never communicated any of our school friends, I thought I would never meet her again. However, the world is small indeed and we have our surprises waiting for us just at the corner of the street!!! This was something that came to mind when I met Paula after more than 10 years.\n\nThese days I mostly get her updates on Facebook and she sometimes calls me. I know her updates even if she stays a far away and we are good friends again."

    "Answer": "My short trip to Singapore amazed me in different ways. I met with one of my cousins living in the country after a long. Thank you for allowing me to speak about the issue. \n\nI was born and brought up in Indonesia. I have passed my childhood in Jakarta and never been to out of the city until the completion of my graduation. So, I made a plan immediately after graduation to visit some of the Asian countries. Accordingly, I made the trip to Singapore. I heard a lot about the Singapore street markets. While shopping in one of the local street markets in the city, I met with Farhan Halim, one of my cousins from my mother’s side. In fact, he has been living in the country for over a decade. I met him last about 10 years ago in Indonesia when he went there with his newlywed wife.   \n\nI went to Bugis Street Market to get some new clothing for me. While I was shopping at the market, I met with Halim. He was extremely happy to see me in the market. I wanted to make the trip alone and thus did not inform him about my arrival in Singapore. Besides, being an introvert, I love to do everything alone. Socialising is really difficult for me. So, I intentionally did not inform him about the visit. He was angry with me for this reason. Then he took me to his home and cancelled my stay at the hotel. He has not been changed a bit than the time I met him last. He is happy with his family and two kids. In fact, the accidental meeting with him helped me to get reunited with his family and other relatives of mine living in Singapore.       \n\nHalim is my cousin. He is the elder son of my maternal aunt and senior to me of around 13 years. I did not have a close contact with him in my childhood. When I grew up and got matured, he left the country and settled in Singapore. He also got married here and maintaining his medium-size store. He has a departmental store and remains busy round the day to take care of it. Though I did not have a close bond with him, he and his family gave me a warm hospitality. I am really pleased with their initiatives to entertain me till my departure from the country. We had lots of fun together and I especially enjoyed the remaining days in Singapore.    \n\nThe meeting with Halim was surprising to me. In fact, I did not expect that I could meet with him. His shop was adjacent to the street market where I was shopping. He was moving to his store and on the way he noticed me. I knew that he lives in Singapore but I did not have the address of him. So, I also thought it was unnecessary to look for him. But meeting him on the street really amazed me to the largest extent. As he was familiar with my shyness and introvert nature, he took the event easily and chided me with a smiling face. Later, the events at his home were filled with enjoyment and happiness. Considering everything, it was a kind of a surprise to me."

    "Answer": "In fact, I know many people who can speak a second language. Just after I looked at this Cue Card topic, their names and faces came to my mind. However, for this cue card topic, I would like to talk about my uncle, Joseph, who can speak English very fluently. English is the second language in our country and many of us can speak it quite fluently. However, my uncle Joseph was graduated from the London University and stayed in London for more than 7 years. After he came back to his motherland, he went into the teaching profession. These days he teaches history in a college.\n\nJoseph is 2 years younger than my father and I know him from my childhood. He is around 40 years old now and stays near our house. He is a doting father of 3 children and a devoted teacher who is loved by his students. He has a good and natural accent and a pleasant speaking style that give a soothing feeling when I listen him speak. He has a great way of teaching and I often took his advice regarding my studies. Whenever I had any complex grammatical issue, he was the person I turned into for the help. He could explain things like a magician!\n\nApart from his mother tongue, he can speak English very fluently and I heard that he can also speak Spanish, Hindi and French. I have seen him speak with many American and British teachers and it seemed to me that he speaks very naturally with them. I guess he has to speak English every day at the college he teaches in has got many foreign students and teachers. He needs to deliver his lectures in English as well. I sometimes speak English with him and I am no match for his fluency, academic knowledge and experience.\n\nLearning a second language is a must in our school curriculum.  So everybody has to learn a second language in our country. In most of the colleges and universities in our country, the lectures, exams and academic books are in English. My uncle must have learned this second language as part of his academic study. However, his study in a university in the UK and his 7 years staying in this country must have improved his knowledge and language fluency to a great extent. The other foreign languages that he can read and speak must have been the result of his personal interests and he must have learned them due to his stay in different countries."

    "Answer": "My dad, Astor Beaman is a French in nationality but he is fluent is a second language. He can speak and write Spanish fluently. In fact, he has learnt the second language for necessity. His office requires a second language skill. \n\nMy dad is a man of letters and has a high degree in international affairs from a reputed university here in France. He looks smart with his tall figure and dark blue eyes. He got married to mum in his university days. Like all others, his early days were filled with thorns. After lots of struggle, he managed to get a job at an international organisation. With his hard efforts and sincerity, he is now an established manager of the organisation. He is to deal with a large number of issues and frequently needs to apply his second language skills.    \n\nDad can speak the Spanish language like the native Spanish people. He learnt the language at a language club. Actually, as part of his career, he wanted to learn some other language. He is quite skilled in English. But he wanted to learn something more that he could use in his regular life. So, he moved for Spanish. Fortunately, he got the job at the organisation which is based in Spain. They had been seeking a suitable candidate to run the activities in France. But by the same time they wanted someone who possesses a command over the language. It was necessary as most of the activities were based on dealing with the Spanish clients and producers. So, if the knowledge of Spanish is poor, the candidate will be unable to handle the entire responsibilities. Luckily, everything matched with dad and he got the job. \n\nHe needs to speak and write in Spanish in his office as most of the staffs are from Spain. They are unable to understand English let alone French. So, he needs to communicate with them in the language round the day. Besides, sometimes he also needs to communicate with the headquarter of the organisation he is working with. He needs to speak Spanish with his superior officials in Spain. Drafting letters, issuing orders and many other tasks require his second language skills. But when he is at home, he speaks French with us. In fact, I have never seen him use the language at home. I went to meet him at his office and came to know about his use of the second language. Also, I was amazed at his skills of using the language in the appropriate places.   \n\nMy dad has learned the language based on his necessity. He understood the importance of the second language and accordingly took the decision to learn it. It took nearly two years for him to learn the language. He attended the language class on the weekends. Besides, he practised the language with some of his classmates at home. He also practised writing in the language a lot. After lots of struggles and challenges, he had completed the course. Now he is enjoying the benefits of his struggle in the past. I think the decision was wise to learn the language. Interestingly, he picked the language randomly and luckily he got the chance to apply the knowledge in his real life. Considering the future aspects, I think he learnt the language by his own initiative."

    "Answer": "One of the best things about our life is that we can keep learning as long as we breathe, and the more we learn, the better it is for us, both personally and professionally. So, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to share here what I want to learn more.\n\nI like to learn about computer networking and internet technology more because it is changing at a very rapid pace. For example, in the beginning, we used a DSL internet connection. Then, we started using a broadband connection because DSL connection proved out to be too slow. But that too was not enough because it was not possible to provide a “wired” network in the rural and undeveloped areas. So, eventually, the expert came up with the idea of wireless, satellite and microwave internet connection. And, all these changes took place only over the last couple of decades mostly. Similarly, I wouldn’t be surprised if we suddenly see that broadband routers and other home gateways are disappearing because devices are able to communicate with each other and the internet directly without the help of any routers or gateways.\n\nHowever, I feel that it would be really difficult to understand about these technological trends and changes without professional help. So, I have decided to get enrolled for a diploma course on networking and internet technology. Besides, I am also planning to buy some good books on internet technology while also watching some educational videos online at the same time. Besides, I believe that I can learn many things on this subject by surfing the internet also.\n\nAnyway, I want to learn more about it because I find the internet and the world wide web to be very fascinating. After all, it only makes sense that we should learn about this technology which has already revolutionized the way we communicate with each other today. Besides, I want to learn it more because I want to be able to fix any kind of networking problems, not only at my home but also at my workplace so that I am valued more by my company."

Now I would like to enhance my knowledge and learn it more.\n\nI was around 15 years old when I started learning it from the Music and Melody society that was run by some music teachers. I was involved in this society only for 4-5 months. I could not finish my lessons on piano playing and have forgotten many things that I was taught. Later on, I have learned how to play the guitar but I never had the opportunity to learn to play the piano.\n\nSince I already have the basic knowledge on how to play the piano, I would like to practise for a month before I get admitted to a music academy that teaches interested individuals how to play the piano. Besides, the internet would be helpful as I would be able to find many lessons and tutorials from it. Video tutorials that are found on YouTube would be helpful as well.\n\nThough I always thought to enhance my piano skill, I could not actually find a suitable place or time to do so. Now, I have finished my graduation and would be able to devote some time to learn it more. Furthermore, one of my cousins has recommended a music academy where I would get admitted in a couple of weeks.\n\nThe piano is one of the most widely used musical instruments in our country and I always had a passion for music. I do not have the plan to start a career in the music industry but music is in my blood. My grandfather was a renowned songwriter and one of my uncles is a vocal in a large music band in our area. I love the melodious and harmonic aura of a piano and being able to play it would be a great accomplishment for me. It’s a passion and I would be happy to learn it more."

    "Answer": "During my childhood days, I used to learn a papercraft at my elementary school and the craft was named as origami. This is a type of art where papers are folded to create different shapes and miniature creatures. Gladly, I will discuss the topic here and thank you for allowing me to talk. \n\nOrigami is the combination of two words – Ori and Kami while ‘Kami’ later turned into 'gami'. This is the art where a good number of designs and sculptors are formed by folding the paper only. The culture originated in Japan but now it is practised worldwide for its popularity. No cuts or glues are used in this art of paper folding. Kids are trained with the origami in their schools but when they grow mature, they forget the practices as I did. So, I want to learn it now and master the skills so that I could practice art every now and then. \n\nLearning origami is not difficult. It needs a sheet of paper to create the sculptors and designs. Besides, the basics are easier to learn which I had learnt in my elementary school. Some of the people try to create origami with cutting and pasting glue on the papers. This is similar to the practice that is done is China. The authentic origami does not need to apply the external resources to complete the sculptor or design. The basic comes with the combination of folds and a good number of tricky folding is available to give the perfect shape. Basically, the designs are done on sheet square in shape. Using sheets of different shades brings a special look at the designs and creatures. \n\nI do not know if there are any professional agencies who train on this art of origami. There are plenty of schools available to train on kirigami which actually I do not want to learn at all. In kirigami, everything is similar to origami but it uses different cuts and attaches glues which appear artificial to me. However, I have been looking for a suitable organisation where I can learn real origami. I can remember the basics but with the change of time, I think the area has improved and lots of changes have appeared. So, I need to learn the latest origami updates. There are some organisations which train origami for the kids and adults are not allowed. I am planning to meet with them and ask them for opening an adult course in origami. I want to learn it as this is a passion for me.   \n\nI have an event management agency in Japan. And often I am responsible for organising a good number of national and international events in and out of Japan. If I am skilled in decoration with origami, I could be able to beautify the venues perfectly. The designs and shapes will be around the event venue. As a result, the event will get a special value to the invited guests and everyone present there. It will help me to get linked with the origin of Japan. The traditional Japanese design will appear in line with the modern art and culture which will uphold my nation as well. So, I want to keep it learning as long as I can and enhance my skills of origami."

    "Answer": "When somebody tells us a lie, we can detect it a certain stage and correct our mistakes. But, when somebody doesn’t tell us the whole truth, it can be even more damaging than a complete lie. But, this is life, and we do face a situation sometimes when we are not told the whole truth just like a time when I wasn’t told the complete truth either.\n\nIt happened about a few years ago when I needed to fix my car. In fact, our car was giving trouble on and off for the previous few months. But, the problem was that we couldn’t find any other reliable car mechanic in my town after a few mechanics, I knew, either left the town or retired. So, when I learnt about the new mechanic and his “credentials”, I felt that we could finally get our car fixed again.  \n\nLater on, I even provided the details also about my car problem to him, and he assured me that he would fix the problem within a few hours. So, the next morning, I left my car in his shop. But, when I came back to pick up my car later in that afternoon, he told me that it would take him the whole afternoon to fix the car as he detected a few other problems, even though I was pretty sure that my car didn’t have any other problems. Later on, I came to know that he didn’t tell me the whole truth because he didn’t find any problem with my car at all, after all, but he certainly wanted me to pay for his “lost time” which he “wasted” in figuring out the problem.\n\nAnyway, when I found out that I wasn’t told the whole truth by the mechanic, I felt a bit sad and mad. But, more importantly, I actually lost my faith in him which could be really damaging for a person’s reputation. However, this incident also encouraged me to learn to fix my own car, and other things, myself in order to avoid this kind of “unpleasant” situation."

    "Answer": "This cue card topic reminds me of a very sad event in my life. I was then a student at the university and one day, I received a call from one of my cousins. He informed me that our grandmother was very ill and she needed immediate medical care. I was very much fond of my grandmother and could not wait to see her. I was quite worried that she had gotten ill all of a sudden. It was more than 7-8 years ago and I did not have a mobile phone as it was very expensive at that time. However, I called my mum from a phone booth and she advised me that I should come to my grandfather’s house immediately.\n\nI had to travel for more than 8 hours before I reached my grandfather’s house. On my way to our village, I met one of my uncles and he looked very sad. I asked him how grandma was doing and he simply answered that ‘not good’. I asked a few more questions about grandma but he could not answer any of them. After I reached my grandfather’s house, I noticed that all of my relatives were present there and everyone looked sad. All of a sudden, I realised that my grandma had passed away.\n\nIn fact, my grandmother died last night and I was called at my university in the early morning. But my relatives did not tell me the truth. There was a logical reason behind their lie. They knew that if they told me the death news of my grandmother, I would be very worried and it would be unsafe for my journey. They wanted to make sure I reach home safely and without any anxiety and then they would reveal the whole truth to me.\n\nAs I was very sad and was crying that my beloved grandma was no more, I was not worried that my relatives concealed the truth. There was a goon intention to lie to me and that was very understandable."

Now, I will describe the entire story here in brief. \n\nAfter completing my higher secondary, I tried to get admitted to a local Art college in Durban in South Africa. By the same time, I attended in the admission test of some other local universities lest I do not miss a year. So, I was unable to collect my result of Art college test. I was told, from my relatives, that I was on the waiting list and hence the possibility to get admitted at the college was pretty slim. I believed them and went on attending the other university tests. But later, when I went to the Art college after a few weeks, I came to know the real truth. I passed the test, was on the merit list but the admission date was over.  \n\nI realised that this was a kind of plot against me and one of my maternal uncles was the key plotter of the issue. In fact, they did not want me to be a painter. They wanted me to be businessmen like them. They are a bit commercial in every aspect. Actually, this is true that being an artist has less value in the present age. It may also not help me to survive in this competitive world. But sometimes you need to listen to your heart. I wanted to be an artist as I can paint very well. So, it would be helpful for me to be an artist and do whatever I wanted with this skill. Gradually, I also found that my dad agreed on the issue to misinform me about my result.     \n\nThey did not tell me the whole truth considering some aspects. First of all, the world is becoming competitive and survival will be challenging in the coming days. So, if I cannot grab a profession or build a suitable career, I will be unable to survive, and it was the view of my family and relatives. So, they made the plan and decided to hide my result from me. But they did not realise that I could figure out the actual truth. It was my bad luck that I paid attention to their comments and did not check the result by myself. They supposed that by hiding the truth from them would be beneficial for me. But by the same time, the decision was to kill my mental faculty which they did not understand. \n\nI felt sad when I missed the chance for admission to the Art college. In fact, it was one of the reputed colleges in the locality and dealt with the different sorts of cultural activities. I preferred the painting section and wanted to complete my graduation on the subject. But for the misguidance of my relatives and parents, I missed the chance of admission here. I have got admission at another college under sociology and planning to try for another admission test in the Art college next semester. I know it is really difficult to survive in this competitive world, but I need to satisfy my inner needs first. I want to be a renowned painter and someday I will be so. Hope my firm determination will take me to the goal."

    "Answer": "To be honest, I don’t really like to subscribe to the idea that there is one best age or stage in our life because the truth is that we wouldn’t be able to grow as a “person” unless we choose to consider each age or stage of our lives as “special”. But, since, this cue card is asking me to do just that, I will try to make it as interesting as possible.\n\nMoving forward, I would say that probably the best stage in my life was when I was a child with an age range of 8-12 years old. This was the stage of my life when I could do pretty much anything and everything (nothing anti-social, of course) without having to worry about any major “reprisal”. However, back then, one of the things, which I really liked to do, was to go to a nearby open field/space and play football and volleyball with my friends and senior brothers after finishing the schools. Then, of course, I also need to mention here about our weekly “fishing activities” in the company of my elder brother which I enjoyed almost every weekend. But, the best thing of all, which I really enjoyed doing every weekend, was to watch the cartoon movies on television with my elder brother and sister while enjoying some special snacks together.\n\nBy the way, my parents didn’t allow us to go to a movie theatre to watch movies back then. So, watching cartoons on TV was something which I really appreciated, especially, if I was doing it with my elder brother. After all, it was my elder brother, with whom I just loved spending my time.\n\nAnyway, I would consider this particular stage of my life as best because I didn’t have to worry about being “judged” by people around me. Besides, this was also a period of time, when I made some “lifelong” and true friends. Finally, I would consider this state as the best because I could enjoy the little things of our life without any “guilty feeling” in me."

    "Answer": "Life is a great journey and in different stages of our life, we have different priorities, activities, responsibilities and interests. However, I believe childhood is a magical period in our lives and most of the people would agree with it.\n\nMy childhood is the best phase of my life and I had an excellent and memorable childhood. I lived with my parents in a suburban area where I had many friends and neighbouring kids with whom I loved to spend time with. We had a team of 6-7 children and our days were full of joyfulness and excitement.\n\nWe used to play indoor games, make our own rules in a game, run beside the green paddy fields without any reason, swim in the river, sometimes quarrel and finally play football in the evening. There was no particular rule or obligation- we did whatever we liked to do as long it was safe and healthy. Our parents used to disrupt our activities only when we started doing something harmful or risky. Apart from that, we were allowed to play the way we wanted.\n\nI loved to collect stamps in my childhood and I spent a considerable amount of time with other kids who had this hobby. I also liked to swim in the river and I was a great swimmer at that time. I could easily defeat other kids of my age in swimming competitions. I liked to go to new places with my friends and that was quite exhilarating in my childhood.     \n\n'Why this was the best stage of my life?' Well, those are the golden days of my life. I believe others would agree that our childhood had a different charisma and we miss it a lot at our later stages. I had plenty of scopes to enjoy the days and had the opportunity to get involved in many electrifying activities that made my days happier. I had no tension, did not have to take responsibilities that were harder to bear or go through any complexities of life. It was simple, full of ecstasy and thrill and I had many friends and loving parents to share my happiness with."

    "Answer": "Childhood is considered as the best part of life. But I enjoyed my adolescence most than any other stage. I was 13 at that time and passed the golden times of my life so far. I am lucky enough to describe the issue here. \n\nThis is the age when you will have some special thoughts and activities. In fact, people perform the silliest activities in this stage of life. I was not an exception to this universal rule. Rather, I was something more wicked in nature than the other boys. I did almost all types of wicked activities and still, I practice those if I get a chance. The adolescence is the age of life which is really a time to enjoy. People can get rid of the blames as they are still immature and with this chance, they can do whatever they want to do. But it should be kept in mind that there should be a limit of wickedness. \n\nI was born and brought up in a village in India. In those days, there was not as much development as it is found now. So, the activities I participated in may appear weird to some. In fact, I did a lot of things that the kids of today even have not heard of. I liked most to steal fruits from trees of my neighbours while they chased me for the stealing. Sometimes they reported the issues to my father and he used to chide me severely for such activities. Moreover, I had a group of kids of the same age. When we got together, we used to do some mischievous activities like stealing domestic animals and selling them in the local market to arrange money for the cinema. Bunking the school was a usual phenomenon for us. Since we all lived in the same area, we made the group and visited many places by bunking school.    \n\nI did not have any close or best friend rather I liked to move in a group. I formed a group of 12 members. We passed most of the times of the day together. In fact, we used to remain together when we were out of the home. If someone of us was in danger, we all moved together to rescue him from the situation. The situations were hilarious – they got caught in mischievous acts. Besides, we also had some common enemies and they were senior to us for one or two years. When they got us alone, they punished us in innovative ways. And we did not have anything to do with them as they were seniors. Besides, we used to play football together. We all contributed to buy football and other sporting elements. So, the times went very well.    \n\nThere are a good number of reasons to consider this age as the best part of my life. When I gradually got matured, I was shouldered with more responsibilities for my education and academic career. Besides, I also had to participate in some familial matters with my father and paternal uncles. So, I lost freedom gradually after the adolescence. But I do not have any regret that I lost freedom. I have had enough fun and lived the days of that age with great enthusiasm. So, I think this was the best stage of my life."

    "Answer": "Well, it is a sad fact of life that it is a lot easier to think of examples of terrible customer service from companies or shops, than it is to think of good service.  However, there is one company I can think of which has an excellent reputation for customer service and based on my own experience, I think it is well deserved. So, I’ll try and describe to you what the service was, when and where I received it and in doing so, explain to you why I think the service was exceptional.\n\nThe service was very simple really, but it became quite complicated, and it was the way the company resolved it which was so impressive.  The company is a British Company called John Lewis.  They are a little bit unusual in that the workforce own shares in the organisation, so that means every individual who works there take pride in doing their job as well as they can, and takes a share of any profits. \n\nJohn Lewis is basically a very chain of upmarket stores, supplying everything from quality household goods and furnishings through to clothes and gift items.  Once my dad had become very ill, and I needed to order some extra bed-linen for him whilst he was being nursed at home.  However, he and my mum live in London, and I live in Sheffield which is two hundred miles away, so I was having to order goods online to be delivered to my parents, many miles away, without knowing quite what it was they wanted.  To cut a very long story short, I got the order horribly wrong, I was feeling quite stressed, and I just chose the wrong products, and then I found that I was too late to cancel the order, and I was worried that if multiple parcels arrived at my parent’s house they would get very confused about what was what.  Also, I was quite skint at the time, and couldn’t really afford to pay for both sets of products, especially as only one order was really needed.  It was an absolute mess – and I was utterly to blame.  I’d acted in a hurry and so made mistakes, and I couldn’t see how to untangle it.  It’s true what they say ‘act in haste, repent at leisure!’\n\nI rang the customer service line.  Everything that had gone wrong was entirely my fault. I had ordered the wrong goods, I had left it too late to cancel and it was me who had got the delivery details wrong.  I telephoned and explained all that had happened, and why it mattered so much.  At the end of the day, it was only a couple of sheets and some towels, but at that moment in time, they were really important because they were much needed.  The person I spoke to was absolutely lovely.  They managed to somehow by-pass their systems to cancel the order which had been made in error by contacting the courier company direct.  They reimbursed postage charges that I’d incurred for requesting ‘express delivery’ for the original order, and arranged for a new delivery of the correct items.  They even waved through the second order at a lower cost than it should have been to speed things up by converting the first order to the second for the same price.  To them perhaps it was a minor issue for me to be making such a fuss about, but to me, it made an enormous difference.  As a consumer, I had no rights in this matter, everything they did was out of good will, not legal obligation.  I can’t tell you how grateful I was!\n\nSo, why do I think this was such good service?  Because they were kind to me when I had really been quite ‘stupid’ to get things so wrong.  They empathised with my situation in that I was so far away when my parents were in need of help, and I was panicking because the one thing I had tried to do – get new bed linen – had gone wrong.  They worked really hard to go the extra mile to sort things out even though they absolutely didn’t have to because the error was all with me.  The people I spoke to presented a very human face of what is a large organisation, and I remain a very loyal customer to them still.  It is easy to think of companies as impersonal and anonymous, but, in fact, all organisations are staffed by people who are just as human and individual as you and I at the end of the day.  They helped me out when I needed it, and that personal touch proves that the people who work in shops and companies are not unfeeling automatons, they have compassion too.  In some ways, it wasn’t really about ‘good customer service’ at all in the end, it was about kind people helping someone else who needed it.  They provided the help because they could, and they must have felt it was the right thing to do.  You wouldn’t think getting the right sheets could matter so much, but in a time of crisis, it did.  These people recognised this and saved the day.  It was comforting, not just to get the much-needed bed linen, but to know there are such kind people in the world willing to go the extra mile when it was needed.  John Lewis, I salute you and your staff for what you did that day.  Insignificant as it may seem, it made all the difference!"

    "Answer": "Receiving a good service from a company or shop has become a rarity these days, at least, in places where I live. Among such rarity, however, we still “accidentally” receive some good service, just as I did about a few months ago, that makes us feel special.\n\nAnyway, the good service, I am talking about, was provided to me when I visited a furniture store in order to buy a computer desk for my desktop. I needed that desk on an urgent basis because my old computer desk suddenly broke when I was trying to move it from one corner of my room to another in order to free some space. Initially, of course, I was a bit shocked to see my desk breaking like this, but then I realized that the desk was really old and it needed to be replaced.\n\nSo, anyway, as I saw my computer desk crumbling, I rushed to one of the famous retail furniture outlets in my country and asked them what I really needed. After carefully listening to my specification, the manager of the shop showed me a few desks and asked me to choose one from them. After choosing one, my manager assured me that my computer desk would get delivered to my home the next morning. The manager also assured me that if I didn’t like my computer desk for any reason, the shop would replace it with another one without charging any extra money for the delivery cost. The next morning, they did deliver my computer desk just on schedule as they promised, and needless to say, I did like my computer desk.\n\nAnyway, the service, I received, was indeed very good because the manager and the staffs at the furniture shop treated me like a “person” instead of just some “customer”. They were very polite, courteous and tried to find out very patiently about what I exactly needed or looking for. Finally, their service was great also because they stuck to their promised delivery schedule."

    "Answer": "Customer care is an important aspect of the growth of a business organisation in all terms. If the customer care service is not up to the mark, it becomes difficult for the organisation to grow in business. I am happy to have the chance of describing a customer care related experience.  \n\nVery recently, I have bought an iPhone 7 with a notable amount of British pounds from a local apple product selling the store. As an iOS user for the past couple of years, I am quite familiar with the functions and features of an iPhone. Unluckily my iPhone 7, Jet Black colour, was not responding on some of the features. I tried to reset the phone but it was of no use. So, I took the phone back to the local shop and customer care here in East London from where I bought it. The customer care is a few block away from my residence. The customer care authority changed the phone and gave a fresh one to me. I was really happy with the service.  \n\nI bought the phone on January 18 of this year and unpacked it on the same day. In fact, I was excited to enjoy the new features of this latest mode. But I noticed some changes in the phone’s behaviour and thought that it would be for an operating system upgrade. But the behaviours continued for long. I applied a couple of ways to solve the problem. But they were of no use. Besides, there was another trouble with the charging point. The phone did not take charge properly. There was something wrong with the charging port, I think. So, I took the phone on the evening of the next day. The customer care was about to be closed. But the staffs and the branch chief received me cordially and paid attention to my problem. In fact, it was a different type of experience for me. I have never met such a skilled and professional level of customer care service so far.     \n\nI received the service from the apple authorised customer care located in East London. I live in the same area. So, it was not difficult for me to reach the customer care point. Besides, before approaching to the point, I made a phone call to them about my problems. They invited me to have a cup of coffee with them and also assured to discuss the problem with me in person. As per their invitation, I reached there just before the closing of the customer care point. After hearing everything from me, they checked the phone set and found out that it was the manufacturing error. In fact, such errors are entirely unwanted. They were true in their statement. I know it because I have been using the iPhone for over the last four years, and there were no such issues before.  \n\nThis is really difficult to have a very smart and efficient customer care service here in the UK. Everyone is busy with their own business and have less time to care for the customers. But the issue was different with Apple Inc. The company really knows how to deal with people. I have some negative experiences with the customer care of Samsung over complaining about a phone set that had a fast charge draining. They did not even hear of my allegations and the phone set is still unused at home. I could not do anything with such a phone that needs charge over eight times in a day. But I consider this customer care service as an effective and improved one. They really care about their customers. Hope such customer care service will go on always."

    "Answer": "Call me “frugal” or “not-interested-in-random-things”, I seldom buy anything, when I am on a holiday trip, unless of course, they are exceptionally beautiful. But, when I went on a holiday trip last winter, I bought something special without worrying about its price at all.\n\nIt was an extraordinarily-beautiful looking quilt blanket. Of course, I am no expert of quilts, but I was very sure that it was quilted with the utmost care and love from start to finish. And, yes, it was a homemade quilt which used some traditional cotton fabrics both at its top and bottom.\n\nNot sure, how many layers are used in this quilt or what kind of materials are used to make it soft and smooth from the inside, but those materials surely made this quilt very comfortable and light. By the way, at some point, after buying it from the small souvenir shop of the small tourist town near the ocean about six months ago, I became so impressed with it that I actually wanted to tear it a little in order to find out what kinds of materials were used to make it so comfortable. But, I decided against it as I feared that I would destroy that “one of a kind” quilt by doing so before even taking it to home.\n\nAnyway, before taking it to my home, I wrapped up the quilt in some beautiful coloured paper and offered it to my dear mother as a gift.  After all, I wanted my mother to use it as a blanket, and needless to mention, she just loved the idea!\n\nAnyway, I think that it was something special, primarily because of the way it was made. After all, it was quilted with some extraordinary designs and artworks. It was special also because my dear mother loved it as soon as she had seen it and touched it. Finally, it was special also because it couldn’t only be used as a blanket but also for the purpose of home decoration."

    "Answer": "A few months ago I went to Switzerland on a holiday and brought home a painting from a local shop in Zurich. It was a large painting and I had to pay a large sum of money as the tax at the airport to bring it home. However, it was such a nice piece of painting that it was actually worth the hassle and money. It was a large oil painting that depicts a beautiful natural scenery common in Switzerland and not quite common in my homeland. I have hung it in my drawing-room and this is one of the most beautiful and cherished souvenirs for me.\n\nIt was a 5 days holiday tour that was arranged by my office and we went to Switzerland on this tour. We went there in early January and visited Geneva, St. Moritz, Zurich, three museums on different places  and Swiss National Park. The alpine scenery, picturesque villages, glittering blue lakes, beautiful lakeside and astounding tranquillity of the villages took our breath away. Luckily a festival was going on during our visit to Zurich and this was another pleasant surprise for me. I visited almost all of the stalls and enjoyed the exotic foods and items they were selling. I bought the oil painting from this festival and this was something I liked when I first looked at it.\n\nAs soon as I brought it home, it became one of the best souvenirs for me and my family. I showed it to my parents and they also liked it very much. Then I decided to hang it in our living room. Every time I look at this painting, it reminds me of the exciting and memorable days I had spent on our holiday in Switzerland. Apart from that, the painting is a bit different than the other paintings I have in our house. I do not know about the painter of this mind-blowing painting, but I am sure he or she must be a very talented artist who has an inherited talent for portraying the beauty of nature in a magical way. I have brought home some other souvenirs from my other tours and holidays from different parts of the world like a neckless for my sister, a set of forks for my mother, a few dresses for me and other family members, a wooden toy gun, a guitar, a wooden box and so on but the painting I brought from Zurich festival is my personal favourite till now."

    "Answer": "Street shopping in Thailand is really an outstanding idea to collect home appliances. In my last holiday in Thailand, I brought an electronic stove. This really is of great importance to me now. It helps to cook the foods early than the ordinary stoves. \n\nUsually, I like to shop at the street markets wherever I go. And accordingly, I take some notes to buy the things I need from the street markets. Being a bachelor, it is really difficult to cook foods and it is hard indeed to manage time to cook foods in the morning. An electric stove was the best solution for me. So, when I got the chance to get it, I did not miss it. Besides, the street markets of Thailand offer a wide variety of the piece and within a reasonable budget. On the other side, in my native city Tokyo it is much pricy. \n\nIn each of the summer, I make a holiday visit in different attractive places inside the country, Japan. But this time I changed the plan and travelled outside of Japan. Thailand is a place of natural beauty and has many notable tourist spots. So, I moved to Thailand with some of my engineer friends. As this was a short visit of five days, I was unable to move in all the attractive places. I just have visited some of the notable places. Besides, I moved in the street markets and made a huge shopping for my parents and some of the close buddies. It was really an interesting experience for me to shop in the street. Actually, I am not habituated with such types of shopping. Besides, haggling appeared as one of the common features of the street markets. But everything went fine with me. \n\nThe electric stove is made by a reputed Korean manufacturer and it runs well. In fact, there are some magnetic mechanisms that help to cook faster than the other types of stoves. After bringing the stove in Japan, I started using it. I have my parents who live in the other part of the city and I live in the university dormitory. I do not prefer to take food out of the home, and thus I cook my own food. But the stove of the dorm was not up to the mark and I had to wait in a queue to cook my meals. As a result, I made late for my classes in the morning. Now, this is easier for me. I can cook my meals or anything whenever I want. I do not need to move in a queue with the other students and get the cooking done.  \n\nThe electric stove is special in some aspects. First of all, it can cook very quickly that I want most. The taste of the foods remains the same. Further, it does not require any gas or oil. It completely runs on electricity. As a result, the maintenance cost is limited. Besides, I had burnt my hands a couple of time while cooking on the ordinary stoves. But there are no such risks. This is completely a risk-free device I can rely on. Based on such grounds, it appears to me that this electric stove is special to me."

    "Answer": "To tell the truth, I have a habit of getting into some fierce arguments with my friends from time to time to decide on the most exciting sports, that we know of, and almost every time, I win the arguments. Do you know why that is?\n\nWell, I win because I always opt for “football” (or soccer) to argue because I don’t think that there is any more exciting sport in this world than football. Yes, world cup football is probably the only tournament in this world that connects almost every single person on this planet. To give some even more jaw-dropping statistics, more than 250 million people in more than 200 countries around the globe play this sport. So, one can only imagine how popular this sport really is!\n\nAnyway, football is a rather easy sport to play because it doesn’t really have that many complex rules. All one needs to do is to send the ball inside the goal post of his opponent team without committing any foul, and whichever teams scores more “goals” by sending the ball inside the goal post of their opponent team, it becomes the winner.\n\nBy the way, I am not too sure how or why I actually came to like this sport so much, but I have been lucky to know about this game since my early childhood when my dear uncle used to take me to a football stadium in order to watch him playing like a tiger! Not to mention, back then, I didn’t really know about the rules of the game at all, but everything became clear to me soon as I myself started to play this sport.\n\nAnyway, I find football so exciting, mainly because it is probably the only game in which the winner or loser is not decided until the very last moment. I find it exciting also because it creates such tension and rivalry, both strategic and physical, throughout a match that one actually forgets to even take his or her breath!"

    "Answer": "This is a nice topic to talk about and I thank you for this opportunity. Exciting sports are fun to play or watch, offer a thrilling experience and attract many people, especially the young. Aerobatics, air racing, parachuting, skydiving, field archery, badminton, volleyball, basketball, cricket, skateboarding, river surfing and ice climbing are some of the very exciting sports in my opinion. For this cue card topic, I would talk about cricket that I personally find very enthralling and exciting.\n\nThe modern version of this sports date back to the 18th century and this is quite popular in Australia, England, South Asia, Southern Africa, and in many other countries. Two teams compete to defeat each other and each team has 11 players on their side. There are three main variations of this sports and they are One Day International, T20 and Test Series.\n\nI have played this sport almost every day in my high school days. I even had been a part of our high school cricket team. These days I often watch cricket tournaments on sports channels. As our national cricket team plays this sports on the international level and one of the members of the 9 test playing countries, this is the most popular sports in our country. I would say this is an easy sport once you know the rules. However, being a good batsman or a dependable bowler requires dedication and regular practice. Since I have played this sport for more than 7-8 years, it does not seem difficult to me. Nevertheless, it can be difficult for someone who has never played it before.\n\nThe very nature of this sports, the competition between the players of both teams, the uncertainty of the result, the timely decisions and physical fitness it demands to win are all very exciting and enthralling. This sport even offers a huge excitement to the spectators who enjoy it either in a stadium or on the TV. A simple mistake or a timely decision can alter the result of this sports. Finally, run-chasing is quite unique about this sport and make it more enjoyable. Millions of people enjoy live cricket tournaments all over the world due to the entertainment, excitement and joy this sport brings to them. As I have played this sport for a long, I find it even more challenging, entertaining and exciting."

    "Answer": "I love to take part in and enjoy sports. So far, I have enjoyed a good number of indoor and outdoor sports but none of them attracted me as it was done by ice hockey. This is a great and exciting sport for me. Besides, this is special in some other sense.\n\nIce hockey is dissimilar than ordinary sports. It is usually played on the ice. The ordinary hockey is played on sports ground filled with grass. But the basic difference is that ice hockey is played on ice while the players need to wear skates during the play. Besides, there are six players in each of the sides and one of them, from each of the teams, tries to protect the goals from opposition. The players are to skate up and try to make goals in the net of the opposition team. There are no balls rather a rubber puck is used to score the goal.\n\nIn my country, ice hockey is a popular sport. Before watching a match live from the ground, I actually did not have any idea about ice hockey. I have seen the sport on television and did not have that much interest. I went to the National Ice Rink in our capital city with some of my friends a couple of years ago. I felt the excitement inside. The game was really an interesting one. The scoring of goals, the attires of the players and the gaming rules etc. appeared interesting to me. Since then, I have become a regular spectator of this sport. Unluckily I am unable to take part in this game due to my age, I love it more than anything.\n\nYes, this is a difficult sport. It needs lots of physical energy and strength. Besides, to play the sport, one needs to learn to run on ice using skates. Falling on the ground is a common issue here. Besides, there are chances of serious injury if you cannot play or defend the stroke from the opponent. Further, the players are to move across the field to grab the rubber puck. They share the puck with the team members and move ahead with the view to score a goal. But sometimes, there are accidents as well. So, to prevent unexpected accidents, the players wear defensive clothes and strong helmets. The goaltender is on the risk than any other players as he is often the target of the opposition players.\n\nTo me, this is a really exciting sport for many reasons. Firstly, I like the sport for its physical benefits. The sport helps to keep fit physically. The players need to move on the ground with skates on their feet. So, they need to keep balance as well during the entire playing session. Initially, it may appear that the game is not that much exciting but the real excitement is understood once you enter into the playing venue. The spectators and surrounding people feel a deep sense of joy when the watch the ice hockey. The sport is exciting because of its nature. International competitions are held periodically and the players are also respected around the world. In fact, ice hockey requires some special expertise which is really hard to gain. So, I think ice hockey is an exciting sport to many of people like me."

    "Answer": "I like to browse different things on the internet whenever I get a chance because it allows me to learn a lot of interesting things. Today, I would like to talk about one such interesting thing that I learned recently.\n\nNow, what I learned may not be interesting to many, but it was, at least, interesting to me because I had no idea about the exciting world of animation video up and until I read that interesting article on “how to make an animated video without breaking a sweat” on the “daily technical tips” section of a national daily of my country.\n\nBy the way, I wasn’t necessarily looking to find any tips on how to make an animated video, as I was solely interested in reading the daily important news. But, some really funny cartoons on the “daily technical tips” caught my attention which led me to read that article.\n\nAnyway, the article clearly provided the instructions, step by step, on how to really create an animation video like a professional without spending any money and without ever attending a technical school. Of course, initially, I wasn’t really too sure that making an animation video was going to be that easy, but when I actually started to try making one, I felt like it was as easy as a “walk on the park”. In fact, I felt like if an “average” person like me could do it, any other people could do it too. So, I told this to some of my friends, and they were immediately onto their acts to create some of their own funny animated videos.\n\nWell, it was important for me to learn making an animated video because I could actually show those videos to my 4 years old nephew in order to make him giggle when he is in a mood or gets cranky. It was important to me also because I eventually used that skill to earn some extra money for myself."

    "Answer": "The Internet is perhaps the most wonderful and helpful modern invention that has touched the lives of billions. This worldwide network has not only revolutionised the way we communicate, shop or exchange information but has also changed the way people learn new things, teach others, do travel plans, get enrolled in a course and so on. I personally thank you for the opportunity you gave me to talk about something I have recently learned from the Internet.\n\nIn fact, I use the Internet almost every day and learn new things quite often. One of the things I have recently learned  is how to reuse the ordinary plastic bottles we throw away almost  every day. While surfing the Internet, I found that one of my friends has shared a video that shows different utilities of plastic water bottles and soft-dring bottles. the creator of the video called it a lifehack and uploaded this video on YouTube. From YouTube, this friend of mine shared it on his Facebook account. It was 15-16 minutes video and I was quite amazed by the idea and genius behind this video.\n\nRecommending something that I like with my friends has become quite easier these days. I only need to press a button or click the mouse to share content with my friends. In fact, just after I watched it, I have shared this video with my Facebook, Google+ and Twitter friends. As I find this video and its contents helpful, I would definitely recommend it to my friends.\n\nAs I have already told, the idea behind this video was quite remarkable and this has taught me something that I never thought would be possible. The video was professionally made and it was easier to follow the process described in this video. I was quite astonished how a simple plastic bottle could be turned into so many useful things. I watched this video several times and found that it showed 20 handy utilities of plastic bottles including how to make these. I  learned how to make a plant pot, soap bottle, basket, napkin holder, kind's pencil holder, leaf lamp, piggie bank, decorative container, jewellery stand, bird feeder, hanging-chandelier and many other handy things out of the ordinary plastic bottles.\n\nLearning how to upcycle plastic bottles to make those handy and beautiful things was very important to me. Up until I learned how to upcycle the plastic bottles, I mostly threw away those bottles and never thought about their practical use. Now I have made two holders for my small plants, a piggie bank, a bird feeder and a pencil holder and I felt an enormous pleasure in making them. I will try making other things that were demonstrated in this video. Such crafty works, I believe, foster our creativity, hones our skills and saves money. The utmost pleasure I can feel when I successfully make something useful from an ordinary plastic bottle is unparallel. This is quite important to me due to its practical usefulness and creative processes. I would definitely watch similar video and tutorials and learn such skills more in the future."

    "Answer": "This is the age of technology. By dint of technological advancement, people are moving ahead. Outsourcing is one of the wonders of the technological advancement that is making people independent in all terms.\n\nIn the present age, the world is a global village. Distance is not a barrier now to work from a different country. So, the number of offshore employees is on the rise. It has happened for the improvement of technology. People now can communicate easily even in the distant part of the world. As a result, when the youths do not get jobs in their native lands, they are moving for freelancing. It is also known as outsourcing. They work sitting at home and get paid at the end of their projects. Earlier, I was unaware of the issue. Though I heard about freelancing, I did not have a clear idea until I searched the issue on the internet.    \n\nI am a middle-aged man and been engaged in a personal business here in Mozambique. I own a medium-sized restaurant and also a small coffee shop. So, I was not that much familiar with technological advancements. But now I need to explore the virtual arena for some reasons. I needed a piece of software to maintain my restaurant accounts and started using the internet to know about it. Later I started browsing the internet and came to know about a lot of things and information that I did not know before. Gradually, I learnt about freelancing issues and how the service is provided. There is a wide range of scopes to work as a freelancer. But for this, people need to have some sort of special set of skills like designing a web page, skills with photo editing, writing capacity and more.  \n\nOf course, I will recommend it to my friends. This is really an interesting thing to share. Many of my friends are not well versed with technology. Even some of them are unaware of using computers while I am a bit different from them. So, if I share the information with them, they might be beneficial. They might grow the interest on the internet and will try to start some sort of outsourcing after their qualifications. In fact, all of my friends, including me, are moderately educated but we lack the knowledge of computer and internet. So, the issue of freelancing was unfamiliar with us. Recently my contact with the internet has made it clearer and I want all my friends also should know about the vastness of the internet.\n\nThis is really an important aspect for me. I want to know the entire world and the internet is the best possible thing that can help me for this purpose. Besides, there are potentials to generate income as well. Considering all the aspects, it appears that freelancing is really an important issue for me. But I need sometimes to get skilled over the specific sectors I need to work. I can paint very well and I think if I learn graphics design, I could shine in the arena. As a fresh internet user, it may take time for me to master the skills but I will be patient to reach my goal."

    "Answer": "I can think of a lovely surprise to share with you.  I’m going to tell you what it was, where it happened and when, and then explain exactly why the unexpected happening made me so happy.\n\nThe surprise started with a card from the post office put through my letterbox.  The card said that they had tried to deliver a parcel to me, but because I was out when they called they hadn’t been able to leave it, so I’d have to go and pick it up from the parcel depot.  I was intrigued.  I hadn’t ordered anything online, it wasn’t my birthday, and I wasn’t expecting anything exciting in the post at all.  I had no idea what it could possibly be.  The next morning I went to the post office with some ID to prove who I was, and collected the parcel.  It was a box, about the size of a shoebox, wrapped in a dark grey plastic packaging, with the name of the company ‘blurt’ on it.  I was none the wiser, I didn’t recognise the company and couldn’t tell who it was from by the wrapping. \n\nI waited until I got home, and then I opened it.  The parcel contained a brown cardboard box which said ‘Buddy Box’ on the outside.  Inside, was a collection of rather random, but very charming gift items.  They included a pair of socks made from bamboo; some rather strongly scented soap (I wasn’t too sure about that!); a little blank pad of writing paper with a cover decorated with cactus plants, a ‘sew your own’ cactus kit (that was very bizarre) and an ultra-thin pen for sliding inside a diary or notebook!  There was still no card to say who it was from, but just an anonymous typed note saying ‘I saw this and thought of you!’  It was a completely unexpected gift, sent by someone, somewhere to cheer me up.  I’d had a rather bad time recently following a bereavement and losing my job as well, so I’d been quite down, knowing that someone was thinking about me was really touching, and as well as being a surprise, made me very happy.  The parcel came just a month ago, so it is a very recent surprise, but a lovely one. \n\nSo that is the ‘what’, the ‘where’ and the ‘when’, as to the ‘why’ that is perhaps a little more complicated than you might at first think.  Of course, it was lovely to receive the gift from someone, the contents didn’t matter, it really was ‘the thought that counts’ as the English saying goes, but what made it extra special, was trying to guess who it was from.  I’d been feeling quite lonely, but when I tried to work out who might have sent the parcel to me, I realised I just didn’t know.  Even though I had been feeling a bit sorry for myself, I could actually come up with quite a long list of people who might have been thinking of me and wanting to cheer me up.  I was astonished, and I felt very lucky indeed. \n\nSo this surprise made me happy, not only because it was an unexpected gift of lovely things, but also because it reminded me of how many friends I had around me who cared about me at a difficult time."

    "Answer": "Thank you for this interesting cue card topic. I will be more than happy to share a story here when I was truly surprised and also felt very happy. It was indeed a very precious day for me when that happened.\n\nAnyway, it happened about 7 years ago when I was a final year university student. Back then, my dearest uncle, who loved me with his life, was serving in the United Nations peacekeeping force who I hadn’t seen for almost 5 years. But, that year suddenly, we got the news that my uncle would come home for a few days in order to celebrate one of our most sacred religious festivals. Needless to say, when I got that news, I became so happy and excited that I felt like I was actually flying on the moon.\n\nBut, unfortunately, all of that excitement and happiness of mine didn’t last that long as only a few days later, we got the news that he wouldn’t be able to join us in our celebration due to some unavoidable circumstances. Of course, it wasn’t the first time that such thing happened, and so, all of the members of my family took the disappointing news easily, even though, I was really hoping that my uncle would somehow magically show up to celebrate with us.\n\nAnyway, I guess God listened to my prayer and decided to grant me exactly what I had wished for. In fact, my uncle did show up at our home just the night before the start of our religious festival. When we saw him, we just couldn’t believe our own eyes.\n\nWell, it was indeed a very pleasant surprise, and it made me really happy because I could finally meet my dear uncle after all those years. It made me happy also because it happened on the eve of a very special occasion when we all look to celebrate with all of our loved ones together, no matter how far apart we really are from each other."

    "Answer": "The whole point about surprises is that they can catch you completely unawares. You wake up one morning with no particular expectation that anything unusual is going to happen that day, and perhaps anticipating a rather ordinary and dull working day or weekend ahead of you. Then something remarkable happens, and the world feels full of exciting possibilities and adventures all over again!\n\nI’m going to talk to you about a really big surprise that made me very happy indeed.  I think you too will be a bit taken aback with how unexpected it was as I tell you the ‘what’ the ‘where’ and the ‘when’ – I imagine you won’t need me to explain too much why the surprise made me happy, but I will tell you about that two.\n\nI’ll start with the where and when, because that makes more sense of the story.  It was a Saturday morning about two and a half years ago.  I went down to my local park near to where I live in Sheffield, to take part in a 5km run which is a regular weekly event called Parkrun, which lots of people in the UK participate in, there are over 364 different Parkrun events held in open spaces across the UK so it is quite a phenomenon.  This particular event is quite large, with around 500 runners - of all different ages, backgrounds and speeds – taking part.  On this particular day, after the run, I was walking away towards home when I suddenly saw a face I recognised.  ‘Hello’, I said, ‘hello Lucy’ she replied, and that was the beginning of our reunion.  The person I’d recognised was someone I had been at school with thirty years ago in a completely different part of the UK.  When she finished school, she’d moved away to Sheffield to study and made a home here, I hadn’t kept in touch with her, so when I myself moved to Sheffield to take up a new job some 25 years later, I had no idea she lived in the same city.  We met each other completely by chance after three decades, and recognised each other instantly.  It was certainly a surprise!  What made it even more unexpected, was that we were both taking part in a sporting activity.  At school, neither of us had enjoyed physical education, or PE as it was then called, and quite often had skipped school to avoid it!  It was so funny to us both that we should meet up after so long, at such an unlikely occasion and in a city hundreds of miles away from where we used to live as children.  We went off for a ‘quick’ coffee to catch up, and ended up talking solidly for over 3 hours!\n\nIt made us both very happy because we picked up on an old friendship almost exactly where we had left off.  We now meet up at the same event every Saturday, and after our run, we still go for breakfast each week.  We also take part in running events together – though I’m really slow and she’s really fast, so we don’t have everything in common.\n\nSo that particular day brought a very unusual surprise my way, and one which made me happy not only at the time, but right up to the present day and I hope beyond it too.  It is good to be reminded to look around you and to be open to the unexpected, it makes life a lot more interesting, and a lot more fun!"

    "Answer": "Living a decent life without a car is really troublesome. I am lucky that I got a car as a gift from my parents marking my graduation day. In fact, it was a surprise for me. They, earlier, hinted me about this. I am really happy with this surprise gift.\n\nThe car was an Aston Martin V12 Vantage S. This is a sports car and comes with some special features. Riding the car was a different experience for me. Its speed was great while I enjoy the top speed more than anything. I believe this is a unique car and could not be compared with the other sports car. The engine and exhaust sounds are up to the mark and prove that this is something special. It has the latest satellite navigation system which makes the trips outstanding. I am in love with the interior design of the car, its lightweight wheel and much more. I am extremely grateful to my parents.\n\nIn December last, I have completed my graduation from the University of Colima in Mexico. I was a student of economics and scored the highest GPA in the graduation exam. So, every one of my family including my parents was extremely happy. Before appearing in the exam, dad told me to study hard. He also suggested me to get the top score if possible as he wants me to take care of his business. Besides, he hinted for a surprise too. I did not know what the surprise would be but I studied hard. I studied for about 12 hours in a day. Finally, I was able to grab success. On the day of result publication, I came to know about my success. One of my mates informed about the score while I was on the way top university. I informed the issue to my dad. He asked to return home quickly to receive the surprise.\n\nBut I cannot reach home early, I was late. It was my buddies who did not let me leave the university early. I had to pass for about two hours with them and entertained at a restaurant for my success. In fact, they all loved me much and wanted to celebrate my success. So, I failed to defy their requests. Finally, I reached home at around 4.30 pm. My dad was standing on the porch and the brand new car was expecting its young rider. Dad handed me over the keys and said that the car was the surprise. My mum was standing aside and her face was shining with joy for my grand success. Dad was happy too.\n\nThe surprise made me happy for numerous reasons. It was really difficult for me to ride on public transports to go to different places. Besides, I was saving money for a car but it was difficult for me to gather a huge amount of money to get a brand new car. So, I asked dad to support me in my initiative to get a car. He denied the issue showing many excuses. In fact, he is a businessman and owns a large amount of wealth. His business is expanded across the country. It is not hard for him to contribute to my account to get a used car. But I think he had something else in his mind and the brand new Aston Martin shows the proof. So, I was happy indeed with this surprise on my graduation day."

    "Answer": "Thank you for choosing this nice cue card topic for me as it will allow me to talk about a close friend of mine. His name is Matt Henry, and he has been one of my best friends since my early university years.\n\nI met Matt about 9 years ago when I was a 1st-year university student. Since we both lived in the same dormitory and loved to practice table tennis in our sports hall, it was quite natural for us to have casual talks with each other once in a while.\n\nBut, I wouldn’t really call ourselves as “close” friends as yet at that time because we would hardly meet or talk to each other outside of our table tennis practice back then. But that slowly changed after several months when my scientific calculator suddenly stopped working, and Matt loaned his calculator to me for a few days. Our friendship grew even stronger and meaningful after a few more months when I taught him to play the guitar. By the way, Matt didn’t have any idea that I was able to play the guitar until he incidentally found me arguing about the guitar playing skills of a famous music band of my country with a couple of music enthusiasts of our dormitory. And, it was at that time, I realized that Matt was a passionate person about arts and culture, just as he still is today.\n\nThis close friend of mine is also a fun-loving person who still enjoys watching old movies on his television. But, above all, if I don’t tell how helpful of a person he really is, I will do a great injustice to his reputation as a close of mine.\n\nWell, I like Matt, mainly because he loves life while hardly forgetting to share his fun with his friends around him. I also like this close friend of mine because he never hesitates to help others even if it means suffering his own loss. However, above all, what makes Matt so likeable is that he is always true to himself."

    "Answer": "Thank you, sir/ madam, for this opportunity to let me talk about one of my closest friends. Without a doubt, that would be Martin, who is a very intimate friend of mine and with whom I spend a lot of time these days.\n\nI know him for more than 8 years. I can still recall the day we first met and that was the very first day in our high school. He sat next to me and when our new class teacher gave us a task to complete, I could not find my pen that supposed to be in my bag. Noticing that I was searching my bag over and over again, Martin gave me one of his pens and I thanked him profoundly for saving me from an embarrassment, especially in front of a room full of new classmates! The next day we sat together again and this arrangement went on for a long. In the meantime, I found that he plays football, which I also did and he became a member of our high school debate club which was also an activity I was very passionate about. Within a few months, we became good friends and in a year we became very close.\n\nMartin is a good person and a very helpful friend. The most remarkable characteristic of Martin is his leadership quality. He can quickly judge a situation, make an action plan and act promptly. Several times his prompt decision-making ability saved us from unexpected and difficult situations. Furthermore, he is very talented, well-read and well-travelled. The stories we heard from him about his tour in Europe were quite remarkable. Finally, he looks like an athlete and very strongly built. He runs for more than 2 miles each morning, a habit I wish I would take up! He is very kind, contrary to his heavy built, and soft-spoken.\n\nWhy do I like Martin? - Well, this is probably because he is a great person. He is one of my best friends and I like to spend time with him. We have some common interests and passions that make us close friends. I like the leadership quality he possesses and the way he often helps other selflessly.  Finally, as a close friend, I know him very intensely. I would certify him to be a good human being, a humble person, a good and helpful friend. I hope our friendship lasts forever!"

    "Answer": "My recent graduation ceremony was outstanding. It appeared all the connections with my university mates and friends are finished after the ceremony. But we will maintain contact with each other, especially my link with Sabrina Nubia will remain forever.\n\nI am the only daughter of my parents. They have always tried to do the best for me. With their inspiration and association, I got admitted to the Al- Azhar University in Cairo in Egypt. It was the very first day of my university when I met with Nubia. She is an extraordinary girl with an exceptional smiling face. We have a strong bond of friendship and in some cases, she is more than a friend. She turns a guide and mentor for me. I take important decisions with a discussion with Nubia. She also loves me much. In fact, we have a healthy friendship and it has been five years since we are maintaining this.   \n\nI met with Nubia in the classroom She was the only girl in the first few days with us in the class. Actually, not much of the students prefer Social Science as their subject. So, the number of students was less than the other departments. But after a week of the class, we got some other students. As a result, there were 37 students in our class and the number of female students was only 12 including me. But there was a close relationship with everyone inside the class. Besides, the teachers were also happy seeing the intimate bond among the students which is not found in the other classes. Since she lived near my residence, we used to move together for classes. Gradually, the bond between us grew stronger and we turned into best friends.    \n\nNubia is a great person. She is extremely helpful in all matters, especially about academic assistance. She helped me and many other students in several ways. Whenever I missed any class for any reason or needed any guidance overtaking any notes, she came into my help. We had some group studies before the exam nights. Either she came to my place or I went to her and the next day moved for the exam. Furthermore, she is also a person who does not know how to turn angry. In fact, I have not seen such a cool person like her. She never got agitated or irritated with the negative attitudes of her surroundings. She dealt with the issues in a calm manner and finally, she became the winner.    \n\nI like Nubia for many reasons. She is a great friend of mine; in fact, she is my best friend. With her attractive smile, she wins the heart of people she meets. She never makes any false promise and tries to keep her commitment. I have never seen her being rude to anyone. In addition, she was from a noble family where she was taught all the manners. I loved her way of explanation. She is able to explain the most complicated thing in a simple manner. I think this is the quality that she inherited from her family. Overall, she is a loveable person for her amiable nature. Thereby, I like her the most."

    "Answer": "Buying a perfect gift for someone or for an occasion is always a challenging task. But it becomes even more challenging when the gift is sought for a barely 5 years old who is not too sure about what he really wants as a gift.\n\nAnyway, this 5-year-old little boy was my one and only nephew who was very hard to please. Therefore, I wanted to do my best to find the perfect gift for him so that he would actually like them and use them instead of leaving them in some corner of his room.\n\nSo, I and her mother (my elder sister) decided that we would buy a very nice looking tricycle for him on his 5th birthday. The idea of buying a perfect looking tricycle was a good one except, of course, we just didn’t know what size of a tricycle he would prefer. But, an even bigger problem was that there weren’t many tricycle stores in our home town, and therefore, we actually needed to be extra careful in choosing a good quality tricycle.\n\nBut, still, we started to check whatever tricycles, we came across, thoroughly in order to make sure that they were the right size. Of course, it was a very time confusing effort, but in the end, we somehow got lucky to find a perfect looking tricycle which was both nice looking and safe for a 5-year-old. By the way, we spent about 6 hours to buy that tricycle because it was the first time ever that we were buying such a gift, and that too for a boy who is never sure about what he really wants for a birthday gift.\n\nAnyway, after receiving the gift, my little nephew seemed to be elated since he started to ride it immediately after receiving it. He also seemed grateful to us for buying such a decorated tricycle for him, after all, since he did give me a small “thank you” to me."

    "Answer": "There is a saying when it comes to giving gifts, that it is ‘the thought that counts’. Often when people say this, what they mean is that the gift was really terrible, but the recipient no doubt appreciated the sentiment behind it. The choice of gift was perhaps ill-judged, but very well intended, as such, it should be received with warmth and a show of enthusiasm – even if that enthusiasm is a bit forced! However, I think there is also a more positive interpretation, a really thoughtful gift is much more likely to delight both the giver and the receiver than the most expensive of trophies. I always try really hard to think about what gifts my closest friends and family might really like or want, even if they haven’t perhaps worked it out for themselves. Sometimes it’s really easy to think of something and just go out and buy it, at other times it’s much more of a challenge.\n\nI’m going to tell you about an occasion when I knew exactly what it was I wanted to find as a gift for someone, but it was a real problem to find. I’ll tell you what it was; who I bought it for; where I bought it from and how the gift was received.\n\nThere is a bit of a story I’m afraid, so bear with me! I used to live in a little terraced house in a town called Leamington Spa. By chance, I moved into my house just a couple of weeks after my next-door neighbours had also moved in. Fortunately, we got on really, really well together. We used to chat over the garden wall (though I had to stand on tiptoe to do this because I’m quite short); I’d look after their cat when they went on holiday, and we were often in and out of each other’s houses. After a few years, one of them came round to tell me some ‘bad news’ I was terrified about what they might say – was one of them really ill? It turned out that the ‘bad news’ was they had decided to sell up and move away. I was really sad to see them go, but happy they would be moving to a lovely new house which was more suited to their lifestyle. Anyway, it turned out that selling their house was quite traumatic. They found a buyer really quickly, but that person was awkward and petulant and kept insisting on quite unreasonable conditions and threatening to pull out of the sale at the slightest inconvenience. The buyer wouldn’t negotiate on anything, and it all got a bit unpleasant. \n\nAs is often the way, the deal-breaker turned out to be something ridiculously trivial. My neighbours had a really unusual steel soap dish. It had chunky letters spelling out the word ‘soap’ and a similarly chunky tray to put a bar of soap in, and was hung up in their bathroom. It was nice, and it did match the other fixtures and fittings in the room, but it was also most definitely a moveable personal possession that anyone would normally expect to take with them when they moved, and not especially valuable either to be honest. It had been a gift from one of the couple to the other, and had sentimental rather than any great monetary value. However, their house buyer had their eye on it and threatened to walk away from the purchase if it didn’t come with the house. It was unbelievably stupid of the purchaser to insist on such a trivial thing, but it would have been even more stupid for my neighbours to let their house sale fall through because of a soap dish, however, special it might be to them personally. Sadly, they agreed she could have this with the house, and the sale went through.\n\nIn the meantime, I’d been trying really hard to think of a suitable house-warming present for my dear friends to wish them well in their new home but it was tricky. To be blunt, they were a lot wealthier than me and in any case already had most things they needed following a recent wedding and the associated gifts from well-wishers. I couldn’t afford to spend a lot of money, but I wanted to choose something that I knew they would like and would be really thoughtful. I decided I would try and find them an identical soap dish!\n\nIt took me a long time, a couple of months. I searched the internet and eBay for second-hand items (the dish wasn’t manufactured anymore and in any case was not a mass-produced product in the first place). I scoured second-hand shops and looked everywhere. I almost gave up hope. However, one day, I couldn’t believe it! There it was, on eBay! An identical product, in near-new condition, just sitting there waiting for me. I snapped it up immediately with a ‘buy now’ price rather than risking losing out in a bidding war. It really wasn’t very much, it was an unlikely item to desperately want after all! I was so delighted when it arrived through the post and it was indeed exactly as advertised! I couldn’t wait to give it to my old neighbours for their new house!\n\nI rushed round one evening to their new home when they would both be there, and presented it to them carefully gift wrapped. I think they were a bit nervous about opening it because I was so obviously confident they would like it, a lot. They were worried about how to disguise their reactions if they didn’t. It might be hard to pretend. I wasn’t worried though, I just knew it was the perfect gift! I asked them to try and guess what it might be, but they had no idea. Eventually, they ripped off the wrapping paper and… were absolutely delighted! It wasn’t just that they had their soap dish back, it was that they were really touched I’d worked so hard to find it for them, and persevered long after they’d given up any hope of replacing their original one for themselves.\n\nIt is said that it is better to give than receive, I think sometimes it is! My neighbours absolutely loved the present, but I was bursting with pleasure too. I knew I’d got it right, and that they would treasure this unlikely gift too. It was indeed a gift that took me a long, long time to find, but it was very well worth the effort! Since then, they have moved house again – this time, they took ‘my’ soap dish with them! I still smile at the memory, certainly, on this occasion, it really was the thought that counted most!"

    "Answer": "Finding books is not really a difficult task but it really takes the time to get the right book. The same thing happened with me in last Monday. I was tired of searching a book in the local market and finally found that after five hours of continuous search.\n\nIn fact, I wanted to provide the book as a gift to my geography teacher in college. He is really fond of books. I trickily brought out the information which types of books he liked. And then started my mission. But unfortunately, it was hard for me to get the desired book. The book is not available in the local book shops of Mumbai. So, I had to travel to different city markets to get the book. I was astonished that the local libraries do have such a pretty book in their collection. But the shop where I found the book was a small one and did not have many decorations.   \n\nI bought the book for Mr Nripendra Bhowmick. He is the geography teacher in our class. But he does not behave as a teacher rather a very intimate friend for each of the students. He loves to discuss numerous topics and provides the right knowledge to his students. He is a graduate from Cambridge University and thus he is a bit altered than the other teachers. His method of teaching is interesting and he loves to teach independently. He does not follow any strict structure to provide lectures in the class. Besides, he is never irritated with any queries from the students’ side while some other teachers turn angry when they are interrupted in the middle of the lecture. Marking his birthday, everyone planned to give him gifts and thus I decided to present him the book he likes most.    \n\nI bought the book from a book store located in, L T Road, Borivali West in Mumbai. In fact, this is the only shop that collects the books of foreign writers. But there are some differences with the books that are found here. Printing is a great issue to consider before buying a book. Not all the booksellers sell the original print. Rather they sell the photocopied books with an attractive binding and cover. It happens as the original books are a bit expensive. So, the majority of the book readers get the replica. But the shop sells the original books and with superior printing quality. I was lucky to have the store and purchased the book.     \n\nWhen I presented the book, Mr Bhowmick unwrapped it and was glad to have it. In fact, he was highly glad that he gave me a great hug. Besides, he declared that it was the very best gift he has got so far. He had been looking for the book for the last couple of months but did not get it in the local shops. I also did not disclose how I managed the book or how hard I had to struggle to discover it. He was highly excited and thanked me a lot for this priceless gift. I was glad to see his reactions. Moreover, he was amazed at the information that how I knew about the book he had been looking for so long. I smiled gently and reacted as it was coincident."

    "Answer": "I am a great fan of cricket, which is passionately called by many people as the “gentleman’s game”, and I try to watch it whenever I get an opportunity. So, I would like to go ahead and talk about an exciting cricket competition which I witnessed about a few years ago.\n\nThis competition took place at Edgbaston Cricket Stadium when I was visiting a very close friend of mine in that city on a long holiday. But little did I know that Australian cricket team was also touring England in order to play a 3 One Day cricket match tournaments, and one of the matches was scheduled to be held at Edgbaston Stadium just when I was visiting my friend there.\n\nNot to mention, I didn’t want to miss that cricket match since I was very much aware of the dimension of cricketing rivalry between Australia and England. Anyway, England, batting first, amassed a 300 plus runs from their stipulated 50 overs, and so, it was expected that the host country was going to win the match rather easily since they had a very strong bowling line up with some really great fast bowlers.\n\nBut, things changed quickly in favour of Australia when a couple of their batsmen played some destructive innings to take the match away from England. Of course, England also fought back very strongly as they managed to drag the match until the last over, and it was at that time that things got very tense for both the team. In fact, Australia needed only 7 runs in their last over, but England bowled brilliantly to restrict the tourist below 300, giving the England team a well-deserved victory in the end.  \n\nWell, the competition was exciting, mainly because it was full of so many attacks and counter-attacks that the fans actually had to wait until the last ball of the match. It was exciting also because the fans at the stadium cheered for both the teams pretty much equally without supporting one team over the other."

    "Answer": "Ooh, this is an interesting topic, because I can instantly think of the most exciting contest I’ve ever witnessed, but I have a feeling it isn’t quite the sort of example you might have been thinking of when you came up with the topic.  I hope you’ll agree it’s a reasonable spectacle to talk about though.  It was a battle for life or death, literally, and I was so caught up in watching it at the time I could hardly breathe, so surely you will want to hear about it too.\n\nThe competition was in the natural world.  It was a battle for territory, between two mighty creatures. I was going to say ‘insects’ but strictly speaking, that isn’t correct, they were two arachnids. One was a very venomous and aggressive scorpion, and the other a massive furry type of tarantula called a baboon spider.\n\nI was working on a conservation project in South Africa, and after a communal meal with others in the camp where I was staying, I made my way back to my tent using a head torch to light my way. I knew there was a baboon spider living in a burrow near to where I was camping. It might sound a bit strange, but I was quite fascinated by this spider. I had learned that if you caught a moth (easy as they would crowd around the light of my head torch) then you could use it to tempt out the spider. I would do this by holding the moth with my outstretched fingers just outside the burrow’s entrance, and then, after a few seconds, the baboon spider sensing the movement would emerge and grab the moth and drag it back into the earth to eat. People who know me at home in England would be astonished that I did this as actually, I’m quite scared of spiders in my house. However, this tarantula was different, so large, solid and furry solid it was almost like a mammal, and it moved in a predictable way, basically just staying in its burrow, just emerging at night to snatch unlucky prey that attracted its attention on passing by.\n\nAnyway, I had got into the habit of taking a moth back with me after supper, so I could feed the spider as I went past. On this particular evening though as I caught sight of the burrow in the beam of my torch I saw the strangest thing. The great spider was out of its burrow – really unusual as they spend almost the entire time in their underground lairs – and it appeared to be somersaulting! As I watched I saw to my dismay that it was intertwined with a really dangerous scorpion of similar size. I could tell the scorpion was a deadly one, because it had a huge venom-filled sting and relatively small pincers (I looked it up in a book later and it is one of the most lethal species in the continent!). The two were fighting ferociously, tumbling about in the orange earth and short scrub grass. I called over a friend to come and witness it too. It was astonishing to watch, the scorpion kept trying to sting the spider’s abdomen, but the spider was so big its legs kept the scorpion away. Over the next few minutes though, the spider began to tire. It was very sad to watch, the scorpion was victorious. The spider was left dying just a few inches from the burrow, and the scorpion entered the hole and took possession of it for itself. I carried on watching with my friend, the scorpion began to use the burrow as a base to hunt, lying in wait and then emerging to grab termites that were passing by. I felt so sad as I had lost my spider friend, but I also felt I’d witnessed something really remarkable. These, to us, small creatures, were mighty titans when in battle with one another, and I had, had absolutely no idea how their fight would end.\n\nSo this competition was between a scorpion and a tarantula. It took place on the plains of South Africa in the dark of night and the scorpion was triumphant. It was horrifying, but exciting to watch because it was a battle to the death and silly as it sounds, I felt like I ‘knew’ one of the competitors. Witnessing it gave me a renewed appreciation of the natural world and its wonders. What a remarkable place we inhabit, and what extraordinary creatures live alongside us the world over!"

    "Answer": "I love to watch sports than participating in it. Whenever I get a chance, I do not miss the events. Recently I became the witness of an interesting horse racing competition in Singapore. I am really glad to have a discussion on the issue. \n\nHorse racing is an exciting sporting event. Usually, horses are deployed in a racing track while they are run by jockeys. The horse jockeys try to cover a distance with the respective horse. Many of the viewers place their bets on the horses they think will win. In fact, betting is the greatest attraction of this sports. But there are some other audiences like me who come only to enjoy the sports and be the part of the excitement. The race usually takes place at the day and evening times with the participation of a number of racing horses. The fastest horse wins the race. \n\nI enjoyed the sport at the Singapore Racecourse. This is a great place for horse racing and comes with different features. The racing ground is wide enough to hold a notable number of horse and riders on the race track. During the race, the entire racing venue burst into excitement. The spectators cheer up the preferred horses and riders. Almost everyone present at the venue shouts at the top of the voice and pray for their success. This is really an incredible view to enjoy. I went in the evening, right before the start of a race. Though it had some highly attractive bets, I resisted myself from placing the bets. In fact, I know it is really difficult to get rid of the gamble if it is set in the mind. After the entrance, I took my seat and enjoyed the thrilling sport. \n\nThere were 12 participants altogether in the race. Each of the horses had different names. One of the horse, named Thunderbolt, won the race. It was really unimaginable that this horse will be the winner. In fact, the horse did not have a better performance at the beginning of the race. The majority of the spectators placed their bets on some other horses and among them, the Stallion was a prominent one. In fact, the horse won few other races as well in the past week. Besides, the rider was also an expert and had nice coordination with Stallion. But the scenario changed in the last lap. Thunderbolt moved ahead with great speed. And it happened suddenly. \n\nThe race was really exciting for some reasons. Actually, I have never seen such races before my eyes. My visit to Singapore has brought the chance to observe the race. Before entering into the racing ground, I heard a huge noised coming out of the ground. So, I entered there with the intention to stay for a few minutes and observe the situations. But I could not move from my seat due to the attraction of the sport. The entire sport was filled with thrills and excitement. People were shouting loud in groups to inspire their respective horses and riders. The supports of Thunderbolt were excited than anyone else in the ground and gallery as the horse won the race. The horse race was thrilling indeed for me."

    "Answer": "When we think or talk about a handsome man, the names of some really famous Hollywood actors come to our mind. Therefore, it is really difficult to come out of that mindset when describing a handsome man, just as it is difficult for me now.\n\nAnyway, the handsome person, I want to talk about today, is nobody else other than my own cousin. This cousin of mine is in his early 40’s and is more than 10 years older than me. But, even though, he is older than me, we have a very special relationship between us since we both treat each other like a real friend and real brother. Anyway, so why I think of my cousin as a handsome person? Well, it is certainly not because he has a flat, solid-looking and fat-free abdomen, with a height of 6 feet, and has some nicely trimmed dark hair, but because he always likes to carry himself like a real and confident person.\n\nAnyway, I have known this person for the last 25 years or so, but seldom have I seen him without a happy face. Besides, I have always found him to be a very active person since I have hardly ever seen him indulging in unproductive things. Of course, when I say that he hardly ever involves himself in doing “unproductive” things, I don’t necessarily mean that he doesn’t socialize with friends or families or enjoy his life, but what I mean to say that he knows his priorities perfectly well. And as far as the looks of this “handsome” person are concerned, he is barely 5’8” tall, with a slightly darker complexion, and has two curious eyes which always radiate with some kind of “intelligence”.  \n\nWell, I think that my cousin certainly is a handsome person, mainly because he knows exactly how to carry himself like a confident person and be a perfect gentleman. What makes him even more “handsome” in my opinion is that he hardly ever looks sad or depressed, even when facing real difficulties in life."

    "Answer": "Irene, a friend of my elder sister, is both beautiful and handsome whom I know for a long. Her full name is Irene Chemo and she works in a multinational company as a senior executive. She is 5 feet 9, has a slender body and a great complexion. On top of that, she has a great fashion sense and her intelligence and amiable personality make her even more handsome. As I heard from my sister, Irene once won an award for the extraordinary performance in a fashion design competition. In my opinion, she is a rare combination of beauty, intelligence, fashion sense, sense of humour and kindness.\n\nIrene is my sister's school friend and I know her from my early childhood. She often comes to our house and I have been to her house on several occasions. She lives with her parents and three other siblings. She is 26 and last year she finished her  graduation. Now she is working full full-time in a large company and planning to establish a small coffee shop near her house. She has asked my sister to be her business partner.\n\nIrene is undoubtedly a beautiful person - both in appearance and in thoughts. She has got the kind of look that can be described as unique and elegant. I guess she could have easily become a renowned model in our country. Her sense of fashion is quite fabulous and most importantly, her higher IQ makes her stand out of the crowd. Furthermore, she is kind and helpful and her amiable and affectionate behaviours make her even more likeable. Her innocent look and the distinctive fashion sense are worth noticing. For all these reasons, I like her very much and have picked her for this cue card topic.\n\nI believe the definition of the term 'smart' or 'handsome' is not that straightforward and someone's intelligence is equally important to become handsome as much as his or her physical appearance is. From this regards, Irene is smart, good looking and handsome."

    "Answer": "Thank you for allowing me to discuss the topic. Since my birth, I have met a good number of people but none of them is as beautiful as my mum is. She is the most beautiful lady I have ever seen in my life. And I am really happy to have the chance of introducing her to you.\n\nMy mum, Rini Mutsoku is a striking lady. She loves her family much and been caring for the family for a long time. She is well-educated and has completed her MA in social science. She is smart, intelligent and owns a pretty look with her dashing eyes. She is in her middle age now and used to be a teacher in a local school here in Japan. She left the job a couple of years ago and turned into a full-fledged homemaker. She has a distinctive style of cooking and she can cook different sorts of traditional foods. In fact, she has got training on cooking.   \n\nI am a young lady and have completed my graduation from the University of Tokyo. Rini Mutsoku is my mum and I have a very intimate bonding with her since after my birth. Though I am not the only daughter to her, she loves me much being the youngest one. But she tries to take care properly for each of the members. She arranges for everything to run the household. My dad is also happy with her efforts and often tries to help her in domestic chores. Being a fresh graduate, it is not possible for me to help her in all such activities as I am busy with searching for jobs and interviews across the city. Besides, my other siblings are also busy with their respective activities. Hence, it is my mum who is to take care of everything at the home.\n\nThe early life of my parents was not so good. In fact, they had to struggle a lot to come in the current position. Life was challenging for them, especially for my mum. Her parents did not want her to get married to my dad for some reasons. At that time, dad was not too much wealthy but he had potentials. After lots of struggles and challenges, both of them got married and started their life together. She continued caring for the home and teaching simultaneously. When my elder two brothers were born, she had to struggle more for taking care of her boys. She also had to suffer for me in my childhood. But now all the sufferings are gone.\n\nMy mum is beautiful in many aspects. Firstly, she has a beautiful mind filled with kindness. She loves to help others. Her beauty lies in her mind. Of course, she has fair skin but it does not reflect her inner beauty. I have had close contacts with her numerous times and discovered her inner self. She is a lovely lady of around 40 and loves to socialise. Almost everyone loves her for her benevolent nature. Besides, she is extremely caring for us. When I was a kid, she used to teach me a different course with outstanding examples. And now I realise how adorable she is. She has managed everything, made the family relations stronger, smartly handled all the distressful moments and more other issues. So, I think she is a beautiful lady in all terms."

    "Answer": "Today I am going to talk about my dream job for the future. I am going to tell you what the job is, the sort of experience and qualifications I might need to do it, then what it involves including what might be the most difficult thing about the job. I think it will be pretty obvious why it is my dream job, but I’ll explain that too. My dream job would be to be a travel writer!\n\nTravel writers are often self-employed. They travel the world to interesting places and then write magazine, newspaper and internet articles about their experiences. In terms of qualifications, I think that’s less important than having a portfolio of examples of your work that show you are a really good writer. Having said that, possibly qualifications that provide a good basic level of English language are useful, and maybe even creative writing or journalism courses might help you to build confidence and develop a writing style\n\nTo do this job you have to be willing to go to lots of new places. You also need to be able to write fluently and in different styles for different publications. Travel writers must be very flexible, as you might need to go to difficult or uncomfortable places and to travel at short notice.  \n\nThe most difficult part of the job? Well, it’s not very well paid, so often travel writers need to have another job a well, because, unfortunately, you can’t really make a living out of this type of work. Also, even if you are successful, it would be quite an unsettling way to live, it would be hard to maintain friends and pursue hobbies if you are moving around all the time … mind you, I think that would be a small price to pay to be part of such a fantastically interesting and stimulating profession!\n\nThe reason I would like to do this job so much is that I love going to new places. For example, earlier this year I got to go to Vietnam to work as a TEFL teacher, that was a new and wonderful experience for me. I would so enjoy telling other people what it was like and encouraging them to go on an adventure of their own. I also like communicating ideas in writing, it would be wonderful to make a living out of the two things I enjoy most – travel and writing!\n\nUnfortunately, there are very few opportunities to make a living as a travel writer, so I think it might have to stay as my dream Job, rather than my actual job! Even so, I think it is important to have a dream, because otherwise how can you ever have a dream come true!"

    "Answer": "To tell the truth, I am reasonably happy with my current job, but it never really hurts to think about a “dream job” once in a while, does it?\n\nAnyway, the dream job, I want to have, is the job of a Medical Doctor. Interestingly enough though, when I was a young student, the medical profession never really appealed me, probably because it involved too much study time and very little fun time. Of course, my parents urged me to become a medical doctor at some point of time, when I was a junior college student, but I chose to ignore their suggestion because I rather wanted to be a business administration and management personnel.\n\nSo, I eventually finished my MBA before joining a very prestigious multi-national firm in my country. But, anyway, while, so far, I have enjoyed my career as a top manager at a corporation, I feel like I could probably offer a lot more as a doctor to my community. But, of course, it never is an easy proposition because I would have to go back to school again in order to finish at least a 5/6 years of medical school. Then, I would also need to work as a resident or intern for at least a year before qualifying for a medical practice license.\n\nAfter all, healing sick people and give them a new and healthy life never is an easy job by any stretch imagination. But, above everything else, I think that the most difficult thing about this job would be to remain patient at all times since it is a matter of life and death for a person.\n\nAnyway, I consider this to be my dream job, mainly because perhaps no other jobs in this world draws as much appreciation and gratitude from another fellow human being as the job of a medical doctor. It is my dream job also because it would always allow me to learn new things about human life, the most fascinating subject of all."

    "Answer": "My dream job? Easy. I’d like to work in wildlife conservation. I’ve thought about it quite a lot, so I can tell you all about the qualifications and experience that can help you get a ‘foot in the door’ what the job might involve and the difficult parts of it too. I’ll try and explain why it would be, for me anyway, a dream come true to be doing it.\n\nThere are lots of different ways to be involved in wildlife conservation all over the world. You might be trying to save rhinos from being poached in South Africa, or looking after injured wildlife like hedgehogs or foxes in the UK. Wherever you want to work, and whether it is with just one species (like elephants) or whole ecosystems (like keeping the arctic or desert free from the impact of man) a lot of the principles are the same. You have to demonstrate commitment through practical experience. In practice, this means volunteering. It might be helping with a local conservation charity, maintaining woodland habitats for example by removing non-native species and keeping trees healthy through appropriate pruning. It could be volunteering in a more hands-on way with animals, helping care for seabirds affected by oil pollution, or it might be through looking after other mammals, working at a riding stable or farm. This experience shows that you quite literally don’t mind getting your hands dirty and have some physical stamina too –working outdoors for wildlife conservation can take you to some quite demanding environments, and it is hard work. However, as well as this practical experience, qualifications are helpful too.\n\nEnvironmental qualifications help you understand how habitats and ecosystems fit together. Science courses in biology and botany help enormously, but so too might a politics or economics course. If you take the example of rhino poaching this is not a ‘simple’ matter of protecting individual animals or even their habitats, it is also about understanding the global business of dealing in rhino horn, why it is in demand and how this demand might be stopped. Fundraising skills are needed, and IT and communication skills too to help charities and NGOs explain their causes. Wildlife conservation is a multi-disciplinary endeavour, many people are needed, from different countries too.\n\nIn terms of what the job involves, it can be very diverse. It involves all aspects of managing and protecting the local environment wherever in the world that might be. It could be educating local people about their wildlife and encouraging them to understand why it is important to preserve it. It might involve practically managing the habitat, planting trees or clearing paths.  It could involve observation and monitoring to see what wildlife is present and whether or not populations are thriving or struggling.  It could be working in a remote island or forest locations, or in more urban habitats where the interests of wildlife and people clash as their territory encroaches on one another.\n\nThe role is exciting, but I think it could be really difficult too.  Many animals are at risk of extinction and sadly not all people want to preserve them.  It would be heart-breaking to work to protect an animal, like a rhino and then to have it poached and killed just for its horn.  It must take enormous tenacity to pick yourself up and keep on going after a setback like that, and yet that is what is happening all the time to people in South Africa working to protect the precious few rhinos that are left. I also think it would be very difficult when the interests of people are at odds with those of animals and the wild environment. In some parts of the world, animals are really threatened – like the gorillas in Rwanda, who are terribly endangered. However, the people who live around the forests which the gorillas inhabit are themselves suffering. They have endured war and poverty, they too need the resources of the forests in order to survive. That is a truly difficult test for conservationists. How to protect the animals but look after local people with justice and compassion too. If my family were starving I would see that as a greater immediate priority than saving a gorilla I had never seen, but the crisis for the gorillas is real all the same. Solutions that help both man and wildlife to thrive alongside one another (maybe through tourism, so people benefit from the continuation of the species) are most needed.\n\nI think it would be a really interesting role to help preserve rare and endangered species for future generations in their natural habitats rather than just in zoos. For me, a ‘dream job’ would be one that I could be proud to say I did, and which in some small way made the world a better place for my time spent on it. However, I think it would be a troubled dream because it is a very difficult one to succeed in. I think sometimes trying to save animals from extinction is as futile as trying to hold back the tide of the seas, however, I still think it is important to try. If we give up now then extinction is the only possible outcome, if we all keep on trying to preserve habitats and the animals that live within them, perhaps we can have a brighter future for us all?"

    "Answer": "Everyone dream to have a good job. I am not an exception in this case. I also have a dream job and it is to be a well-reputed banker. Thank you for expressing my about my dream job and I will describe it in brief here.  \n\nUsually, a banker needs to have some special degrees in Finance or Management. An MBA is a suitable one. Further, there are some other professional courses are also available like Bank Management etc. to reach the job. I have completed my MBA and pursuing another degree to make my dream come true. But it is really difficult for a woman to achieve her dream job and this is for extensive competitions in the sector. A large number of women like me are after the job and hence the scopes are limited. However, I am trying my best to reach the goal and someday I definitely will be with my dream.  \n\nThe job would involve a good number of tasks and responsibilities. In fact, there is no specific limit for the job but there are some ideas about it. I think the job might want me to do some of the documenting of the clients’ transactions, assist is the account opening with the bank, distribution of money to the clients or the real owner and more other. In fact, I have to remain busy round the day with numerous types of works and responsibilities. Sometimes, I may need to move out of the bank for some official purposes. The bank may also send me to get training on other banking issues. Arranging for remittance transfer and monitoring online transactions etc. are some of the notable tasks that a banker needs to do usually. There might be some exceptions as well. So, I am preparing for the responsibilities.\n\nThe most difficult thing about the job is to get it. Generally, banks recruit with recruitment examinations. The candidates have to appear in the recruitment exams, and then they are asked for formal interviews with the authority (if they can pass the written tests). Finally, the recruitment is completed. But this is not as easy as it sounds. The recruitment test takes place for hours. It needs lots of preparations. In fact, applicants who are weak in mathematics and accounting are unable to pass the tests. Besides, the test also comes with analytical ability analysis. As a candidate, you need to pass all the segments. Then comes the oral test. The Human Resource department is responsible for arranging the written and oral tests. If I can cross both the barriers, I can have the job.   \n\nBaking is my dream job for several reasons. First of all, this is a secured job. I know there are lots of troubles with this profession, but there are fewer chances of losing the job. Besides, the remuneration that I will get is smart enough to lead a decent life. Moreover, I like to have some challenges in my career and profession. Banking is one of the professions that comes with some specific set of challenges. As a woman, I am able to undertake them and could exercise my mental faculty to the largest extent. Based on the grounds, banking has become my dream job."

    "Answer": "I live in a wonderful country with some really beautiful tourist spots to visit. Even the town, in which I live now, is considered to be a wonderful tourist spot by many because of its many ancient buildings and a very large but beautiful lake. But, today, here I would like to talk about a tourist site which is not from my city.\n\nThis tourist site, I visited, is called “Galle” which is known to be one of the major cities of Sri Lanka. Located on the southwest coast of the country, this city attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year from all around the world. It attacks so many tourists because of its perfect mixture of history, culture and fun activities. Interestingly enough though, I had very little idea about this fortified old city from 16th century up until I visited this place about a couple of years ago at the invitation of one of my old friends (from high school) who is running a restaurant business there. But, anyway, I am really glad that I visited this tourist site with a cousin of mine and learned a lot of things about a great country like Sri Lanka.\n\nAfter visiting this city, which also was the key trading port for thousands of years between east and west, the first thing I did there was to visit the “Jungle beach” which I thought was one of the least crowded beaches in the world with a stunning view of the ocean. Later in the afternoon, we also visited the magnificent Galle fort which certainly was the highlight of the town’s many tourist attraction. We also visited a couple of cafes there in order to enjoy some of the finest Sri Lankan cuisines.\n\nAnyway, I felt really great and relaxed after visiting this old and historic city for a change. Besides, mingling with the locals there certainly provided a great window of opportunity for us to learn about the rich culture and traditions of the Sri Lankan people."

    "Answer": "Thank you a lot for this nice candidate task card topic. I would now talk about a tourists site which is not located in my city and where I have been to with my wife.\n\nLast year I went to Kuala Lumpur Bird Park in Malaysia with my wife and this was an excellent tourist site. As the name of the park suggests, Kuala Lumpur Bird Park is located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was probably the early November, last year when I had been there. I visited this park with my wife and her excitement was quite fabulous. She is very fond of birds and being in a park which was entirely dedicated to different bird species was a breathtaking experience for her. I have never been to such a place before and I thoroughly enjoyed the hours I spent there.\n\nThe total park area must have been more than 20 acres and I guess there were more than 200 different bird species and more than 3000 birds in total. I heard from a tour guide that more than two hundred thousand visitors visit this park each year. This is probably a popular tourist spot in Kuala Lumpur city as the 'Google Search Engine' brought this place in search results every time I searched for popular tourist spots in Kuala Lumpur.  \n\nI was very excited to be there. The time we spent in Malaysia was marvellous and the park made it even more enchanting. In our country, we have many zoological gardens and parks but not a single one which is totally dedicated to the birds. It was an exceptional and enthralling experience for me to watch so many birds in a single park.\n\nI was very much amazed by the beautiful flora and fauna that have made the park a worth visiting tourist spot. This was indeed a great place to observe the activities of birds in their natural habitat. We went to the park by a tourist bus and noticed that some of the tourists were going there for the second time and a few of them were researchers and research scientists. The peacocks of various species were so beautiful that most of the tourists took their pictures. This park was a great place to be and I took many photos on my camera and tried to save the memory."

    "Answer": "My last trip to Australia was outstanding. I had visited some of the most notable tourist spots in the country, and Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of them. In fact, I liked the Bridge the most. This is one of the most splendid structures I have ever seen.\n\nThe bridge is located in Sydney Harbour. It is responsible for carrying different types of vehicles including rails, cars and even bicycles. Besides, the bridge also has a provision for pedestrians. This is a magnificent bridge located near the Sydney Opera House and also named as Coathanger. The naming is done for its design that resembles an arch. Vehicular movement is done between the North Shore and the central business district of Sydney. The bridge provides a striking view of the Sydney Harbour. The entire structure is made of steel and one of the tallest one on the earth. The maximum height of the bridge is about 134 meters.\n\nI am a businessman in Japan. I have a business of electronic goods. I need to move to different countries to make deals with my suppliers and clients. As part of my business trip, I went to Australia in November last. It was really an outstanding trip. I made some new deals with the existing clients in Australia. Besides, there were some issues with product quality. I discussed the matters with the producers and they assured me to take steps on providing the best quality products. Further, they did not have any return policy for me. I also placed the issue which meeting with them. They assured me to think about the return policy. Often it happens that some of the products become defective in different terms. Some get damaged while packing and some others have manufacturing defects. So, it becomes hard for me to sell the products to the end-level users. Overall, it was a successful business trip for me.   \n\nSince it was about business deals, I took my general manager with me to accompany. He is also a smart and intelligent individual and owns years of experience in dealing with such critical issues. Both of us made meetings with the suppliers. Once the meeting was over, we made short trips inside the city. As part of such a trip, I went to see the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Adjacent to the Sydney Opera House, the Bridge comes with two railway lines and eight lanes for vehicular movement. In fact, the Bridge is now a famous tourist attraction in Australia for the outsiders. This is an impressive steel structure and was made in 1932.\nI felt a deep sense of joy after seeing this large steel-made bridge. Walking on the Bridge was a splendid experience for me. When I ascended the top of the Bridge, the views appeared completely different than it was from the ground level. It was in the evening when I ascended on the top and found that the entire harbour, and the city was shining with bright lights. The natural view was also stunning, especially the sunset scene. This was really a memorable experience for me."

    "Answer": "There are different kinds of wild animals in my country which deserve special attention because of their unique characteristics. But, today here, I would like to talk about a rather common wild animal which I have seen many times before from up close.\n\nThe name of this wild animal is “Fox”. Some people also like to call it “red fox” because of its generally reddish coat. Like all “Canids” (a biological family of dog-like carnivorans), foxes have a rather slender appearance, pointed ears and an elongated muzzle. Its back of the ears and the front of the legs are black while its throat and belly can be from white to grey. One of the most noticeable characteristics of the red fox is that it has a fluffy white-tipped tail which actually looks like a “brush”.\n\nAnyway, these small to medium-sized mammals, with a height of about 35 to 50 centimetre at shoulder, can be found across the entire Northern Hemisphere including most of North America, Europe and Asia, plus parts of Northern Africa. However, even if it can survive almost in any kinds of environment, it just doesn’t do too well in the tropical climates. Foxes in my country eat almost any food type, from insects, birds, and small mammals to sunflower seeds. They truly are some opportunistic eaters.\n\nBy the way, the red fox is generally portrayed as a sly, cunning creature and has been symbolised in folklore across the world for centuries, which usually live in diverse habitats including forests, grasslands, and mountainous areas of my country. These red foxes can also be seen in human environments such as farms, suburban areas, and even large communities.  \n\nPeople in my country generally try to avoid them, but don’t necessarily like them or fear them, mainly because these animals have almost no or very little impact on their day to day lives. Having said that, however, most people in my country consider this wild creature as some devious and crafty animals which certainly know how to stay alive."

    "Answer": "I live in England in the United Kingdom, and you might think we don’t have many wild animals, but in fact, we do. They are generally quite small and elusive, but lovely nevertheless, and they feature in lots of children’s stories.  Perhaps you’ll have heard of Beatrix Potter? She wrote beautifully illustrated books for children which were based on her imagined adventures for creatures from our countryside like rabbits, hedgehogs and even toads.\n\nI’m going to tell you about one of my favourite wild animals from my country. I’ll explain what it is, and what it looks like. Where it lives – though that is quite complicated.  What I like about it and a bit about how others feel about them. You will find there are very different views! The animal I am thinking of is about the size of a domestic cat, though in appearance it more resembles a dog.  It has a reddish coat and a long bushy tail, called a ‘brush’ which always has a white tip to it. They vary a little in colour, but often have a white underbelly, and attractive black markings at the edge of their pointed ears. Can you guess what it is?  A red fox!\n\nAs to where foxes generally live, that is quite interesting. Historically, they were a feature of the countryside. People think of them as carnivores, meat-eaters, but in fact, they are omnivores. They do need a certain amount of prey, and will typically eat rabbits, birds, shrews and mice, for which they hunt,  as well as insects, berries, eggs and carrion (any dead animals they come across). However, they are also clever opportunists, so in the countryside, they will take domestic poultry if they can. In the countryside, they can come into conflict with farmers if they get into a chicken shed, they react to the panicking hens and can kill every bird in the hen house though only eating one. They aren’t popular on large estates where landowners raise pheasants for shooting. They have come to be regarded as something of a pest in the countryside, though not by everyone. Until quite recently it was legal to hunt foxes with dogs – I don’t agree with hunting at all, it horrifies me to think of a mob of people on horseback running down a solitary fox with a pack of dogs. I don’t agree with shooting pheasants either, a horrible so-called ‘sport’. Because foxes have been quite persecuted in the countryside, they have increasingly moved into urban areas. They are very resourceful and adaptable and actually have done really well living in towns and cities alongside people.  In this environment they are largely scavengers, raiding bins, eating discarded food from shops and restaurants, and living alongside railway tracks where there is still some cover of vegetation in which they can build dens.\n\nThe urban fox is doing so well, they are really common, and probably more now live in the towns than in the countryside. They are more active at dusk perhaps, but it is relatively easy to spot them. I think they are really beautiful, and I find it extraordinary that such a relatively large mammal can live alongside people in such a seemingly unpromising environment. They are so habituated to people they can become quite bold. They are still wild animals, and should not be regarded as tame, but they will come quite close. Where my parents live a fox used to regularly stop by their garden every evening to see if any food had been left out. Lots of people leave scraps out for ‘their’ foxes, as you might put out seeds to feed the birds that visit your garden. The fox always came at the same time, so my parents started to sit out and wait for it, and the fox would come within a couple of feet of them. It came so frequently, it wore a track in the lawn so you could see its exact route across the garden.  Even if you can’t see foxes, you can hear them at night calling. The sound is quite alarming if you haven’t heard it before. They give out a range of calls, but sometimes it can be mistaken for someone screaming.  It’s quite something!\n\nPeople have very different views about foxes. Some people regard them as pests that take livestock in the countryside and upturn rubbish bins in the city. Others, like me, treasure this beautiful creature. I have seen the damage foxes can cause to a hen house, and it is bad, but they are wild animals acting on instinct, you just have to make sure your poultry sheds are fox-proof as best you can. I feel really privileged that even in the midst of a city you might catch a glimpse of a fox at night, loping along. Where I live now, after it snows, I can see fox tracks in the garden.  I find it comforting that even though these animals are so persecuted in some rural areas, they have found a way to adapt and survive. They are glorious to behold and give me hope that endangered as many species are, foxes at least have found a way to endure!"

    "Answer": "Wildlife is one of the most important resources for Sweden. This is the place where a notable number of wild animals are found. Moose is one of them and it is available across the country. The country has a huge amount of open spaces which helps to nurture the wilderness.\n \nMoose is a superstar in the realm of wild animals in Sweden. This creature belongs to the deer family. But this is not an animal of wild nature. Due to its popularity among the people, its image is found in almost all of the daily activities. The animal comes with a height of around 210 centimetres with an average weight of around 800 KG. Though they are available in the zoo, they look better in the wild. Though the country is filled with this creature, they are not found in the cities more. They love to stay in nature.\n\nIn most of the cases, moose is found in open space out of the city. In fact, they do not want to approach in the city areas as there are numerous risks for them. Besides, when people see those animals in the city, they also take actions against them fearing plagues and other diseases. Hence, nature is the best place for them and they hardly come out of nature. They mostly live in moderate forests. But often they are also found near the towns when they are in search of their foods. Sometimes, they are also seen near and inside the farmlands in search of their foods. Besides, they are also seen on the roads outside of the city while driving a car. But the largest moose will be found at the Sarek National Park located in Lapland of the country.\n\nThis is a very cool creature in the wild. It has some special features like it does no harm to people. It takes vegetables as its food. Besides, it owns no resistance power at all from being trafficked or hunted. Humans are the larger predators for this creature while it also becomes victims of some other wild animals. This is the larger species of the deer family and Sweden contains the largest number of moose here. interestingly, the love to live alone. They do not have any herd or group to stay together. As a result, they are easy targets for predators.  \n\nWe, the Swedish, have a sense of affection to moose. It has occupied a large portion of our life. But some of the people bear a negative attitude about the creature for some mysterious reasons. They do not have any soft feeling for the moose and even they do lack reactions when the animals are hunted down by some cruel hunters. Besides, moose trafficking is another important issue. At times, there are some protests about the trafficking but they are of no use at all. However, moose has a great impact on the mind of the ordinary people. As a result, they are found on the t-shirts, key rings, gloves, on the car bumpers, in the form of stickers etc. This is a kind of expression of love for them."

    "Answer": "I have always admired people who can speak a foreign language other than their native language. Of course, it doesn’t happen often that you get to meet such a person every day. But, I got lucky to meet such a person about a few years ago at an international book fair of my country.\n\nThe person, I am talking about, was a German native who also visited the book fair in order to learn about the popular books and literature of my country. Or so, at least, I thought, as far as his desire to learn about the literature of my country was concerned.\n\nBut, then, when I found him inquiring about our literature, as well as some of the most notable poets and writers of our country, in a foreign language (I mean, my native language), I felt like he was probably trying to offer literature lessons to the bookstall owner, he was talking with, instead of actually learning anything from him.\n\nAnyway, after hearing him speak in such an eloquent manner in my own language, I felt very intrigued and asked him about his country of origin. Later on, of course, I also introduced myself to him and asked questions like what exactly had motivated him to learn such a difficult foreign language, and also how he managed to learn it, in addition to many other questions.\n\nNeedless to say, he answered all those questions in my own language very elaborately – perhaps more elaborately than I could ever do it myself. Anyway, his fluency in a foreign language is certainly unquestionable, but what I liked even more about him was that he considered himself like a true “world citizen” with no attachment to any particular country or culture.\n\nWell, when I asked him how he, as a German native, learned my language, he surprised me by saying that he studied this language at a university in his country. He also told me that he visited my country many times in order to learn its culture, tradition and heritage, and thus understanding the true appeal of my language."

    "Answer": "My Aunt Margarita, who works as a journalist, can speak German very fluently. Margarita is my maternal aunt and she is 29. She is married to a businessman and is the mother of a two years old son.\n\nI know her my whole life. She is only 3 years senior to me and we are very close. She even stayed at our house during her university days. She often helped me with my studies and I liked her due to her ambient nature and remarkable spirit. Since we were at the same university, we often met at the university campus and had our lunch together at a canteen.\n\nAfter Margarita finished her graduation, she went to Munich to complete her post-graduation in journalism. She stayed there for more than 4 years and worked for a daily newspaper as a part-time reporter. I guess this is the time when she learned the German language. As far as I know, she even tried to learn German when she decided to go to Garmany. She is a quick learner and she must have learned the language during her stay in Germany. She still works as an online journalist for an online magazine that offers their news in 5 languages including German.\n\nI believe that learning a second language is always beneficial. It expands our understanding of the country  where this is spoken, about their people, their culture, ways of life and many other aspects. Scientific research also proves that people who can speak multiple languages have a better understanding of foreign cultures and have less prejudice about their own culture. This in a way broadens our mind and ways of thinking. I like it very much that my aunt can speak German very fluently. She is an aspiring journalist and I am sure her talent, dedication and skill in foreign languages will help her ride on the top of her career ladder. Personally, I believe that skills in a foreign language enhance our career prospect and make us wiser and inquisitive about learning."

    "Answer": "Learning is language in a matured age is really difficult. But Mr Christopher David is an extraordinary man who has learnt French and can fluently speak the language. He is an Australian and teaches English at my college here in Delhi.\n\nMr David is a genius with some other extraordinary qualities. He loves to sing and composes music as well. But he is primarily successful as a teacher. He can teach English in a skilled manner which I have never seen before. He is well aware of the pronunciations and regularly takes tests of his students. He is over 6’ and has a smart look. Mr David likes to be formal always and even he is formal at his home as well. Further, he is very kind in nature and always ready to support any of his students. Consequently, he has gained a reputation as a very good teacher in the college.\n\nI got admitted to this college last year and I have a mandatory course in the English language. Mr David was the English teacher for the college and he has been playing the role for a couple of years. it appeared weird to me when I saw him first in the college. Later, I came to know about his identity as a teacher and wanted to attend his class. Fortunately, he was assigned to taking our English class in the first week after admission. I got familiar with him in the class and came to know about him. He described all of his life events in the first class. He also mentioned that he was able to speak fluently in some other languages other than English while the French language was one of them.\n\nI like him very much and really he is adorable. Firstly, he never uses any other language in the class other than English. So, it is a great benefit for me that I could hear English round the class hours. As a result, I have developed an improved hearing of English and can pronounce many words with the exact pronunciation. Besides, Mr David makes the lessons easier. He breaks the lesson into different parts and explains them. He uses plenty of examples to make us understand the lessons and topics. This is a great way to teach and effective as well. Often I had to visit him at his home (he lives nearby to my residence) and found that he is really a cordial individual as he is in the college hours.\n\nWhile having a conversation in the class, he was discussing the use of different language. Gradually, it appeared that how many languages do his students knew. Then he revealed that he knows five languages and French is one of them. He described that he had to learn the langue while he was in France for his career. He wanted to be a painter and thus went to France at the beginning of his career. But unluckily he failed to shine as a professional painter. Then he left the country. He struggled there for over three years before leaving the passion to be a painter. So, he had to learn the language to communicate with the surroundings. So, now he is a fluent speaker of French. But later, he took teaching as his profession and career and been engaged in teaching for seven years last."

    "Answer": "I am no fashionable person by any stretch of the imagination, but I do like to make sure that I feel comfortable and confident with what I am wearing. Of course, there is only one type of clothes, which ensures that for me, and that is my T-shirt.\n\nNow, I am sure that many, many people around the globe prefer to consider T-shirts as their favourite dress, but I don’t think that most of these T-shirt lovers have a story like me behind picking a t-shirt as their favourite piece of clothing or dress.\n\nAnyway, it all started when I was barely an 8 or 9-year-old kid, and my parents had bought some clothes for me and my cousin. Those clothes included few full sleeve shirts, couple of cotton slacks and, of course, a few off white t-shirts. Before that day, my cousin never liked the t-shirt. But, when I took a t-shirt that day and put it on, my cousin felt so happy and excited to see me that he immediately brought our camera and took a picture of me.\n\nFrankly speaking, that was the best picture that someone ever took of me as a kid. Since then, I have worn a t-shirt pretty much all the time, whether I am going to meet a friend, doing some grocery, going to a restaurant or just having a walk in the park. Sometimes, I even wear them when I am attending a formal party or ceremony. Of course, now that I am grown up, I try to buy a t-shirt with a collar of different colours, but the rest of my t-shirt has to be either white or off white.  \n\nAnyway, I like the t-shirt so much, mainly because it is very convenient to use and it certainly makes me feel very comfortable. I like so much also because it compliments my body structure and shape and thus making me look young and fit."

    "Answer": "Oh dear, this is a challenging one for me. I don’t really think about clothes very much, I’m not much of a follower of fashion or a ‘clothes horse’ as the saying goes. I just like to be comfortable, and inconspicuous. Hmm, even so, I’ll think about what I instinctively put on the other day, when I had no particular obligations that required me to dress in a certain way so I just put on exactly what I wanted. There couldn’t be a more accurate way to judge what I really like to wear than that!\n\nIn life, we often have to wear certain things to be acceptable and presentable in particular situations. Of course, I’d wear a suit if I was going to a job interview, and I have been known to put on a dress if I was going to a wedding (though that really isn’t a sight you see very often!) If I’m going for a run, I’ll pull on leggings and a sports top, which is really comfy, but not what I’d wear at home. I’m going to tell you what I wear by choice, what it looks like, how often I wear it and why I like to so much.\n\nI think I must be a bit of an odd shape because I find it really hard to get clothes that fit me well. I’m short, and a bit top heavy, so things that fit the top of my body can swamp my lower half, so I always prefer to wear a separate top and bottom rather than a dress say.  If I’m having an at-home day (that is, a day when no-one will see me and be horrified at how informally I’ve dressed) then I’ll go for what is most comfortable every time. My flat can be really cold, especially at this time of year in the winter, so I like to wear something that is as warm as possible. So, my outfit of choice the other day was a pair of stretchy black pull on jodhpurs with an elasticated waist and a fleece jumper.  The jodhpurs are old and worn but incredibly comfy and roasty toasty warm to wear. I also had on really thick knee length socks, because they are warm too, and the soles of the socks are quite thick, which means I can get away without putting any shoes on if I’m just pottering about at home. I am always more comfortable with bare feet indoors, but just now it’s winter and a bit too cold for that, hence woolly socks are the order of the day. For my top, I pulled on an over-sized fleece. Again, it is lovely and warm and stretchy too. It is also black, so I’m dressed like a stagehand at the theatre! (Perhaps you don’t know, but the people who shift scenery between acts for stage plays are always dressed completely in black so they disappear into the background when they are moving things around.)  I definitely don’t look glamorous and I hope that I won’t have to answer the door to the postman or anyone else as I look a bit of a mess quite frankly. However, if I’m really honest, if I could get away with wearing such casual and comfortable clothes every day then I absolutely would.\n\nSo, when I was getting dressed for an ‘at-home’ day the other week, I didn’t expect I’d be telling you all about my clothing choices now, but somehow, I don’t think I’d get away with pretending I lounge about my flat wearing a ball gown and heels. I’m just not the dressy type.  Others might describe dressing up for a night out, for me, it’s all about dressing down for a night curled up on the sofa with a nice cup of tea!"

    "Answer": "I usually like to wear a pair of jeans pant and a casual T-shirt when I do not need to wear any formal dress. A couple of months ago, I went to Singapore and had bought several pairs of denim jeans pants and five casual T-shirts which had custom designs on them. Now they have turned into my most favourite clothes for me and quite often I wear them. In fact, they give me the freedom of movement and for this cue card topic, I would like to talk about it.\n\nI am a student at college and I ma in second year. Earlier, I used to maintain a formal dress code but now I am a bit different from that view and the change occurred a couple of years ago. Usually, I did not wear jeans and a T-shirt as I did not feel comfortable with them. But now the view has changed and I love to wear them whenever possible. Actually, I did not have any idea about how they felt up until 2014. I saw many of the youths and students in my college wear such dresses. My visit to Singapore and the experience of street shopping has changed the view and I first experienced it in 2013. I actually bought a pair of jeans pants along with two T-shirts based on my curiosity in 2013, but that changed my choice of dressing entirely.\n\nI bought the pair of jeans pant at a reasonable cost after lots of bargaining with the seller. One of the pants is dark blue while the other once comes with a light shade. But both the pants are of standard quality and fabric. Their sewing is strong and durable. The seller assured me that the pants will last longer than my thought. On the other sides, I bought the T-shirt with a fancy look on it. It comes with a deep dark colour. Amid the black shade, there is a quite saying ‘Hi!’ by a cartoon. In fact, the carton looks different and I liked the T-shirt for its stylish collar and design. Usually, I love to wear light colours but this time I have chosen the darker ones as an experiment. I am amazed that the colours suited me perfectly. Now, whenever I shop, I prefer to buy fashionable jeans pants and uniquely designed T-shirts.\n\nWhen I am at home, I do not wear jeans and T-shirts. But when I am out of home for any informal purposes, I wear them. Moreover, when I move to my college, earlier I used to wear formal pants and shirts but now I wear jeans pant with the T-shirt. Sometimes, I interchange with the pants and T-shirts with some other attires as well. Sometimes, I wear a formal shirt with jeans pant or wear a T-shirt with a formal pant. It actually depends on my moods and occasions I have to attend. But both the ways are comfortable for me.\n\nI like the jeans pants and T-shirt so much for some specific reasons. They are comfortable to use. Movement is easier. With a formal dress, it is almost impossible to move easily, and even seating is also difficult. I always had to worry about the clothes I was wearing. Cleaning them is another issue. But there are no such issues with the jeans pants or T-shirt. They do not need any specific cleaning process or specialised water. The most impressive benefit of wearing jeans pant and a T-shirt is that you can have access to any occasion or events you want. They are always appropriate and nobody will have any objection on the dress. Hence, the youths around the world are wearing jeans pants and casual T-shirts. I am planning to have many more jeans pants and casual T-shirts soon."

    "Answer": "There is no doubt that home certainly is one of the best places, if not the best, for our relaxation. But, outside of the home, there are also some other good places for relaxing, and today, I would like to highlight one of them.\n\nThe place, I would like to talk about, is a beautiful looking public park, which is about 10 kilometres away from the place where I live. Although people like to call it a public park, I consider it to be more like a mini botanical garden which has pretty much all the ingredients of relaxation.\n\nIn fact, with its 20 plus acres of forestation, a rose garden, a few tower-like observatories, and plenty of spots to hideaway from it all, it is very much like a haven for the nature lovers. But, if these things are not enough to help someone relax, a few natural canals with crystal clear in them will certainly make him or her fall in love with this place. By the way, a park with an area of 20 plus acres of land just may not sound too big of an area, but since everything in this park is placed and organized in such close proximity and in a beautiful manner that one would never get bored after spending hours at this place.\n\nMoreover, you can do a lot in this park in order to relax here, from taking small walks in it to checking its beautiful rose garden to just sitting on the benches there and read some good books. Besides, you can also watch some live music concerts, organized by some local bands, if you are visiting it at the weekend.\n\nAnyway, I think that it is a good place for relaxing because it certainly brings very close to mother nature while forgetting about the stress of my day to day life. It is a good place for relaxation also because this is where I can be a “person of my own” without worrying about the undue attention from others."

Without any doubt, most of the people would consider their home for the ideal place to relax. I would also agree with them but this cue card topic specifically  instructs to pick a different place than my home. Well, a park which is located near my home, in my opinion, is also a very good place to relax.\n\nThe park I am talking about is called (...give a park's name which is located near your home...) and it takes only 15 minutes for me to reach there from my home. This is a beautiful park and I feel quite relaxed there. Every time I go there, I feel a different kind of peace that the busy city, where I live in, rarely offers. The scenic beauty, the large lake, places for a picnic, boat rides, green vista, harmonic songs of nature, the chirping of the birds, sweet aroma of  different flowers make it a paradise. Interestingly this place is preferred by many young artists and it is quite common to spot an artist busy in his work inside this park.\n\nUsually, I go there to walk or to get away from the crowd. It is also a good place to read books or newspapers. I often take a book and read under one of the large trees. When I go there with my friends, I mostly prefer to sit beside the lake and gossip with them. The total area of the park is more than 100 acres and it is maintained by the Metropolitan Park Authority.\n\nThe busy city has very fewer places like this one. Once inside, I can forget the busy schedule, think clearly, concentrate on revising my plans, breathe fresh air, sit in a silent corner of the park and can read books or a magazine without any interruption. It might sound a bit awkward but I one spelt there under a tree. I was quite stressed out and tired after a long and busy day. On my way home, I went to this park and sat under a tree. After a while, I fall asleep. I have never told about this anyone. Probably you are the first person I am telling this and to explain how good a place this is!\n\nThe beautiful trees, sweet gentle breeze, symphonious ripples on the lake and various beautiful birds make it an ideal place to remain close to nature, think about ourselves without any disturbance, relax our mind and get away from the monotonous city life. I know this park for a long time and I have been there countless times. This is an excellent place where I can relax and I believe I will go there many more times as long as I live in this city."

    "Answer": "Relaxation is one of the greatest demands for people and they need it indeed to remain active and vigorous in their day to day life. I also have a place for relaxation and the place is a public library. I love to spend time here by reading different books which makes me feel relaxed.\n\nIt may sound weird to many that I go to a library for relaxation despite numerous other methods. But the preference for relaxation differs from person to person. I love to read books in a quiet place. Accordingly, a library is a right place for me. The New Orleans Public Library is just a few blocks away from my home and I often visit the place to read books. In fact, this is the only place in the entire city where I can have some quietness.\n\nThis is a large place. It appears to me that the entire history of humanity and civilization is kept in the books on the shelves. The library also comes with some other features. There are plenty of spaces to take a book and start reading them. It really looks good to see a large number of books well decorated on the huge shelves. Besides, the variety of books is another interesting issue. Almost all types of books are available here. This is like a heavenly place where everyone is busy with reading books. The seating arrangements are also fine and comfortable. I love the way to collect books and borrow them for reading at home as well.  \n\nMy initial purpose is to read books at the library. But there are some preconditions to read inside the library. This is the place where nobody is allowed to break the silence. If I need something or to do something else, I need to do it silently. I love the way of working in a silent manner. Besides, I am also allowed to borrow books of my interest. I am a member of this public library and often bring books at home which I cannot finish reading in the library. Further, I am happy to have this library adjacent to me as I do not need to spend more time visiting the place. I can reach the library within a few minutes from my residence. Sometimes, I take light snacks from the coffee shop inside the library. But mostly I spend time reading there and it is in the evening.\n\nThis is a good place from many perspectives. Firstly, this is an interesting place to sit and relax with books. While reading books, I feel a sense of peace inside me. In fact, reading books brings inner peace and satisfies the mind. Besides, there are a variety of books available and I can take any one of them after my taste. I also like the environment of the library. Everyone is busy with their respective activities. There is no chaos but everything is running smoothly inside the building without any noise. Besides, this is a very good place to relax and anyone can read books as long as they want before the closure of the library. Considering all such benefits and features, this is a good place for relaxation for me."

    "Answer": "This is an easy, peasy topic for me to talk about! I can think of one particular situation that stands out in my memory when I bumped into someone totally unexpectedly, and in the most unlikely of situations. I’m going to enjoy telling you all about it, though I wonder if I’ll be able to convey to you exactly how bizarre it was that we met again in the way that we did.  I’ll explain who I met, when, where, what we were doing, and why it was such a big surprise for both of us.\n\nSo the person I met was someone I’d been at school with. Now, for this story to make sense you have to know that I left school about thirty years ago, so I hadn’t seen this friend since the day we finished our exams three decades earlier. We were friendly at school, but not enough to keep in touch after we left, and as so often happens we went our different ways and had no idea at all what had happened to one another in the years that followed.\n\nA few years ago, I moved to Sheffield to take up a new job. I didn’t know the city or anyone in it. After I’d been there a couple of years, I decided I needed to get fit, and so when I heard about a local free 5km running event that took place every Saturday in a park near to where I lived I plucked up the courage to give it a go. Now, this was a really unlikely thing for me to do. I had never run before in my life, and it was not at all my natural habitat. I wasn’t very fast, but I did get round and in a peculiar way I enjoyed it enough that I went back again the following week.\n\nTo my absolute amazement, it was at this return visit that I spotted a familiar face in the crowd of nearly 500 runners.  Someone I recognised from school! The weird thing was that I didn’t even know she’d also moved to Sheffield (we both went to school just outside London which is 200 miles away), what’s more, neither of us was remotely sporty at school, so seeing her there, so far from where we used to live, doing such an unlikely activity as running and recognising her after thirty years in such a big crowd was extraordinary! Even more amazingly, I just went up to her and said ‘hello Delia’ and she replied ‘hello Lucy’ and we just knew each other straight away.\n\nWe were both amazed! We went off to have breakfast together and talked solidly for over three hours. (It was a long breakfast!). It turned out she’d moved to Sheffield straight after doing her A-levels, so had lived here for years and years, and what’s more, her house was just a couple of miles away from the flat I was renting. We seemed to pick up exactly where we’d left off. Better than that really. We now meet up to run and then have breakfast together every week, but we also do other things like go to the cinema or theatre together. I help her with her allotment sometimes and she has been a great friend to me.\n\nI feel so lucky that this unlikely and unexpected meeting helped me to reconnect with a good friend from the past. It goes to show it pays to have your eyes peeled and your wits about you when you are out and about – you never know who you might encounter unexpectedly and where it might lead! ‘Surprise’ isn’t quite a big enough word for how I felt spotting her, but I’m so glad I did."

    "Answer": "My cousin has been living in another city for a long time now because of his profession. But, of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean that we don’t keep in touch with each other on telephone or email as often as we can. After all, we are very close to each other since we grew up together.  In fact, I called him only a few days ago to check how his newly-bought car was running.\n\nTalking about a car, I also wanted to buy a used car (yes, I have always had a used car because I can’t really afford a new car like my rich cousin, who likes to change his car every few years) about a couple of years ago since my old car was giving me lots of troubles on the road. So, I called my cousin and explained my situation to him since I thought that he was the best person to offer me some good tips and advice on buying a reliable used car because of his passion about those machines.\n\nAnyway, he asked me about what kind of cars I preferred and what my price range was. After getting the information from me, he just hung up the phone and told me that he was going to call me back a few days later. But, instead of actually calling me after a few days, he came to see me at my home when I was just sitting and relaxing there, and with him was a nice little hatchback which he had purchased for me.\n\nNeedless to say, I was very surprised to see my cousin at that time. In fact, it was beyond my belief that he would actually drive about 10 hours, and that too on a very dangerous driving condition since it was raining very heavily on that day, to see me in a car, which he had bought for me. After all, he was a very busy person, who needed to work even on most of the weekends."

    "Answer": "Meeting with people is interesting to me, especially when I meet people who were or are usually close to me. But suddenly meeting with a familiar one in a different place is more interesting and this is surprising as well. I met with Mr. David Johnson, my former teacher in Australia, at a shopping mall here in Tokyo, Japan and for this cue card topic, I would like to share this experience with you.\n \nIn fact, I was a student of arts in Australia at the University of South Australia. I went there with a scholarship for higher education. Mr. Johnson was the associate professor of English literature there. I had close contact with him while my study in Australia. But after I came back to Japan, my native land, the communications were a bit slower. Actually, I did not have any communication with the university anymore. So, there was a huge communication gap between me and my university, teachers and other students. I got busy with the family business here and thus I was unable to keep in touch with them anymore.\n\nMr. Johnson is a great speaker and able to make things clearer in simple ways. He used to teach the novels and poems composed in Middles Age. He is really a man of letters and knows much about his subject. He loves his students as well and keeps close relations with them. It helps him to know more about the students and monitor their activities as well. Mr. Johnson is a smart and witty individual and owns a clear idea about the teaching methods. I also maintained a close association with him and received many suggestions from him in my needs. Sudden meet with him at a local shopping mall in Tokyo surprised me greatly. In fact, I had not thought to meet him here. I met him last in Australia while my departure. He came to bid me farewell. But now meeting him in my country created a sense of joy inside me.   \n\nI have to maintain my family business. Actually, I am the only boy in my family. So, I have to attend different activities to run the family business. We deal with different things. The most profitable business is clothing. We import different types of attires in Tokyo and sell them in local shopping malls. We also proudly own one of the best chain shops in the city. I was busy talking with some of the staffs when I met Mr. Johnson. He was shopping at the store. He saw me first and approached me and I really was glad. I was overwhelmed with joy. I met him last about five years ago when I left my Australian university. I welcomed him warmly to my country and entertained him as much as possible for me right then. I also presented with some of the items which made him happy indeed.\n\nBut I was really surprised to see him in Japan. I could not think that he would ever come to my country. He came to Japan to attend a conference and told me that he lost my address. I also informed him about my engagement with the business. I have to travel in different Asian countries for collecting necessary items and products for my shops and selling points. Moreover, I also remain busy in different other issues like resolving problems with staffs, corporate relations and communication with both the clients and suppliers and much more. As a result, I cannot manage time for myself too. So, meeting with familiar people really makes me glad but I was extremely surprised with Mr. Johnson as it was beyond my expectation."

    "Answer": "Sociologists define social change as changes in human interactions and relationships that transform cultural and social institutions. Social changes are inevitable because we human, by born, are prone to finding new ways and ideas to keep us moving “forward”. Not to mention, some of these changes have slowly crept into our society also.\n\nAnyway, one of these social changes, which I am to talk about here, is related to the ill-treatment of elderly people and their overall position in our society. I remember very well when I was growing up as a child, that people around me, regardless of their social status and ideologies, used to treat elderly people with the utmost respect by making ways for them, by leaving seats for them, as well as by communicating with them in a very mild tone. Even in my own family, I remember that my parents, uncles and aunts used to seek all kinds of advice from my elderly grandparents. In return, my grandparents also used to freely offer their opinions whether the advice-seeking persons liked them or not.\n\nBut, unfortunately, today I don’t really see this kind of nice and polite treatment of the elderly people in our society. Instead, today we see these elderly people getting treated very poorly, not only by the other people in their society but also by their very own family members. In fact, today, many people in my society can be seen sending their elderly parents or grandparents to “retirement home” or “senior citizens home” because their children don’t have any time to take care of them.\n\nOf course, this social change hasn’t happened overnight, rather it has happened slowly over the last 3 decades or so. But, whichever way this change has crept into our society, it has certainly made our society more “selfish and cruel” than ever before. Besides, it also has created some new economic reality where elderly people are seen as some “burden” for our society, as far as its financial obligation is concerned."

    "Answer": "Thank you, sir/ madam, for this wonderful topic. I live in India and this country has gone through numerous social and political changes in the last 100 years which are all so remarkable and historic. Social changes are basically social progress or the evolution of socio-culture. Positive social changes move society forward and this takes time. The most significant social change I have witnessed is the 'Gender Equity' and for this candidate task card topic, I would like to talk about it.\n\nIt took a long, it happened slowly and it had cost many innocent lives but this social change happened for good. Women in India had no voice, no participation in the key positions, no role in the decision-making, were treated mostly like slaves and had been the victim of clear discriminations by the male-dominated society. The history of the brutality to women, discrimination and helplessness of Indian women was unfathomable.  It was not more than 60 years or so when women empowerment, education and right were only dreams that no one dared to dream. A female child was considered to be a curse to a family and the life of a typical Indian woman was not better than the life of a slave; in fact, in some cases worse! Burning or Burying alive the Widows of Hindus was a black chapter in our history that was abolished in 1829 by the British authority.\n\nThis is no longer the truth- Indian women now have an equal right and have the freedom to work in any sector they like. Many powerful positions are held by women now and the evil acts and ignorant belief regarding women have almost vanished. Parents these days educate both their male and female children and this is indeed a very positive sign.\n\nI think it is really hard to say how long it took. I believe it took several centuries! However, the good thing is, it finally happened and our generation has witnessed it.\n\nHow it happened?  - I would say education, globalisation, and humanity played the most crucial roles in making it happen. Great people like Madhusree Dutta, Shruti Kapoor, Manasi Pradhan, Mamatha Raghuveer Achanta and Idrees Ul Haq  have contributed through their activity and voice to make it happen.\n\nEducation has broadened people's mind, has eradicated many superstitions and helped people become more rational and logical. Globalisation helped us compare our social conditions with that of many developed countries and have eliminated many false feeling of pride we had. Finally, humanity revived and made us more human and less animal to treat everybody equally regardless of their sex, colour and religion. There are still some discriminations but the progress has already been made.\n\nThis single sociocultural evolution has tremendous effects on people and the society in India. Both male and female are getting equal opportunities in education, job, politics and other sectors and their combined contribution have helped a lot for the advancement of the country- economically and socially. This is further accelerating the education, industrial and agricultural productions and economic progress. The social unrest, domestic violence and overall crime have dropped and that ensures a better living standard for all. Equal participation in job ensures better productivity and more reserve of the foreign remittance. Women's participation in education, law-enforcing force, army, politics, business, factory and in other sectors have established us as an emerging superpower in the world and this had all been possible due to the social progress in equal opportunity."

    "Answer": "Canada is one of the most developed countries in the world. It provides a good number of facilities to its citizens. The public health coverage is a great social change for the country. It is helping a large number of citizens to get scopes in dealing with their health issues. I would like to thank you for this nice cue card topic and the opportunity to let me talk about a remarkable social change in my country.\n \nEarlier, the citizens and people of the country had to spend from their pocket or had to rely on the employers for health care. And it had some detrimental impacts on society. They were unable to bear the health insurance or other health care facilities by them. In fact, it was a bit difficult for ordinary people to bear the expenses. But with the change of time, the government of the country has brought some changes in the health care system. With the adoption of some social policies, the issue of health care received much priority, and this has brought an important change in society.    \n\nThe change in health care did not come overnight. It began at the beginning of the 1960s. At present, this is on the top of the list and we, all the Canadians, are proud of it. In the beginning, the health care system was under private initiatives. But the government took steps to make it public and thus affordable to all. Before the launching of this program, it was a profitable issue to the related people. But after the launching of this social program, the public-funded health care brought a huge social change. Now the ordinary citizens can have the right medical and health care facilities they are in need of. Now the Canadians have comprehensive health insurance and this is automated. The expenses are met from the public health coverage plans. As a result, they do not need to pay any more for health care services.     \n\nThis is really a great social change. It took a long time to be established. Initially, it was almost impossible to formulate such a policy where people will have not to pay for their health care services they receive from the service providing organisations. After the initiation, the model was followed by the different provincial governments. Usually, the government bears almost all the necessary costs for the health care of its citizens. But sometimes the people also need to pay a minimal amount of money to support the service or they need to pay a monthly premium for the overall services they receive. But in reality, it is really an expensive issue. So, it took a notable amount of time to be established perfectly.      \n\nThis change has some positive impacts on society. Firstly, now the number of diseases and disabilities is on the decrease. People can opt for a wide variety of health and medical care facilities. They almost need not pay any cost except the monthly premium instalment for the services they have availed or any other supplementary services if they are in need of. As a direct result, the Canadian citizens are healthier and the average lifespan has also increased to a great extent. They are able to move freely without diseases and disabilities. They do not need to worry about health care in both individual and family level. The government is to provide the necessary services. In fact, this is a kind of inner satisfaction that helps to work without worries which contribute to increasing the GDP."

    "Answer": "I have had some sketchy thoughts over the years about how my ideal home should exactly look like, but never really had the opportunity to put those thoughts into words. So, thank you for this great cue card topic it will allow me to talk about my ideal home.\n\nMy ideal home would preferably be located in the countryside which is not too far from the city. It should be famous for its stunning natural beauty, and it should also have a huge lake, surrounded by some incredibly beautiful rolling hills which catch the sunlight when breaking through the clouds on a beautiful afternoon. And as far as the weather of the location of my ideal home is concerned, it should have pleasant weather all around the year.\n\nNow, talking about some of the features of my ideal home, it should be about 2000 square feet. I would also prefer to be like a two-storey, bungalow type home that has dormer windows and balconies all sides. In my ideal home, there would be a huge living room where a lot of people can sit and enjoy their time comfortable. The kitchen should also be large. On one corner of my home, there should be a room with a pool table and some musical instrument so that I can enjoy some fun time on my own without ever having to go outside. Finally, to give it a country look, I also want some faux animal heads as well as some animal prints on my walls.\n\nBy the way, this kind of accommodation attracts me so much because it will allow me to enjoy the outdoors by walking, cycling, sailing, kayaking and so on at my will.\n\nWell, this would be an ideal home, mainly because it would allow me to enjoy nature very much from the comfort of my home. It would be an ideal home also because it would allow me to stay away from the terrible noise and pollution of a busy city life."

    "Answer": "I must say that this is a very interesting topic to talk about. I really thank you for this nice cue card topic and the time you gave me to talk about it.\n\nWell, I like the house I currently live in but it is not the ideal home I have in my mind. My perfect home would be far away from the city crowd and pollutions. It would be quite large; to be more specific, not less than 2 acres. I would like it to be located near a small river where the sweet southern breeze would flow all the time and would keep the house and its gardens fresh and airy. My imagination would go further and would want to have hills on the North and West side of this area. I will often go hiking in the hills and during the summer season, I will enjoy camping. My dream house to live in would not be merely a house with bricks, but also the view and the things surrounded this house.\n\nGetting back to the house, it would be a Cottage with large rooms. The guest house would be just beside the main house. Different plants and trees would make a vista at the entrance of the house. The Spring would fill the house with a dazzling and sweet aroma of different flowers while the gardens would be a safe harbour for different birds. The ground, garden, rooms, and the whole premises would be meticulously maintained.\n\nPersonally, I would love to live with my family and I would often invite my friends and relatives to have parties at our house. The open space for the barbeque party would be reserved for family parties. I would have a large library in my house and would like to have the modern technology that I find useful for myself. Modern facilities like the internet connection, satellite  phone, TV, modern household appliance, and security system would be present at my house. My living room would be large enough and the window must have a lovely view.\n\nCurrently, I live with my family in an apartment in a large city. This city is quite crowded and has got large buildings, factories, buses, trains, busy people and offer almost no natural scene. I do not have any complaints about the apartment we live in but if you ask, this is not the ideal house I dream about. In my mind, the idea of an ideal house emerged when I visited a bungalow in Switzerland as a tourist many years ago. This was a remote area and the surrounding could  not have been better with the river, hills, fountain, hilly roads, natural beauty and moreover the tranquillity of nature. The location as well as the house we stayed it impressed me a lot. I thoroughly enjoyed staying there, even though this lasted only for a few days, and I would like to own such a house at such a gorgeous place."

    "Answer": "Living under shade is one of the basic needs of the human being. In fact, this a precondition to living on this planet that everyone should have their own home. Though I have a place to live in, I have a dream of an ideal home for me. I am lucky to describe the dream here and thank you for asking to explain the issue.\n\nFirstly, I am a nature lover. So, I want my place to be close to nature. In fact, I love to breathe in a natural environment. Fresh air revives me and provides the necessary to complete my daily tasks. But the current place I am living in is unable to provide such a calm and serene environment at all. It is filled with hustle and bustle of city life. Moreover, the entire locality is excessively crowded with people and vehicle round the day. So, there are fewer chances to spend some leisure hours peacefully.\n\nI am single and not planning to get married for the next five years. So, I do not need a large home to live in. Rather, I am in a dream of a moderate place where I could accommodate my necessary belongings. I want that the place should have at least two spacious rooms with other necessary modern facilities. I have a plan that I will make a living room and a bedroom in the place. The living room will be decorated with a large bookshelf, three of four chairs or sofas, a reading table, a television set and other things. In opposite, I will set the personal computer in my bedroom. I have a single bed and the room should be spacious enough to hold my other furniture. An approximate measure would be 10 by 12 for each of the rooms.\n\nThe place would contain all the necessary stuff I use in my everyday life. But the most important thing is that the location should be calm and quiet. I would prefer the trees around the place. Besides, I also have a plan for pot planting inside the rooms I will live in. My current place is unsuitable for pot planting as it is devoid of sunlight. Hence, I want that place to be illuminated naturally so that I could use the daylight perfectly. Further, the place should also come with security measures. It should be able to prevent intruders. It is better if the place comes with a boundary and the house will be in the centre of the boundary. I have a dream of planting trees in each corner of the boundary wall while I will insert some plants as well on the walls of the house. This is really a dream for me to materialise.\n\nI am a writer by profession. So, I need a suitable environment to expand my imagination. This is nearly impossible to create some notable tasks in a busy and noisy environment. Hence, the necessity of a serene atmosphere is required. Besides, I am attracted to such kind of accommodation for many reasons. Firstly, living in such a calm and quiet place helps to bring satisfaction of mind. It also expands the mental faculty and as a result, the imaginations become free to move. The fiction plots are found. Besides, being an introvert in nature, I love to lead an isolated life. Such a place will ensure isolation. Considering the issues, such accommodation system attracts me much."

    "Answer": "Thank you for this interesting cue card topic. I have been lucky to know some persons in my personal and professional life who I also consider 'good leaders'. Today, I would like to talk about such a good leader who has done something amazing to help the people of my little town.\n\nThis good leader, I am talking about, is a distant cousin, and also a friend, of mine. But, even though, he is a distant cousin to me by blood relation, all my family members, including me, have a very warm relation with him because of his graceful manner.\n\nBy the way, I have known him for more than 20 years from my early childhood since he always used to visit my family on all kinds of social gatherings and occasions. And, the person has always been into helping other people whether he or she is from our own town or from outside of it. And that’s probably why he couldn’t carry onto finishing his academic studies beyond junior college.\n\nBut, that doesn’t necessarily mean that he is any less smart than any highly educated and qualified person. In fact, he is one of the richest and most successful businessmen of our town, thanks to his great entrepreneurial skills and abilities. And it is because of his great entrepreneurial abilities that he once got elected as the president of the chamber of commerce of our town and also a leader of our business community.\n\nAnyway, among many things, that this good leader has done for his community, was to arrange private funds and scholarships for the talented and athletic young students of our town in order to help them become even more successful.\n\nWell, I think that this \"cousin plus friend\" of mine is a good leader, mainly because he is always ready to help other people. I consider him to be a good leader also because he is never afraid to take tough decisions even if they harm him personally in the long run."

    "Answer": "A ‘good leader’- That’s quite a philosophical concept! I can think of a friend who I think is a brilliant leader. I’m going to tell you all about her. Who she is, what she does, how I come to know her, but most importantly what it is about her approach that I think makes her a great leader.\n\nSo this is a friend of mine I was at school with. After finishing our education with both went in different directions, and I didn’t see her again for thirty years when we met up again completely by chance in a different city where we were both now living. It’s actually quite hard to describe ‘what she does’ because that is part of her style, she does lots of different things, and it seems wrong somehow to pigeon hole her with just one activity.  She makes a living through running her own business making specially decorated biscuits which she supplies by mail order. But she is the sort of person who always has a multitude of things on the go at any one time. She is involved in many sports clubs, on the organising committee for the local scouts (a national youth organisation) - including arranging an annual Guy Fawkes’ Night bonfire and firework display for many years which is their main fundraising event; and on top of that, she is always initiating new – to me ambitious – projects like holding a huge birthday party or suggesting an outing further afield.\n\nWhat makes this friend a good leader is hard to pinpoint. I don’t think it is a single thing, it is rather a combination of positive characteristics. She is very energetic, so prepared to work hard to get things done. She is optimistic, inclined to see opportunities and possibilities where other people might be put off by potential problems. This energy and optimism engage other people. You can be confident if you invest time and energy in supporting her ideas they will happen, it won’t be a waste of time. She is also incredibly well organised, with attention to detail. This is important for morale! It means that if you turn up in the pouring rain to I don’t know, build a bonfire or erect a tent, she will have thought of things that make it fun. You will find a gas bottle fuelled urn of bubbling hot water to make tea to keep you going, or maybe at a certain time, a mass order of scalding hot chips, wrapped in paper from the local chip shop will appear as if by magic to keep everyone going for a couple more hours. She has an ability to network, which means if one of her projects require some particular expertise she’ll almost inevitably know someone who knows someone that will get it done for free. It is inspiring to be involved in her projects, you get a great sense of satisfaction working together as part of a team, confident that the person driving it all forwards knows what needs to be done, and that it will be enjoyable along the way. When whatever project it is has finished, she always remembers to thank you and let you know for example how much money was raised, or how many people attended. It is quite a skill.\n\nLeadership is not easy. A good leader in my view inspires and motivates others to do their best, rather than tells people what to do. By believing in you, they can help you believe in yourself, and then everyone together achieves far more than they ever could on their own, and probably a great deal more than they thought possible at the outset…. If only my managers and bosses in the workplace had such good leadership skills I think I’d get a lot more done!"

    "Answer": "My first encounter with Edda Derica took place at the University of Hamburg. Both of us were students of political science there. Now she is a promising leader for one of the local political parties. I am happy having the chance to recall about her.\n\nEdda Derica is a lady filled with great vigour. She is from a noble German family. Derica wanted to join politics and she did so with the support of her family. At present, she is the second in command of a political party and playing important roles. She is smart and intelligent. She was the same in her university days when I had met her. I have been familiar with her such characteristics from a long ago and also inspired her to reach her goals. In her private life, Derica is not so much reserved. She loves meeting new people and makes a good inter-personal relation which is a must for a political leader.\n\nDerica is an influential leader of Free Voters, one of the leading political parties in Germany. She is the second in command for the party and undertakes a large number of responsibilities. But in her career, she is a teacher. She is a teacher of social science at a local university but she does not take full-time classes there. She is a part-time faculty because she needs to remain busy with her political activities. But she is bright in both cases. She has a great demand in her university as a teacher and at the same time, she is gaining popularity among the people and her political party authority for her contribution to the growth of the party. She is now responsible for raising awareness among the population about her party, take some important decisions, add or remove members and more other tasks.       \n\nI was a student at the University of Hamburg. Before getting admission in Political Science, I took admission in Economics as an undergraduate. But later, I moved to Political Science as I lost interest in Economics and the course also appeared complex to me. In the first day of the class, I took a seat beside a girl. I did not know that she would be the best friend of mine in the university days and will remain forever. She was Derica. The initial introduction started from her part as I was a bit shy and introvert in communication with others. Later, I found that this young girl was enriched with robustness and had a great vision in mind.   \n\nDerica is a good leader. She owns some exceptional qualities with her. She is a good leader and will move ahead, I believe, for some reasons. First of all, she knows how to deal with people. This is her inborn quality. She knows how to handle situations, how to take control of agitating people or how to keep them under control. Besides, she is able to deliver speeches smartly and thus wins the hearts of her audiences. She comes forward whenever she finds someone in distress and she does it from her heart. Derica has no expectations in return for the favour she did to others. As a result, she is moving forwards and secured her position as an influential figure in her party within a couple of years after joining. She owns the potentials to grow more. Based on such analysis, I think she has the leadership skills and someday she will reach in a top position."

    "Answer": "Well, as much as I love driving, I must say that train is, and always has been, my favourite means of transportation. In fact, I have been travelling by train since my early childhood when my father needed to take us (me and my little sister) to our grandparents because they (my grandparents) just loved us too much.\n\nBut, that’s just a long time ago when I still didn’t know much difference between travelling by bus and train. All I knew back then that I just loved the rhythmic sound (some would call it “noise”) of a moving train while whistling through the tunnels and trees. Now, add to it is the excitement of meeting grandparents and their spoiling love, there just didn’t seem to be anything better than a train journey.\n\nBut, now, of course, I am much older and as such just don’t have the same kind of excitement. Rather, I have a great sense of security when travelling by train. After all, the train is probably the only public means of transportation in my country which provides a very high standard of travel safety and security at a very reasonable price. However, the problem is that in my country, there are not enough trains for short commuting, probably because there is just too much pressure of long-distance travellers on this popular means of public transportation.\n\nSo, I can’t really use this transportation as often as I would like to.  In fact, I use the train mostly when I travel a long distance in order to meet my friends and relatives, and that too not more than once or twice in a few months.\n\nAnyway, the train is my favourite means of transportation, mainly because it offers me a great sense of comfort and safety at a rather affordable price. After all, a train is more spacious with bigger seats.  It is my favourite means of transportation also because it offers me some good freedom to do other things, like reading and chatting with my friends, in my privacy."

    "Answer": "Favourite means of transport? That’s easy! I love going off on adventures, and there is one particular form of transport that I strongly associate with starting off on a voyage of discovery. I wonder if you will feel the same way about it, or whether you might think I’m a bit odd for thinking about it in such a romantic way!  \n\nI’ll tell you what it is, when and how often I use it as well as why, and try to convey to you why it is my favourite way to travel, even if the reality isn’t always as magical as my imagination would like it to be.\n\nMy favourite means of transport is the train! I don’t really use the train all that often, but that is part of the attraction. For day to day getting about town I tend to walk, or use the local bus, or if there is no public transport where I want to go then I’ll take my car. However, if I’m heading off further afield I always like to take the train, so that might be just a few times a year, and always for a longish journey – perhaps three hours if I’m going to London, but a lot longer if I was travelling right up to Scotland for example.\n\nI use the train for lots of reasons. The practical reasons are that it is usually a comfortable way to travel as long as you go off peak. (I DO NOT enjoy being packed on a commuter train in the rush hour – that is a completely different railway experience). In cars or coaches, I can get a bit travel sick if I’m a passenger, but there is something soothing about the trundle of a train. I never feel ill journeying that way. Trains are also reasonably efficient at getting you from city to city towards your final destination, and you don’t have to worry about getting stuck in traffic, so although it can be an expensive way to get about, it is always reassuring that you will probably get to wherever you are going on time to say catch your flight or make your meeting appointment.\n\nThose are the practical reasons, but there are more emotional reasons why I like train travel. It is the anticipation you get sitting on a train, heading for a maybe new city, or to get a plane to an unknown destination and you start to think about all the exciting possibilities ahead. It is the first step into the unknown of travel, and it makes you feel alive!  Then, there is the joy of seeing new scenery unfolds as the train passes through towns, cities, countryside. Even if the route is familiar, it will always look different on any day depending on the time of year, the weather, the time of day. You get little snapshots of other people’s lives as you can see into their back gardens, watch them walking through the countryside, or even (if I’m honest) peering into their houses. The view from the train window may not always be beautiful, but it will always be interesting.  Depending on my mood, I like to look at the other passengers and imagine what their stories and destinations might be.  Some travelling alone like me, maybe carrying suitcases or backpacks and will be going off on holiday somewhere. There might be others wearing suits and clutching briefcases trying to get to important work meetings. Screeching groups of friends could be on their way to a reunion or party, and then there are quieter couples of individuals who might be going to the shops, visiting a friend or family member in a hospital. I like it when you see gangs who are clearly on their way to the same destination such as a day at the races (all wearing enormous hats and ‘posh’ clothes that would normally be out of place in the middle of the day). Sometimes it might be fans going to a concert or people from one particular profession heading to a work conference. I try and guess where they are all heading.\n\nAmongst this throng of fellow travellers, you sometimes strike gold. British people have a reputation for not talking on trains, and generally, this is true. You do have to be a bit careful about how you read other people’s body language before you strike up a conversation. However, sometimes something will happen – the train is delayed, or you have to talk to each other as you are finding your reserved seat, and then to coin a phrase you’ve ‘broken the ice’ and talk flows.  I’ve had some of the best conversations and experiences of my life talking to strangers on a train. I have a theory that if you are talking to people you will probably never see again, you can be honest and direct in a way you would never risk in ‘normal’ chit chat. I can recall a few. One day I was on a train that was delayed for several hours due to an accident on the track ahead. Probably a suicide I think, although the announcements were a bit vague. This delay led to me having a really profound talk with the woman alongside me. We discussed quite literally attitudes to life and death, personal experiences of dealing with family illnesses, and notions of identity. We also had much more light-hearted conversation about fashion malfunctions and embarrassing stories about ourselves! We talked for hours, but at the end of our journey said our goodbyes and I don’t even know her name. I’ve had other amazing conversations too, one with a guy who claimed to provide personal banking services to millionaires – I’m sure it wasn’t true, but it was fascinating hearing him tell his tales ‘in confidence’ trying to impress me. On another occasion, I met an elderly woman who said she’d been a spy in the war – doubtful, but great to hear her stories all the same. Then there was the youngish man who chose me to unburden his soul to about his relationship problems with his girlfriend. I was surprised by the intimacy of his disclosures, but nosy enough to listen to it all anyway!\n\nSo trains are great.  They not only take you to glorious destinations, they are in themselves a snapshot of the world. If you are cautiously open enough to engage with others around you, you can gain insights into other worlds and experiences. You might even get some good advice along the way!\n\nSadly, not all train experiences are like this. Some are crowded, exasperating, squashed up against the armpits of others, getting increasingly annoyed at the fumes from the overflowing loo and being angry at the noisiness of drunken youths a few seats down. On those journeys, I try to close my eyes, concentrate on the rhythmic rocking of the train and imagine myself back on one of my more life-affirming journeys. Maybe next time I get on a train it will be like that all over again!"

    "Answer": "Transportation is a great issue to consider here in Jakarta, Indonesia. It is really hard to move with public transports and meeting deadlines for reaching office. So, I have my own transport. I will describe the topic here and would like to thank you for this nice topic.\n \nI work for a multinational company headquartered in Indonesia. In fact, I am the country manager for the company here and have been assigned to deal with lots of issues together. Earlier, before having the car, I used to ride on public transports. But it was difficult for me to reach the office in due time and complete my responsibilities. Even though I got out of the home about one and a half-hour before the office hour began, I was unable to reach by 9.00 am. The sluggish movement of the transports and congestion on the roads caused the delay. So, I bought a Fiat 500L. Now it is no more a problem for me to reach office. Further, I can use the car after my will and the movement inside the city has become easier for me now.\n\nI use the car frequently. Actually, I rely on it for my movements inside and outside of Jakarta. Often I have to move for visiting markets and production plants. And at the same time, I have to meet some strict deadlines. I use the car almost every day in the week. Mostly I use it for visiting my office. The car is kept in the office garage during my office hours. Generally, I move from my home to the office in the morning. I start my journey at 8.10 am and reach the office by around 8.50 am. It takes almost half of the times than public transport.\n\nI use the car for different purposes. When I did not have the car, I was unable to do everything so exactly as I am doing now. I failed to attend meetings in time, missed the deadlines of reaching in production plants and so on. Moreover, I had to wait for a bus or taxi which was also difficult. But waiting did not ensure that I would be able to ride on the bus while the taxi drivers demanded three times more than the usual fare. Riding on a crowded public bus was really a trouble for me. But now, they have vanished. I also use the car for moving to any parts of the city with my family. It is really a great advantage for me. It appears that I have got freedom.  \n\nThe car is my favourite transport for many reasons. First of all, while riding a car, you do not need to think overreaching the destination in time unless there are no accidents of huge traffic congestions on the roads. The public transports make the delay as it carries a large number of passengers and they need to ride or get off to different destinations. Besides, the transports wait for the passengers in the stoppages which also play an important role to kill time. As a result, a huge number of working hours are wasted. But with the car I own, there are no such issues. I can start and stop the journey at any time or at any place I need. Moreover, I drive the car and use apps to avoid traffic congestions on my way to the destination. For all such reasons, the car is my favourite mode of transport."

    "Answer": "Event or not, \"waiting\" probably is among the least favourite thing to many people. But, still, we have to wait because most of the times, it is because of \"our wait\" that we get the expected result.\n\nThe event, for which I needed to wait for a considerable period of time, took place about almost 6 years ago when I still was a university student. This event was popularly known as an annual cultural program at our university in which any student could take part and perform.\n\nOf course, I never really actively participated in such cultural programme because, frankly speaking, I had just no cultural talent except reading poems. But, unfortunately, reciting poems was never a part of the annual cultural programme of our university and therefore, I never really got a chance to prove my “cultural talent”.\n\nBut, anyway, the cultural programme, I am talking about, was a special one because my roommate, and also a very good friend at the same time, was about to play his magical guitar playing skills. So, naturally, I was very excited while seating and waiting on the front row seat of our university auditorium except, of course, there was no sign of starting the programme. I tried to find out the reason of the delay, and I was told that the pro-vice-chancellor, and also the chief guest of the cultural show on that night, couldn’t arrive on time due to some unavoidable circumstances. However, the chief guest did finally arrive, and the programme also had started, but it wasn’t until almost two hours of \"important period\" was wasted.\n\nWell, to tell the truth, I was a bit disappointed to wait since I was very excited and pumped up to enjoy a very lively cultural programme. Besides, I also felt that the organizer of the annual cultural programme at our university had let us down because it had somewhat tarnished the reputation of our university to the outsiders."

    "Answer": "I really hate waiting for things. Once I’ve decided on a course of action that I want to do, I like to do it immediately. I am impatient. Sometimes, though, things are completely outside of your control, and like it or not, the waiting goes on and on as if forever!\n\nI can think of one example of waiting that seemed to last an eternity. I’m going to tell you what it was, how long I had to wait and why – I think you can probably guess already how I felt about it, but I’ll explain that as well anyway.\n\nThe situation was I was in a job where I really wanted to obtain an extra qualification in recognition of the work I was doing. The award was a Fellowship from the Higher Education Academy, and it is a very useful qualification for teaching in Higher Education in the UK. This was an award you could gain by submitting evidence of your capabilities through testimonials from others, examples of reflections on your work, and proof of attending various professional development courses. However, there was a problem. No-one else in my job role had ever done this qualification before, and although I thought it would be appropriate and possible, I had no way of knowing if the panel who would assess my portfolio would feel the same way. I was a bit sneaky, because I didn’t think my manager would support me in making the application, so I decided to do it all in my own time, and in my own way. The way it worked, was once you had submitted your portfolio of evidence, a panel of senior academic colleagues would meet to discuss it, and then they would agree whether or not you adequately met the required standard. The panel, though, met very infrequently. Only every two months, and not at all during the summer. A key part of the application was a reference from a senior colleague in support of my request for recognition.  I worked really hard to gather the evidence, I read widely to provide lots of references in support of my submission. I got testimonials from others, and advice from friends working at different institutions who had already obtained the qualification. Finally, though, I had done everything I could, I just needed a referee, and I didn’t want to use my manager. It was a problem.  \n\nEventually, I plucked up the courage to ask a very senior colleague who I greatly respected. I was delighted that he enthusiastically agreed to provide the necessary reference in support of my submission. However, he was very busy, and although he promised to do it, he wasn’t able to provide it in time for me to get my application in for the last panel before the summer. This meant I had to wait three months after completing my portfolio before the panel met to agree with my fate. I knew I’d worked as hard as I could, but I also knew I was an unusual case, so I had no idea at all what the panel would decide. It was a very long summer. I had to wait nearly three months for when the next panel met before I knew my fate! I was nervous, and anxious too. Some days I felt really confident that of course, I would pass, I’d worked so hard and researched so thoroughly.  On other days I wished I hadn’t ever embarked on the process. How could I possibly gain the qualification when no-one else in my job role had done so before -mind you, no-one had tried before either, so there was always that glimmer of hope to keep me going.\n\nThen, one day in the autumn, a rather dull looking email pinged into my inbox at work. Congratulations, you have been awarded the FHEA! That was it, I’d done it! I couldn’t believe it. After months of waiting, and anxious anticipation, that was that! I hadn’t even known the panel would be meeting so it was a real surprise. I was so delighted that my hard work had paid off. Once I got the award, I explained to my manager, and he was understanding about it. Part of my reticence was that I thought if I’d tried and failed it would have been embarrassing. Of course, now I passed, everything was well with the world!\n\nSo the waiting was horrible, but it was worth it in the end. I was glad I’d taken the risk and held out to the end, but I hope I’m never again kept in suspense for an exam result for quite so long in the future!"

    "Answer": "I planned for a trip to Greece from New York to celebrate the last Christmas with my family but it was not a pleasant tour for me for different reasons. However, as it was just before Christmas eve and I was so eager to meet my parents and siblings, I enjoyed my stay there a lot. However, during the tour, I had to wait for a very long and it was a frustrating experience for me. The bad tour began with a delayed flight. I had to wait for over three hours at the airport. The delay happened for the bad weather. I am happy to have the opportunity to describe the event.\n\nIn fact, the trip was a very bad one as everything happened in the wrong manner. I failed to manage a ticket to Greece in the beginning. Besides, there was a rush in the streets and many other issues marking the Christmas. So, I was late to reach the airport on the scheduled day. Unfortunately, the flight was delayed. So, I had to wait for the flight inside at the John F. Kennedy International Airport building. Further, everything appeared disorganised to me. People were scattered and gossiping here and there while I was sitting lonely at a corner and was expecting to have the tour end.\n\nI had to wait for over three hours. The flight bound to Greece arrived at 9.45 pm while it was supposed to arrive at 5.30 pm. Besides, I made late to reach the airport. Hence, I thought that I might miss the flight and mentally got prepared for the situation. But I felt irritated after a certain period of time. I was worried about the issue of whether I would be able to move to Greece to celebrate Christmas with my parents and family. So, it appeared to me that nothing worked fine. The soft drink vending machine stopped working suddenly after I inserted a coin - a bad sign! People were chatting loudly that caused a headache for me. Besides, I had to stand during the time I waited. I could not manage a seat inside the waiting lounge. It was filled with the crowd. In fact, the delay was not only with me, but some other airliners also experienced the situation at that time.       \n\nI am a student here in New York while my family lives in Greece. So, usually, I do not miss the chances to visit my family. Accordingly, I planned a week before Christmas to celebrate the event in Greece. I informed my parents as well about my arrival. I booked a ticket from American Airlines. It is really hard to manage tickets during this season. It happens as everyone rush to make some trips in the holidays and they are not alone. They plan to visit with groups. They book tickets in advance, and thus it is really difficult for an ordinary passenger like me to manage a ticket. Luckily, I managed one after lots of troubles and requests to the booking agents. But finally, I had to wait for long hours at the airport building only for the bad weather.\n\nThe feelings were really irritating. I do not love waiting for something. I think nobody loves to wait. But we all have to wait whether we want or not. Time appears to be slower at that moment. So, it is really boring to pass the hours. Considering all the aspects, I cannot say that this was a great trip for me. But the later phase was smooth after I landed in Athens. My family members and parents arrived to take me home as I am their only son in the family. In opposite, the experience at JFK Airport was really horrible."

Some of these celebrities are sportspersons while others are from different kinds of cultural circles. Today, I would like to talk about a sports celebrity who is not only admired by me and my fellow countrymen but also by many others around the world.\n\nThe name of this famous celebrity, who I really admire, is world-famous cricketer, and his name is \"Sakib Al Hasan\". Those who have been watching cricket for the last one and half decade, they know how famous and accomplishing of a cricketer he really is because of his all-round cricketing skills and abilities. In fact, he has held the top ranking spots in all versions of cricket (Test, One Day International and T-20 cricket) for almost a decade, a feat which is only matched a few other great cricketers of this world. And because of these reasons, he is not only one of the most respected and sought-after cricketers in his own country but also in other cricketing nations play franchised cricket league.\n\nBy the way, this franchised cricket league is a comparatively newer version of cricket where different private cricket clubs from around the world hire famous cricketers from all over the world in order to organize the cricket tournaments every year. Of course, while these reasons are more than enough to admire Sakib Al Hasan, I admire him mainly because he single-handedly has taken the Bangladesh cricket to a new height from where our team can even dream of winning a world cup sooner rather than later\n\nAnyway, Sakib Al Hasan is famous because he has helped to introduce Bangladesh cricket in a new light. He is famous all around the world also because, among a number of other reasons, he is the only cricketers in the world to have scored 1000 runs and to take 30 wickets in a world cup. Finally, he is famous also because he is one of the greatest all-rounder cricketers of all time."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this candidate task card. Honestly speaking, it was a bit tough for me to pick a celebrity to talk about  as there are many of them to choose from. Finally, I decided to talk about David Beckham, who is not only a celebrity in the UK but also in the whole world. Interestingly, he comes from the same city I live in, which is London.\n\nDavid Beckham was born in Leytonstone, London in 1975. He now lived in London with his wife, Victoria Beckham, who is also a superstar, and with his four children. He is most widely known as a  great English footballer but he is also a model, spokesperson and a businessman. He played football for the England National team from 1996 to 2009 and also for the famous football clubs like the Manchester United and Real Madrid. As a professional football player, he became an icon around the world and probably one of the most esteemed celebrity alive. He is a legendary footballer who had a unique style in his bending free-kicks as a right-winger. In 2004, David Beckham was listed in FIFA's 100 greatest living player in the world. He was twice the runner-up for 'FIFA World Player of the Year'. These statistics are only a few to signify how famous he really is. He was one of the highest earners as a footballer in his time and in 2013, he was the highest-paid player in the world.\n\nAs a fan of the UK football team, I have  always liked David Beckham. He is quite an extraordinary player and a fashion figure. In my early college days, he was the footballer I wanted to be! Besides, he is a fashion icon and the young generation loves his unique style very much.\n\nMy respect for him increased, even more, when he announced the \"7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund\" to help protect children around the world. He has been a UNICEF ambassador and his recent philanthropic works are quite exceptional and for that, I admire him greatly.\n\nHe is a great person, legendary footballer, a successful husband, a doting father, a fashion icon and finally one of the most revered celebrities not only in the UK but also in the whole world. I guess anyone knows  him would admire him."

    "Answer": "I love to collect celebrity autographs and this is a hobby for me. I have visited different parts of the world and have gathered autographs of the celebrities I have met. Now, I will discuss the celebrity from my country, Australia, I admire the most.\n\nNicole Mary Kidman, better known as Nicole Kidman is an Australian celebrity. She is also a movie producer and been working with this arena since the 1980s. She got the breakthrough in a 1989 movie but she got global fame for her role in the movie – Days of Thunder. It was made and released in 1990. After the movie, she started moving ahead and had not to look back. Her struggles to become a celebrity was over and she became so. She has been awarded numerous prestigious awards and positive criticisms for her outstanding performance in the movies. Most of the cases, she won the awards for the Best Actress or the Best Leading Role.\n\nNicole Kidman is a movie star and filmmaker. She has participated in a wide number of movies and also worked behind the screen as well. She started her career in 1983 and gained world fame in 1995. She had to struggle in this time to create a platform for her own. She has performed in almost all types of movie genres but she is a better match for romantic and drama movies than the thriller, I think, as I found her performance in those genres far better attractive than her other movie genres. She is also playing some other social roles as well. Now she is involved with the UNICEF as a Goodwill Ambassador. Since her reputation soared, once she turned into the highest-paid actress in the country. Besides, she also owns dual citizenship status, one for Australia while the other one is in the USA. And it happens as she was born from the Australian parents in Hawaii.    \n\nAfter the initiation of her career, her road to success was not smooth. She had to be patient and continue her performance. With the gradual development, she became the leading actress in the country. Besides, she also has a passion for songs and she sings solo. However, some of her movies were under the scanner and some gave birth to controversy. She kissed a 10-year old boy on the movie Birth which was made in 2004. Later she resolved the issue and described that it was done to represent love, not for other purposes. She achieved Golden Globe Awards, Grammy Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards, nominations for Academy Awards among others. Further, she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was on the top of her success till 2009 and after that year she became more attentive on her career than before. She is now passing hefty moments with some drama movies and biopics.\n\nThere a good number of reasons to admire this celebrity. In fact, she is not a celebrity to me, she is a very amiable lady with her kindness and love to her audiences. She rose to the peak of success but she never forgets her audiences. I had a chance to meet her in person at a social occasion. I have taken a couple of pictures with her and also collected her autograph. In the meeting, I observed that she is really a wonderful lady in all terms. She is able to make people feel comfortable in her company. Besides, she never hesitates to meet requests from her admirers which is not present among the other celebrities. She is a lovely celebrity leading a decent life. For all such reasons, I admire her the most."

But, as far as I am concerned, I enjoyed my life the most when I was a young university student.\n\nNow, when I say that I enjoyed my life the most when I was a university student, I didn’t necessarily mean that life was not any more challenging or boring than when I was younger. In fact, as a university student, my life was probably more challenging, but at the same time, it was more exciting as well.\n\nOf course, before enrolling at my university as an undergraduate student, I was told a lot of things about university life, but I wasn’t too sure that I was able to follow it all because I very much was a small-town boy who seldom got the chance to get out of his little town. But, luckily, when I entered university, I became way more confident and optimistic about my life. And it was because of that extra confidence and optimism, I became more interested in learning new things about life and culture which I had missed up and till my junior college years.\n\nBesides, suddenly, after becoming a university student, I felt like I actually became more responsible with my newly-found freedom. Anyway, during my university years, I did and also enjoyed a number of memorable things which included leading a team of students for an educational visit, organizing an annual picnic and winning an intra-university table tennis tournament.\n\nWell, this was my most enjoyable stage of life, primarily because it allowed me to deal with the challenges and prospects of my life rather independently. I consider it to be the most enjoyable part of my life also because I learned many new and interesting things while also meeting some great people and friends along the way, who taught me how to have a successful and productive life."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this nice cue  card topic. The best part of my life is undoubtedly the childhood I have had. In fact, childhood is favourite to everyone and my childhood was extraordinary, magical and full of excitements.\n\nI spent my childhood in a suburban area which is (...say the name of the place where you spent your childhood...). This was a very beautiful place and I was lucky that I was born in this wonderful town. My parents always loved me and they had been my best companion in my childhood. Once a year, they took me out of the country to enjoy our summer holidays. I was the centre of their universe and my childhood became so gorgeous due to them.\n\nMy first visit to Greece with my parents was quite exciting and enthralling. This was the first time when I realised that people in other countries do not speak our language, they have a different eating habit and they dress differently! Apart from that, my first day at school, first ride on a bicycle, first train journey and my first pet- a dog actually- are all so vivid in my memory. I specifically remember the times I played different games and sports with my classmates and those days were heavenly. Finally, I loved reading books and my visit to our community library, that had a great collection of books, is also a memorable experience from my childhood.\n\nWhy my childhood is the most enjoyable stage in my life? - Well, I guess this was the time my inquisitive mind enjoyed everything new I saw or heard about. Reading, going to the school, playing, going out with my parents, learning new things, travelling and so man activities I had in my childhood make it extraordinary. There was no tension, responsibility and I had been surrounded by my parents love. I could ask for anything and my parents were ready to fulfil my wishes. I was in a dream world where no pain or sorrow was usually allowed to enter. My parents were my protector and I was their prince! The family bonding was strong, people cared more about others, they had more time to socialise and life was not that much mechanical that we see these days. The love, surprises, innocence, inquisitive minds, unquenchable thrusts to learning, beautiful surroundings, and worry less life made my childhood even more enjoyable. It was magical and full of wonder."

    "Answer": "University life is the most enjoyable time. In fact, everyone wishes to go back in those days. This is the part that anyone makes a lot of mistakes and then enjoys the mistakes in later phage of life. I am really glad to discuss the issue here.\n\nStudent life is the most important part of one’s life. But not all the phases are interesting as it is during the university stage. This is the time when a student may do whatever s/ he wants to do. Besides, there are none to impose any restriction. Actually, almost all the university students are adults and they have the liberty to do and participate in all the legal and logical things and facts. So, they can enjoy everything. Further, being adults, they can enjoy the tastes of life which are not possible in other parts of student life. Hence, I enjoyed this part of my life to the fullest extent.\n\nI was an undergraduate student of the University of Queensland in Australia. Admission to the university was really a hard issue for me. I had to take numerous preparations and also appeared in different tests to get the chance for admission here. Being a reputed university, I had to follow some of the rules and regulations. But I enjoyed them as well as I basked in the liberty that I never had before. I got admitted in the Humanities and Social Science department. Hence, there were fewer chances for bunking classes or exams. But I did lots of fun with my classmates and friends. Moreover, the university campus was adorable and the classrooms were well decorated. So, whenever, I went to the university for attending classes or any other purposes, I felt a sense of joy inside.\n\nMemories never die. I have a huge number of memories at the university. First of all, I used to do fun in the class. So, all the teachers loved me for my fun-loving nature. Sometimes, I made questions that I know is impossible to answer. They actually were meant to puzzle the teacher and make some fun with everyone. Accordingly, I asked them to the teachers while they were unable to answer the questions in the right manner. However, I cannot remember all the events exactly as long days have been passed after I left the university. But I can remember the event clearly when a teacher of mine cited me as an example of a smart boy. He pointed the class that this is the boy who is wicked enough to cause irritation but on the other hand he is smart and never misses his studies. I was overwhelmed by this recognition.\n\nThis is really an enjoyable part of life and I am explaining here. When people enter their profession, they cannot manage time enough time to enjoy themselves. Socializing becomes a rare issue. Besides, life turns mechanized. In fact, people cannot do even if they want to do as they lack times for other activities. They may have some routine activities but those are not enough to develop a healthy mental faculty. But during the university stage, there are no such restrictions. A student can do any legal thing after his/ her will. They can undertake trips to different places, read extracurricular books, enjoy music, participate in sports, meet their hobbies and any other things. The chances get narrower in a later phase. And before the university stage, they are disallowed from many interesting things with different excuses. Considering all the aspects, I believe this is the most enjoyable part of my life."

    "Answer": "I have been lucky to come in tough with quite a few good teachers as a student. They all have helped me tremendously in one way or another in order to help me become the person I am today. Mr. Stephen Lee is one such good teacher.\n\nI have known Mr. Stephen for almost 2 years who teaches Mathematics to the students of Junior high school. I met him for the first time when I took my 12 years old nephew to his high school as I wanted him to be a student there. Incidentally, the admission officer wasn’t present there at that moment, and it was Mr. Stephen who helped us take our seats and make us feel comfortable.  \n\nI asked Mr. Stephen who he really was, and he introduced himself to me as Mr. Stephen as well as a Senior Mathematics teacher, who also used to teach Science. By the way, my nephew wasn’t really very good student in Math, so I jokingly told him that I had come to the right person because my nephew surely could use a good math teacher. In response, Mr. Stephen told me that he was also very much up for the challenge.\n\nAnyway, after our little but very meaning conversation, the admission officer had arrived and helped my nephew get his admission there. After a month or so, I noticed that my nephew was talking very highly of Mr. Stephen as far as his teaching skills and abilities were concerned. In fact, my nephew told me very confidently that he was going to get a much better score not only in math but also in other science subjects. Needless to say, my nephew proved it in his very next semester results.  \n\nWell, I think that Mr. Stephen is a great teacher, mainly because he was very well qualified in the subjects he was teaching. I believe that he is a good teacher also because he understands the individual needs of every student so that he can take proper care of them."

    "Answer": "I can think of a great teacher. Her name is Dawn, I know her because I go to her weekly community fitness class, and I’m going to tell you just exactly why I think she is not just a good teacher, but a really great one!\n\nDawn is essentially a fitness instructor. There are lots of fitness instructors in the world, but she is unusual in her approach and enthusiasm. She works in the community, so I know her because once a week I attend a class she runs in a cold community hall in a relatively deprived part of the city where I live. Her post is funded as some sort of a health initiative, so the class is subsidised, that means it only costs me £1 (one pound) to attend, which is very cheap. Most exercise classes near me are between six to fifteen pounds an hour, depending on what you do.\n\nI’m not a natural at exercise, I know it’s good for me to keep me healthy, but I’ve never before looked forward to going to an exercise class. Dawn’s sessions are different. On one level, it is a very ordinary session. There are a few movements to music based on dance steps; some stretching; and then typically, a bit of floor work on mats that’s a little like yoga and supposedly helps you to develop your abdominal muscles (core). The one-hour session concludes with some stretching to cool down. The music plays on a tinny old cassette tape machine with terrible sound quality. The hall is light but freezing cold, and the venue a bit tucked away. It oughtn’t to be as much fun as it is.  \n\nThis fitness instructor is in my view a wonderful teacher because she is funny, enthusiastic, motivational and knowledgeable. It is a very rare combination indeed. The class is very diverse, with a wide age range from probably women in their mid-twenties perhaps on maternity leave, through to self-employed people in their middle age, right through to pensioners who are quite definitely in their late seventies and possibly in their eighties. They may be game and feisty, but they aren’t in their first flush of youth! Despite the broad age range, backgrounds and ability, Dawn includes everyone. She is a gifted facilitator to cater for such a broad range of people within one group session. She knows us all by name, she watches our technique to make sure everyone is safe and getting the most out of the session, but she is positive and encouraging. The class is full of laughter and support. She tells funny stories to distract us, and keeps the exercises moving quickly from one to another so there is never any chance to get bored.\n\nShe is also ridiculously encouraging. The way she praises us for our efforts you would imagine we could all be professional dances or gymnasts if we wanted to, our talent is limitless! As a teacher, she creates an environment where we are all confident to try new things, and test our fitness. If we make mistakes, she just laughs, and breaks down the sequence into smaller sections, until everyone is confident with what we are supposed to be doing. She gently advises on technique so that over the short period of time I’ve been attending her classes I feel my knowledge of fitness theory has developed alongside my actual stamina. I wish she did a class every day – there would be no stopping me then!\n\nA good teacher is a rare thing indeed. Knowing your subject may be a necessary pre-requisite for teaching but it is not enough in itself. Having a teacher who can engage, inspire and motivate is what really matters. All of us in the class want to do our best for Dawn, and in doing so, we achieve the best for ourselves as well."

    "Answer": "Mariana Rosaline was a teacher in our college and she used to teach us geography. She is, in my opinion, a very good teacher and I still miss her classes and guidance. I am fortunate enough to get a chance to talk about her and would like to thank you for this great cue card topic.\n \nShe was one of the adoring ladies in my college in Bilbao, Spain. In fact, I was one of her wicked students and I bunked lots of classes and later apologised for the mistakes. In fact, I had a gang who used to do such naughty activities. However, she was the lady who occasionally complained about the issues but really cared about her students and advised to be obedient and attentive to the class. She has a beautiful outlook with her curly hairs and large dark eyes. But her impressive look was the concerning issue for us as her personality was quite rigid. Whenever she looked at us, we felt uncomfortable as it gave the impression that she was reading our mind.\n \nI have met with Mariana Rosaline first in my college. In fact, I was unable to realize that she could be a teacher. I thought she was a newly enrolled student like me as she looked too young to be a teacher. Later, I came to know that she was the most talented teachers of the college and loved her students very much. In opposites, she also received many appreciations from her students for her exemplary style of teaching. She was the most adorable teacher to me and I liked her very much as a mentor and a good teacher. She guided almost all of her students with a motherly affection while some of the students tried to misuse her simplicity. They, in fact, misjudged her personality and never thought she could be quite formidable if important rules are violated. She was the only lecturer in the college who avoided any types of punitive measures rather she had regular meets with the guardians. Despite this, we never took her lightly as her personality bound us to respect her and abide by her rules. She invited the guardians and informed about the latest updates of the students. It was a tricky way indeed to generate attention in academic activities.   \n\nShe was a Geography teacher for the eleventh graders. She had a higher degree on the subject and thus felt quite comfortable in teaching the subject. I was amazed at her skills in making us listen to her lectures. She rarely used books in her class. Instead of books, she used some PowerPoint presentation to make the details clearer. Actually, her method of teaching was really great. On the other hand, she was also responsible to maintain the overall activities of our class. She was assigned as our class teacher for a semester. I found that her organizing ability was better than any other teacher in the college. Often she used to discuss the geographical and environmental issues and tried to teach us lessons which are out of the syllabus but quite important and interesting for us. When she discussed the environmental science, she told us about many interesting facts and shared valuable information which appeared helpful during the exams even after we left college.\n\nShe is really a good teacher and possesses all the qualities to guide a student in the right manner. Though she lived in the same area of mine here in Bilbao, which was about two hours' journey to the class, she was never late for the classes unlike me. Basically, the distance of the college was a bit far from the locality I lived in and I was a latecomer in the class while she was the opposite. As a teacher, she never missed her classes, rather, she went to college even before anyone reached there. She never rebuked us but made us feel guilty with her soft and wise words. As a result, we used to impress her with better grades. I think this is the thing that a teacher wants from students."

    "Answer": "I am certainly not the most punctual person in this world, and so, I can’t really say for sure that I don’t waste my time doing unnecessary things. So, today, I would like to talk about doing something which I later realized was a total waste of time.\n\nIt happened about a few months ago when I went to do some fishing. Now, fishing is one of my most favourite, if not the most favourite, hobbies, and therefore, whenever I get an opportunity to do fishing, I like to grab it with my two hands even if it means that I have to travel 100 miles for it.\n\nSo, when I heard that there was a small natural lake, that had plenty of fishes in it, about 40 kilometres away from where I live, I didn’t see any reason for not going there. So, on one fine morning during my weekend, I just grabbed my fishing rods and other fishing materials and headed towards the lake in my nice little car.\n\nBut, a huge disappointment was in waiting for me as I reached the lake and started my favourite act to catch all the big fishes. In fact, I waited for almost 2 hours there, trying all sorts of tricks and things with my fishing rods and baits, but it looked like the fishes in that lake were determined not to eat my baits. At some point, after trying for more than two long hours, was that I managed to catch just one small catfish. What a terrible waste of time!\n\nAnyway, a terrible waste of time indeed it was because I drove for almost 45 minutes to reach that lake and spent more than 2 hours, playing with my fishing rods, for almost nothing! After all, I could have used that time to do something else, like doing some physical exercises or visiting some friends who I hadn’t met in a long time, instead of going fishing."

    "Answer": "Oh no!  I’m embarrassed about talking about this topic because I’m so good at time-wasting. I’ve almost turned it into an art form, and that’s terrible, isn’t it. I do my best time-wasting when I’ve got something important to do, but which I keep putting off, so I’ll procrastinate by doing lots of things that aren’t really essential, but distract me from what I should be doing. I tell myself I’ll work better on that essay if I just tidy my desk/ have something to eat/ make that phone call first! Does that sound familiar to you? Still, even the sorts of things you do when procrastinating might be useful, that desk could have needed tidying and that phone call did need to be made. The worst sort of time-wasting has no side off benefit at all. OK, so I can think of a great example of this! I’ll tell you the what, when and why – I think it will be obvious without explanation that it was indeed, a complete waste of time!\n\nSo I was lucky enough to be travelling, and I’d stopped off at a Youth Hostel in Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. It was humid and hot and I was exhausted. Even so, here I was in an amazing location, and I just didn’t have the energy to go outside. It was off-season, and also, for various reasons Zimbabwe has lost some of its appeals to tourists in recent years, so it was very quiet. Lots of the guesthouses and attractions were run down and shut, and the place felt a bit on edge. I was alone at the guest house, and decided I’d just relax by watching TV for a bit. Now, there wasn’t much in the way of English language stations, so I ended up stumbling on a Kung Fu film with English subtitles. It was an old film, and really badly made, what’s more, is I don’t even like Kung Fu films!  Even so, I sat through it for about 2 hours, then just at the critical point where the film plot was coming to its somewhat laboured conclusion, the screen went blank, and then the film restarted right at the beginning! I couldn’t believe it. I’d just sat there for over 2 hours, watching a terrible movie, and I didn’t even get to see the end!\n\nSo the ‘what’ was watching not quite all of a terrible made-for-TV martial arts film; the ‘when’ was whilst I should have been exploring an amazing new location on arriving at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe; as for the ‘why’? Well, I don’t know really what possessed me! I was tired, and I thought it would be good to relax a bit, but I so regretted it.\n\nI felt so cross with myself afterwards. Life is short, I would probably never be in this part of the world again, I should have gone out exploring and caught up on relaxation and sleep later. It had been cripplingly hot it’s true, but it had also been bright sunshine through the humidity. I should have gone to see the infamous waterfalls that afternoon, the light would have been perfect for creating rainbows. As it was, I went the next morning when it was cooler, but very overcast, not a rainbow in sight. I am still furious with myself for missing that wonder of the world for a bad film.\n\nSo do I need to spell out anymore why it was a complete waste of time? I missed the chance to see a spectacular set of waterfalls in what would have been the perfect light for generating the multitude of rainbows for which that stretch of water is particularly famous. Not only did I miss out on this because I was watching a terrible film, but it was also a terrible film which I didn’t even get to see the end of! Lesson learned. Sometimes however tired you feel, or lacking in energy, if an opportunity comes your way seize it, it might not come round again, and time wasted, isn’t time you will ever get back!"

    "Answer": "Last year I bought a book on wood-crafting as I thought I would learn and make some fabulous designs from simple wood. The idea came from a documentary I watched on TV and I thought buying a book and then trying it at home would be a good way to learn this skill. But to my dismay, that turned out to be a very difficult task for me and I lost my interest in a few days. The whole thing was a waste of time in my opinion.\n\nI thought reading this book would actually help me learn how to make simple designs from wood and it must be easy to follow. But to my surprise, the book focused too much on the history of wood-crafting rather than presenting how to create one. I must have picked up the wrong book!\n\nThen I watched some videos online and tried to mimic them. It would be probably early March last year when I tried this. I had an exam in July and yet I spent more than 3 weeks trying to learn this skill. I did it out of curiosity than passion and that might have been the main reason I lost my interest quite soon.\n\nI spent many days and more than 400 dollars to arrange everything I required to successfully create beautiful woodcraft. However, I picked the off-topic book and had not tried very hard. The whole process taught me nothing and cost me a good amount of money. This is why I consider it a complete waste of time, especially, since I did it before an important exam I had. That was very disappointing for me."

    "Answer": "Football matches are always interesting to me, and I never miss any high voltage matches. And I love watching the matches in stadiums. But last month, I had a different experience. I could not enjoy the football match between FC Barcelona and Inter Milan due to heavy rainfall.\n\nI went to watch a football match between the two teams. Though the match was set to be televised, I preferred to enjoy it at the nearby stadium, Camp Nou, in my city Barcelona. I wanted to enjoy the match as I am a diehard fan of FC Barcelona. Besides, the stadium is only a 10-minute walk from my residence. Considering everything, I decided to move to the stadium. But a sudden shower changed everything, the field got wet. And it was impossible to play on that wet field. Hence, it was a waste of time for me. Neither I could enjoy the match, nor I could complete my official tasks.\n\nThe match was set to be held on the evening of December last year, and I cannot remember the date exactly. In the day, I was at my office and booked a ticket for the match. The evening was a bit cold while the weather was a bit cloudy. But it was beyond imagination that there would be any rainfall. The match was set to be held at 6.00 pm. But I took an early leave that day and left office at about 4.30 pm. I reached the stadium and took some light snacks from the street shops. Finally, I entered the stadium and took my seat. Everything was in order. I grabbed the seat and started waiting for the match. Luckily, my seat was near the ground and the visibility was clear. But after around half an hour, I had to leave the stadium to get protected from rainfall.\n\nSudden rain is troublesome. Besides, I am a bit more prone to cold. If I get wet in the rain, there were chances that I would catch a cold. So, I had to leave the stadium. Moreover, this was heavy rain. It started suddenly. Initially, it appeared with drizzling and then cats and dogs. So, it was impossible to stay inside the stadium. Further, my seat was in the front row so that I could enjoy the match clearly. So, there were no sheds above my head. As a result, it was impossible for me to stay there. The most frustrating issue was that the ground was filled with water. The players were unable to start the match on the ground. So, the match was abandoned. Considering all the aspects, I had to leave the stadium and return home.  \n\nTo be frank, it was a complete waste of time for me. I had some important tasks to complete and meet the deadlines. But I left them at the office for the next day. On the other side, I could not enjoy the match and had to return home without any special achievement. I think the time was not in my favour. I could not complete my necessary assignment; I was unable to enjoy the match of my preferred team and also got a cold for the raindrops on my head. Actually, planning for the match and visiting the stadium was really a waste of time for me."

    "Answer": "I like to visit different places whenever I get an opportunity. So thank you for this interesting cue card topic since it will allow me to talk about a rather exciting place which I visited about a couple of years ago.\n\nThe place, I visited, was a border town, sitting conveniently on the northeastern part of my country. The city is divided by a beautiful river and the other side of it falls into our neighbouring country. But, the interesting thing is that, for a person, who visits that place for the first time, he or she would never know that this is actually a bordering town since people from both sides of the river frequently can be seen visiting their neighbours in their parts of the city.\n\nAfter seeing this, a couple of my friends, visiting with me, jokingly commented that the people of that bordering city were having an amusing time since they could literally eat their main dishes in our part of the city while enjoying desserts on the other side of the river.\n\nNeedless to say, I also agreed with my friends, and I happened to like their idea so much that, after eating our lunch, we also decided to visit the other side of the town and have our desserts. By the way, as we were visiting the other part of the city in a steamer, I noticed that live music was being played in many of the steamers, crossing the river, by some young musical talents. However, the most memorable thing about this visit was that the people of both parts of the city treated each other as their own neighbours.\n\nWell, I liked visiting this place, mainly because it allowed me to see some of the most friendly and cordial relationships between the people of two countries. I liked visiting this place also because the river there, and the beautifully built houses in rows on its banks, was one the spectacular view I have ever seen."

    "Answer": "Travelling is my passion and I love to explore new places. I even have a wish list of places I would love to go before I die. Among the places I have been to, Sanyou Cave in China is a place that I particularly liked and would love to visit again.\n\nIt was 2005 when I went there with my family members. It would probably be mid-July of 2005 when I had been there. My parents are also fond of travelling to new places and my father actually selected this place for a two week’s tour. I went there with my parents, my elder brother and his wife. We wanted to take my grandmother but she declined the proposal considering her health condition.\n\nSanyou Cave is in the sheer cliff at the northern region of Xiling Gorge. This was about 6 miles away from the Yichang City of China. This is considered as one of the best cave scenery in Asia and the whole part was something unexpected to me.\n\nWalking up the path from the cave to the Zhixin pavilion was the most memorable part of this tour. My father was with me and he said ‘is not it beautiful?’ twice during our walk. I thought I time travelled to a distant past and was part of another time and dimension that I actually live in.\n\nWhen we arrived near the cave and looked around, I was awe-stricken. It was quite surprising for me to witness a place that I never thought would exist. This place reminded me of the movie ‘Time machine’ that I watched many years before. It was so beautiful a place that I liked every moment of our staying there. We spent the night in a hotel established in the cave and that was enthralling. The meaning of the words ‘Sanyou Cave’ is ‘Cave of the Three Travelers’ and it is said that this is a place that inspires people. The exceptional inspiration I got from this place is something I will cherish, probably for the rest of my life."

    "Answer": "Recently my visit to the Glacier National Park gave me immense pleasure after a very long time. This is an area where nature has bestowed her gifts generously to the mountains. The place is also good for hiking. I am really lucky that the memories are still vivid in my mind and here I got the chance to describe them.   \n\nGenerally, I try to take some visits to the nearby locations with my family and sometimes alone. I made this visit all by myself and enjoyed a lot. In fact, this is a rocky area filled with natural beauties. So, the best time to visit the park is in winter, I think. And the view may differ to others. The thought appeared on my mind as I have visited the area in different seasons but only found it is charming most in winter. Hence, I made the visit in the middle of December, last.   \n\nI made a solo visit here at this time. But before this visit, I went there with my family members. In fact, it was a solo visit for different reasons. First of all, I wanted to have some times for myself. I was experiencing huge workloads from my office. By the way, I am a professional computer programmer and work with an international IT agency. So, I have to follow some strict rules and regulations to meet the deadlines. I need to meet targets and other issues within the allotted time. Besides, I need to manage my team of as well consisting of 10 members. As a result, I need to remain busy and even have to attend office for over 13 hours in a day. At the end of the day, I become exhausted and this was the routine for the last couple of months. To remove boredom from life, I decided to take break and moved for the Park to spend an entire day, alone.   \n\nTo me, this is a place for natural beauty. I find a sense of serenity in this place. The wilderness amazes me. the carved peaks and valleys adjacent to the Canadian border are really adorable to look at. Moreover, the memories of hiking and riding on a boat will remain for long. I walked about five kilometres on the hiking trail by over three hours. Besides, riding on the boat was a different experience for me on the lake of the Park. This was also the perfect place for camping but I was unable to camp. I did not have the preparation for camping. Cycling is another adventurous activity here and I have seen many cyclers exploring the area. I will try to bring a bicycle next time whenever I come. The bright night with millions of stars was the other attraction for me.   \n\nI liked the wide glaciers and lakes of the Glacier National Park. This is located in the Montana state in the USA and visited by a large number of people. I like the mountain ranges most here. The mountain ranges are completely different from the other smaller mountains I have seen. Besides, the lakes are on the next of my preference list. I liked swimming in the lakes and fishing as well. The mountains of the Park formed around 170 million years before and still, they are on the same location. However, there are slight changes in the shape and size of the mountains and lakes. Besides, the enriched animal species are loveable as well. This is really a great place to pay a visit."

    "Answer": "We all have health issues from time to time. But, by the grace of almighty, I haven’t had any major health issues in my life so far. But, one of my coworkers had a health problem that caused him much suffering, and today, I will talk about this colleague and his health problem.\n\nMy colleague had a fatty liver problem which he had come to know about a year ago. Prior to that, of course, he was complaining about pain and discomfort in his abdomen, as well as about his constant fatigue. In fact, he became so sick at some point that he couldn’t even come to the office for days in a row. But, he didn’t really care about those health issues since he thought that he was only having some kind of chronic gastric problems.\n\nBy the way, he did have gastric problems many times before that, so it was only natural for him to consider his health problems as some gastric related issues. Besides, he also had a habit of eating all kinds of junk and fatty foods without ever considering negative health effects. Of course, we, at the office, suggested him to cut the amount of fatty food and food with sugar, but he was just never in the mood to listen to our good advice.\n\nHis overweight also played an important role in developing his fatty liver disease. So, again, it was only a matter of time that he was going to have some major health issues like that. However, after going to a doctor and taking some medicines, he started to feel better, albeit very slowly. Besides, he also had to take bed rest for a considerable period of time before actually being able to work again.\n\nAnyway, I felt really bad about the health problem of this co-worker of mine since we always used to laugh and make jokes with each other. Besides, I, together with the other staffs, also was a bit worried about our works at the office since we were struggling to finish our works in his absence."

    "Answer": "Gosh, that seems like quite a personal topic!  I don’t think I feel quite comfortable talking about someone else’s health problem, so I’ll pick one that is about me.  Erm, I’ll tell you what it was, how I had it and how eventually I got better.  I’ll also try and explain a bit about how I felt, though that’s hard to do, so you might have to ask me some extra questions to help me make sense of it!\n\nSo what happened was a post-concussion syndrome.  I had a fall from a horse, it wasn’t even that bad a fall, to be honest.  I’d had a riding lesson, and at the end I was sitting on the horse, standing there just chatting to my instructor, we weren’t even moving.  Then something happened on the yard, possibly a load fell off the back of a lorry, or something similar, which made the loudest noise imaginable, my horse was startled and plunged forward instinctively.  I was unprepared, so just toppled off backwards, hitting my head as I did so.  I always wear a hard hat, so that gave me some protection, but it was a hell of a bang.  In cartoons, you see pictures of people seeing stars after being hit on the head, and that is what it was like!  My vision went, and I saw a bright light, and my how it hurt!  However, I didn’t lose consciousness or anything, and I got back on the horse briefly to reassure myself I wouldn’t lose my nerve.  I put the horse away, untacking and brushing her off, and leaving her with a big pile of hay to eat (it wasn’t her fault, the ‘fright and flight’ reaction is a pure instinct in a prey animal).  I drove home.  I didn’t feel great, and the next couple of days was the weekend so I didn’t go out, I just slept a lot, and felt a bit sorry for myself.\n\nOn Monday, I went into work as usual but felt really peculiar.  It was the first time in a couple of days that I had seen anyone, and I found that it was really difficult to communicate.  I had gaps in my vocabulary, and I was really inappropriately emotional.  The phone on my desk rang, and I just couldn’t answer it, I felt I wouldn’t know what to say.  It was very frightening, I just sat and cried.  A colleague I worked with came in, and it was difficult for me to explain what was wrong as I honestly didn’t know.  She offered to give me a lift home, but I said I’d be OK to make my own way if she would let my boss know.  She knew I must be really poorly, as I’d been working there for over a year and had never before had a day off for anything or even been late to work.  I left the building and then felt quite panicky as I couldn’t remember how to get to the bus stop.  I knew this was bad, but I didn’t know what to do.  I managed to walk home and just went straight to bed.\n\nThe next week was awful, I just slept, and cried and felt really confused.  I knew I wouldn’t be well enough to go to work as I felt very fearful of just going outside.  I made an appointment to see my doctor.  I was very lucky as the person I saw had by chance a particular interest in head injuries.  She explained that everything I was experiencing – the loss of memory, the emotional crying; the fatigue, was actually quite ‘normal’ for some people following an accident of this type.  That was the good news, the bad news is that this is known as a post-concussion syndrome and there isn’t much you can do to get better.  You just have to be patient. However she did say that I’d need to give myself some mental stimulation to help repair the pathways in my brain, so even though it was exhausting and frightening it was important to get out, to go for a walk, or get a cup of coffee.  To begin with, it was very difficult to do these things because I was scared I’d forget where I was and not be able to get home.  I also felt extremely vulnerable because I knew I looked ‘normal’ but might behave in an inappropriate way – like bursting into tears in a shop because they didn’t have the newspaper I wanted.  It’s very difficult to imagine what this is like unless you have experienced it.  You know you are behaving in a way that is odd, and not acceptable, but you simply cannot control it.  I also had a few experiences of meeting people who knew me, but I did not recognise, that was very hard to understand for them and me too!\n\nI ended up having two weeks off work, and even when I did go back I struggled for quite some time.  It was many months before I felt my vocabulary was back and I felt like my thinking was laboured and I was exhausted all the time.\n\nHow did I feel?  Terrified, it was a really horrible experience, and I was very lonely too.  I thought I might not be able to carry on working, and that I would never get better.  I was also worried I would lose my friends because my behaviour was so unpredictable and peculiar.  Still, I try to be positive about these things, and I think it perhaps gave me some understanding and insight into what it must be like for older people with dementia or anyone with an acquired brain injury.  Perhaps it has made me more patient, and now if I see someone doing something odd in the street I consider that they may not mean to be demanding or rude, perhaps they too have had an injury which has changed how they interact with other people.  I feel very lucky that eventually, after about 18 months I am pretty much back to how I was.  I do still really struggle with the names though, and I still don’t always recognise people when I should.  Perhaps I also have that experience of reaching for a memory that isn’t quite there more than I ever did before, but it doesn’t stop me doing anything.\n\nThe human body is an amazing thing, it does have the capacity to heal, but you need to be patient to let it do so.  It is fragile too, and now I think I appreciate that more as well – it makes me mad if I see cyclists or riders without protective headgear – if I hadn’t been wearing my helmet, well, I think the ending would have been very different."

    "Answer": "Sickness creates one of the most uncomfortable situations in human life and when a family member gets sick, other members also go through great anxiety. So, everybody wants to remain fit, sound and healthy even though it is quite natural to become ill sometimes. There are some diseases that you cannot avoid and asthma, in our country, is one of them. My younger sister has suffered from Asthma for quite a while and she is still not cured perfectly. I would like to thank you for this opportunity to let me talk about this topic.\n \nAsthma is a respiratory disorder. When it attacks, the victims have difficulty in breathing. Often they have shortness of breath. Sometimes they become breathless and feel a pressure on the chest. It happens mostly for the inflammation inside the bronchial tubes. But the symptoms are not the same for everyone and may vary from person. Some of the asthma patients get it from allergy while the remaining may have it as non-allergic form. When it is allergic, it may be triggered by any common factors or sources that cause allergy. For the non-allergic asthmas, it can attack at any time without any prior notice.\n\nJessica, my younger is 14 now and have occupied all the features of my mom. Mom is allergic. She cannot endure dust and other usual causes for allergy. Similarly, Jessica also owned such physical features from our mother. When she was 10, she was attacked with asthma for the first time. She felt trouble in her breathing and said that she was also having pressure on her chest. When she was taken to a doctor, initially it was diagnosed as asthma. Later, she was prescribed some tests to make it confirmed. Finally, the test reports described it as allergic asthma and she should be careful about this. The doctor also opined that she got this genetically and might be it from her mother. It was her first attack and an early warning of the health disorder. Hence, she should remain highly careful about the issue.     \n\nAsthma is mostly a respiratory disorder and may deteriorate health to the largest extent if not taken care of in the right way. Besides, like the symptoms, the treatment is not also the same for everyone. The doctor initially prescribed some medications to relieve. Further, he also suggested remain away from the allergy-triggering elements. Usually, it is hard to prevent asthma in mature age and if the symptoms are not shown early. But Jessica is lucky in some aspects. It is expected that asthma will be under control when she is completely matured. But she needs to be careful about the issue. Regularly, she is to take medications whenever she is attacked. The medicines help to relieve the attack and makes the breathing easier. She also carries an inhaler with her always and uses it whenever needed.\n\nJessica is still a young girl. Like all the other girls of her age, she loves to play outside in the garden. But after the asthma attack, she is not able to continue her daily tasks smoothly. She used to care for the flower plants in the garden in the evening but now she is unable to do that fearing another asthma attack from the outside dust. She is highly careful and even avoids foods that may cause allergy. I feel sad when I see her in the situation of breathlessness. Either she needs to take inhaler if she is outside of the home or she takes medicines if she is at home. Unfortunately, my mom and Jessica share the same problem. Though mom has controlled her allergy to a notable level and does not get attacked, Jessica is still immature to control her asthma. So, I am worried about her indeed."

    "Answer": "There are so many historical cities in this world which I have always wanted to visit but have managed to visit only a couple of them so far. Rome is the name of one of those cities, about which I would like to describe here.\n\nNow, everybody knows where Rome is, and how this “eternal” city brims with ancient history. From the Colosseum to the port of Ostia Antica to majestic Vatican City and the Sistine Chapel, the city of Rome, also the capital city of Italy, has it all to lure the visitors from all over the world. Even though the city of Rome is thought to have been founded at around 750 BC, the site has been inhabited much longer, as long as 28 centuries, some say.\n\nKnown for its stunning architecture, with the Colleseum, Pantheon, and Trevi Fountain, Rome was first the centre of the Roman Republic, then of the Roman Empire, and it became the capital of the Christian world in the 4th century.  By the way, I visited this historical city about a few years ago at the invitation of a good friend of mine, who teaches at a university there. Thankfully, it was my teacher friend, who told me so much about the extraordinarily rich history of Rome, which captivated my mind.\n\nAnyway, after arriving in Rome, I went to see the coliseum. Then, later on, I rented a bike and started to ride in the old part of Rome, which is really huge in my opinion, to see the traditional life of the locals. Of course, among other things, I didn’t forget to try some of the most delicious Italian cuisines either.\n\nAnyway, this historical city was worth visiting, it was just not full of history but also art and stunning architecture which swept across entire Europe for thousands of years. It was also worth visiting because it is this historical city which helped Christianity, the religion of the largest number of population of the world, grow during its heyday."

    "Answer": "This is an interesting topic to talk about and I would like to thank you for the opportunity to  let me talk about a historical city I have been to. I love to travel, experience exotic food and learn about different traditions and customs. Alexandria was a very important port city in Egypt and this is the historical city I would like to talk about.\n\nAlexandria was founded in 331 BC in Egypt by Alexander the Great and this is one of the most significant historical city in world history. It is now the second-largest city and the largest seaport in Egypt. After its foundation, it became an important centre for the Hellenistic civilisation. The Roman and the Byzantine ruled Egypt for about a thousand years and then the Muslim conquested it in 641 AD. Alexandria was the second most powerful city in the ancient time and the Lighthouse of Alexandria, Great library, Necropolis and other historic significances of this city make it an important historic city of all time.\n\nI visited this city in 2012 when I was in my 4th semester at my university. It was a study excursion that our university arranged for interested students. Along with a group of 15 students, three teachers also went with us on this excursion. In fact, this was quite a memorable tour for me.\n\nVisiting Alexandria was quite a remarkable experience for me. I love to travel and being in a city which bears evidence of the world history was something  extraordinary. We went to the Temple of Taposiris Magna, roamed the streets in Alexandria, visited Kom El Shoqafa and many other historic places. On our 4th day in this city, we were introduced to a group of university students and we had a  great chance to learn about many aspects of Egypt. On the 6th day, we completed an assessment that one of our teachers gave us. At night, we often walked the streets and enjoyed the nightlife. We also saw the Pompey's Pillar which is one of the best known ancient monuments standing in Alexandria and we did so the day before we left Alexandria."

    "Answer": "During the last summer vacation, I along with my family members, made a trip to Athens in Greece, a historical city in this European continent. Despite being a historical city, it is now filled with numerous tourist destinations. It was a wonderful trip for me. This is really interesting to describe the trip. I would like to thank you for this opportunity to let me talk about a historic city I have been to.\n \nAthens is located in Greece and in fact, this is the capital city of the country. I made a family trip from France to Athens. This was planned a couple of weeks before and it was done to know the city. The city of Athens was the epicentre of Ancient Greece. A large number of civilisations have dominated in the city. There are some most visiting places still remind the golden days of the city. I have visited all the notable places and came to know about the pride of the city. In fact, I came to know about lots of historical information about the city.\n\nI went to Athens during my last summer vacation. Actually, it is really difficult for a student like me to manage time to make a trip. So, it is not possible for me to move with my family every time. It is only the vacations when I can manage times to move from one place to another with the purpose of travelling. Besides, when it is with the family, there are some restrictions imposed. But I did not have to take such troubles in this visit. Though I went with my family, I moved alone in different parts of this historical city. The most interesting issue about the visit is that it was not the season for visit. So, there were fewer crowds and I was able to know the history of the city closely.\n\nI did many things there. Mostly I was engaged with sightseeing. There are many places to see and enjoy nature. Besides, the sunset scenes on the beaches were the other finest things that I enjoyed most while my trip to this city. Food is another interesting thing here. Besides, I visited different historical sites and museums, enjoyed a concert and cultural event at the Technopolis. I also liked walking alone on the sandy beaches and shopping. In fact, shopping was the other interesting thing for me for there were a huge collection of products at the shopping centres and stores. Besides, the coffee shops at the shopping grounds were adorable as well.\n\nEarlier, Athens was the centre of all types of activities and now the scenarios are not changed at all. This is the centre of domination of arts, philosophy, culture, music, learning, commercial activities and so on for the Greeks. The history of this city dates back around over 3000 years. Besides, the presence of this city is also found in some historical literature. The city developed for its connection with the sea. Further, this is the city that is linked with numerous philosophers like Plato and Aristotle. Athens had and still possess an influential impact on the politics of the European continent and owns an enriched life in terms of politics, economics, industrial and maritime aspects. For all such impacts, it has become a cosmopolitan city but still, it bears its ancient and historical legacies. So, I think this is a historical city."

    "Answer": "Not sure, how one would define “long journeys”, but, as far as I am concerned, a journey is considered to be a long journey to me if it lasts more than 10 hours. But, the journey, I want to talk about, lasted for 14 hours when I visited the capital city of my country about 14 years ago for the first time as a young boy.\n\nHowever, when I, together with my uncle and cousin, started my journey, I wasn’t exactly told about the duration of our journey. All I was told that it was going to be a long but exciting journey since it did not only involve travelling by bus but also by a big ferry.\n\nBy the way, back in 14 years, the city, in which I used to live, didn’t have any direct communication facility, either by bus or train since, with the capital city since our region was separated by a very big river from the rest of the country. So, our only option was to first travel by bus almost half of the distance and then use the ferry to travel the rest of it.  \n\nSo, we started our journey in the early morning, and as our bus was cruising along nicely, my uncle and cousin (both were considerably older than me) were introducing me to the places and cities that we were passing through. After, finishing our bus journey after almost 6 hours, we finally began our journey on a huge ferry boat. We travelled almost 8 hours on that ferry but it felt like only a few hours since it was one of the most wonderful and comfortable journeys of my life till then.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed this long journey, mainly because it allowed me to see some new and cool places for the first time outside of my own city. I enjoyed it also because it is during this journey that I was treated like an adult for the first time by the people who were travelling with me and around me."

    "Answer": "I love to travel and explore new places and that is why I would be very glad to talk about a long journey that I enjoyed. I also thank you for this great topic and time to let me talk about a journey that was long and I liked it.\n\nBack in 2009, I had a really long tour in different European countries and this the journey I enjoyed thoroughly. It took us 28 days to finish this tour and I had three classmates and a cousin with me on this journey. We went to Berlin, Paris, Transylvania, London, Vienna, Lisbon and Munich. This was completely a road trip and we never once travelled on an aeroplane during this journey.\n\nThis was a fascinating expedition and the best one I ever had. As a fresh graduate, I had been struggling to find a decent job here in my country. After I had this journey, something changed inside me. I realised that having a job in a large company is not the only ambition in life. This journey revealed so much different cultural and traditional aspects in front of us. We explored many new cities where we have never been to. Many of these cities were historically significant and we enjoyed our time there a lot.  The journey also helped me have a better relationship with my friends. I discovered some of my interests that I never bothered about before. If I never had this journey, I would not take up keeping a journal or photography as my passions.\n\nEvery city we visited has historic significance and we  visited several museums  in these cities. We mostly travelled by trains and enjoyed the views of the roadsides. We met some of the foreigners and enjoyed our conversations. Visiting museums and several other historic places have enhanced my knowledge of history and broaden my thinking pattern. Being away from home for a long time also helped me realise for the first time in my life how much my family and home mean to me! I would say that I liked almost everything about this journey. The timing could not have been more perfect, my companions were great, I explored some of the most beautiful places in the world, I reinvented myself, learned history, traditions and came back revived from this journey. It would not have been any better than this!"

    "Answer": "Travelling is a hobby for me. I love to travel to different countries and have already travelled to some of the European countries. Recently I made a trip to Italy from France. I am happy to discuss the topic here and would like to thank you for the opportunity to describe it.\n \nBeing a French, I have already visited almost all the notable places in the country. So, it was my time to visit the other countries in my region, Europe. So, I made the plan to visit Italy and it was a random selection. Besides, the communication between France and Italy is also convenient and fast. The train is one of the fastest ways to reach Italy from France. Accordingly, I made the plan to visit Italy on the first day of November in yesteryear.  \n\nI live in Paris with my family. In fact, I was born in Paris. So, this is the familiar city for me and I started my journey from this city. Actually, I started the trip from Paris station and it ended at Ventimiglia in Italy. It was interesting for me to travel in another country and alone. As it was a long-distance and took around night to reach Italy, I booked a sleeping car with attached bathroom facility. It took around over six hours to reach in Italy from France by train. The train ran at a great speed indeed. The speed was around 180 kilometres per hour. But it was really hard for me to manage the ticket. Usually, sleeper cars are a bit expensive and it is difficult to manage the ticket without any pre-booking. Fortunately, my uncle, working in the railway managed the ticket for me after enduring lots of troubles.  \n\nI made the journey by myself. Though my younger brother wanted to accompany me, I did not allow him for some reasons. If he came with me, I had to look after him and this is really filled with difficulties to look at another individual on such trips. I had a plan to visit the notable parts of the country and accordingly made the arrangements. I made the hotel reservation and even reserved a car as well to take at the interesting places in Italy. But the most impressive part was the train journey. I never made such a long journey in train. I passed the night sleepless and watched a movie on my laptop. I think I took the right decision that I did not bring my sibling on this journey. If he was with me, I could not have enjoyed myself so much as I did it alone.\n\nI liked the speed of the train most. It appears that this is a fast route between France and Italy. It takes about six and a half hours to reach in Ventimiglia from Paris station. Besides, the facilities on the train were excellent. I visited different parts of the country and stayed there for about a week. In this time, I have enjoyed the natural views, golden beaches, met with a large number of people and knew about their cultures, took part in different activities and more. The most important thing in Italy that attracted me was the traditional food items. I enjoyed them greatly. After passing the week, I returned by the same train in Paris. It was a great journey for me indeed."

So, it is no surprise that I find many people around me to be similar to me, as far as the behaviour and personality are concerned, and today, I would like to talk about one of them here.\n\nThe person, I am talking about, is a distant cousin of mine. Although we are distant cousins, we have a very warm relationship with each other. In fact, we grew up together even though, we have an age difference of almost 2 years between us. But that age barrier never stopped us from playing soccer together in the same team or enjoying a movie at a theatre.\n\nBy the way, I and this cousin of mine aren’t exactly considered “friends”, but we are more than friends. In fact, we are like brothers to each other with a rather strong brotherly bond where anything goes.\n\nTo introduce this distant cousin of mine, he is a university graduate and studied accounting. But, even though, he is a very bright student with distinct academic performance, he never really went for any job. Instead, he chose business as a career. He is about 6 feet tall and has a rather strong physical built like me. There is no doubt that I like my cousin a lot, but other people around him have some mixed feelings and thoughts about him, as some of them consider him friendly while the others think of him as a rather arrogant and rude person because of his “straight talks”. But, whatever he may be, all people around him consider him as a very hard working person.\n\nAnyway, my cousin is similar to me in three aspects. First one is, of course, we both like to wear white t-shirts and jeans and have somewhat similar physical build. The second one is, we both like our coffee to be really strong and hot. Finally, the third one is that we both like to save up as much money as possible without ever wasting them."

    "Answer": "Well, people often say that I have many striking resemblances with my elder brother John. If I have to choose someone whom I consider to be like me, I would also choose my brother John. His full name is Alfred John and he is 4 years senior to me. He is an architect and working as a project lead in a large international organisation for the last couple of years.\n\nHis physical appearance, height, body structure and complexion are quite similar to mine. I can recall two/three events when a distant relative thought I was John. People often make this mistake especially when I wear formal dresses (like my brother most of the time does) and they look at me from a reasonable distance.\n\nApart from the remarkable outer similarities between us, we have many common interests and similar ways of thinking. We like the same type of foods, music, movies and sports. We are in fact really good buddy when we play together or compete with others. We have common interests like our passion for gardening, reading, travelling and collecting coins. We both love to learn new technologies and that makes us common minded. Sometimes he gives his opinion in many family-related and political issues that I find quite as the reflections of my thoughts.\n\nTo my parents and others, he is a great human being and an example of an ideal son. Apart from my mother, others think that he is quite exceptionally brilliant! My mother still considers him as a fragile kid who needs here affection and advice to survive.\n\nI consider him as a brother only lucky people can have! To me, he is a friend, a mentor and an example in life. The most important similarity I wish to possess is the morality and kindness he has for others."

    "Answer": "Usually, kids look similar to their parents. Some of them might look like their father while some others like the mother. My relatives are on the view that I am almost a copy of my mother. She was the same as I am today in my 24. This is an important issue for me and in fact, I am really glad to have a chance to discuss this interesting topic.\n \nMy mother is a middle-aged woman and she is a housewife. She is not that much healthy and maintains her diet chart perfectly. She also loves to listen to soft music and sing songs too in family functions. In her early life, she had spent the days in different parts of the world due to my grandfather’s profession as a diplomat. So, she is well familiar with different cultures and other issues. Besides, she knows several languages at the same time and learnt during her school days. She is very kind and generous to people. So, everyone loves my mom very much.  \n\nBefore getting married, she was a school teacher here in Thailand. My dad settled here from Taiwan and got married to my mom. After their marriage, mom had to give up her teaching profession. She had to give up her career to perfectly maintain the entire family. When my father settled down in Thailand with his business, he brought his other family members to reside permanently in Thailand. It was really a brave decision and my mom had to manage everything. Even in the present days, she is the key to everything at our home. She is the example of a perfect housewife. She takes care of every single member of the family, personally. She fixes the menu for the day, how many maids will work on the day, daily shopping, and much more.\n\nMy mom is a quite popular figure in my entire family. She loves to socialize and knows very well how to entertain people. In fact, she entertains people with her heart and in returns, she wins their love. Everyone respects her for her benevolent nature and kindness. She also has a great impact on our neighbours. She moves forward in each of their needs. Since she has no other tasks other than maintaining the family, she gets enough time to help the neighbourhood. Many of them are dependent on my mom for her extraordinary intelligence. She can solve critical problems instantly. Moreover, with the charming attitude, she makes everyone as her fan. This is really fun to enjoy.   \n\nMany of the people, familiar to my family, have said that I look like my mom. And this is true to many extents. My face has a similarity with my mom’s face. She had a similar robustness as I have today. My grandmother told me the stories of my mom. When she was in my age, she used to do similar things. But she was a bit calm while I am a bit unstable in nature. I am similar not only with her in physical terms, I have a striking similarity of nature with my mom. For instance, my hobbies are similar to those that my mom had in my age. I enjoy music, movies, love reading books while my hobbies were the same for my mom. This is really a miracle for me and I am happy with the similarities with my mom indeed. I love my mom and consider her to be a great person. so when people, especially my relatives compare me with my mom, I feel happy about it. I wish I would be able to become as great as my mom is now!"

Of course, different people have different ways of relaxation while I have my own favourite way.\n\nAnyway, my favourite way to relax is to either enjoy some nice old movies while also eating my favourite snacks. Of course, this wasn’t exactly my favourite way to relax even before a few years ago when I was doing a desk job as a senior audit manager at one of the largest and renowned accounting firms of my country. Back then, my favourite way to relax was to do the outdoors and try to connect with nature since all I did was to crunch the numbers the whole day.\n\nBut, then, I changed my profession and became a General Sales Manager at a big car dealer’s shop (which I really love, by the way). As a general manager, of course, I need to be on the constant run at my current job to help and talk to my prospective car buyers, and as a result, I become really physically exhausted at the end of the day. And there just doesn’t seem to be a better way to get rid of my clumsy tiredness than to just hop on my sofa and turn on my DVD player in order to watch some of my most favourite old movies that I used to watch as a junior college and university student.\n\nBy the way, my favourite time to relax is between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm because, after that, I run on my treadmill machine for about 40 minutes before taking a fresh shower.  \n\nAnyway, this is my favourite way of relaxation because it is very effective in unwinding my tense muscles because of all those running and moving at work. It is my favourite also because it helps me bring back some of my happiest memories from my student life as I consider my student life as the golden era of my life."

    "Answer": "My favourite way to relax is a bit strange and my parents often find it hard to believe that I love to relax in this way. Well, this is not the only way I relax but definitely, this is my favourite one. To me relaxing and serenity is related. So I close the doors and windows of my room and lit a low powered light bulb to cut the outside noise and bright light. I live in a busy urban area so it’s usually noisy around me.\n\nThen I turn on the CD player and play either Pink Floyd or Enigma in a low volume. Then I close my eyes and try to recall my happy memories of my childhood. This gives me immense pleasure as most of my childhood memories are spellbinding and magical. If I spend about half an hour this way I start feeling a sensation that is utmost pleasant. I remain half awake and half asleep and an hour is good enough for me to get fully recharged and refreshed.\n\nI usually do it at home, more specifically in my room. Whenever I feel stressed or depressed I try to relax in this way to eliminate my stress and depression. I would not say it works all the time but I find it very effective. I guess during this process I try to feel happy as I get lost in my childhood and that’s something I have psychologically accepted as a remedy to my depressions and mental stress. Since I have been doing it for a while and my body and mind have got adjusted with this process, it works like a panacea to me.\n\nMy second best way of relaxation is reading books or visiting a naturally beautiful place. But the one I told you is most effective for me."

    "Answer": "I am unable to manage much time for relaxation and it's my profession that does not allow me to relax a lot. But whenever I can manage time, I opt for cycling. In fact, it has become the favourite way to relax amid the busy schedule. I would like to thank you for this nice candidate task card.\n \nI am a businessman and deal with cosmetics and toiletries import here in Singapore. I supply imported cosmetics and toiletries products from different countries to local distributors. This is a really profitable business for me. Hence, I have to remain busy round the week. I cannot manage time for relaxation or socialise much. Therefore, I took cycling as my favourite way to relax. On the weekend, I move out with my bicycle and move across the city. Though this is a bit difficult for me to ride a bicycle in this middle age, I enjoy the ride to the fullest extent.  \n\nUsually, I start cycling on the weekends. I ride on the bicycle that I imported from Indonesia. It runs smooth and requires less maintenance. Generally, I start the ride early in the morning. Actually, with the advancement of the day, it is difficult indeed to ride a bicycle smoothly on the streets. So, I do the cycling in the morning hours. Besides, the environment remains calm and quiet. It brings a sense of comfort in me. My inner faculty becomes relaxed. I get out of the home with my bicycle even before the sunrise. As a result, I do not have to experience the hustle and bustle of city life. Besides, morning hours have a different appeal to me. When I ride on the bicycle, move along the streets and whistle by my own mind, the feelings are definitely great.      \n\nThis is an effective method to make me feel refreshed. In fact, people have different other ways to relax and they enjoy their ways. I like this one for some of the special benefits. First of all, cycling is a good exercise. While cycling, it burns fat from our body. Besides, it helps to keep us fit. It also helps to build the leg muscles stronger. Moreover, one can travel a long distance with the bicycle and see lots of surrounding things. Considering all the aspects, I am really benefitted with this habit. When I ride in the early morning, I feel close to nature. It brings a sense of satisfaction inside me. There is no chaos on the street and even fewer people. So, this appears an effective method for my relaxation.\n\nI like this way of relaxation for some certain causes. Riding on a bicycle is really enjoying. It provides a special pleasure to the riders. Moreover, it is attractive for its advantageous impacts on the riders. It helps to focus on specific issues and thus increases the focusing skills. The most important benefit of this cycling is it helps to keep the riders fit. As a bicycle rider, I am fit than any other individual. My mind remains fresh on the day I ride on. Furthermore, when I ride, I do not ponder over my business or any other activities. It helps to make my mind free from worries and agonies. Thereby, I can think clearly later and take necessary decisions when needed. So, this is my favourite way of relaxation."

    "Answer": "I live in one of the least populated regions of my country which only has about half a million people. Located in the north-eastern part of my country, the city is not exactly known to many people in my country. But, as far I am concerned, this city has always been very special to me, and here I would like to tell you why in a minute.\n\nAnyway, even though, this isn’t exactly a famous place, like many other cities of my country, the legend has it that it is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, regions of my country where people have been living for more than 500 years. Since most of the people here are either involved with farming or small businesses, only a very few industries or companies can be found there. Of course, recently, some agro-based industries are trying to make their ways into this medium-sized city of ours, but the common people there, including me, aren’t too happy or excited about it as it will most likely raise the cost of living of an otherwise very ‘inexpensive” town.\n\nBut, inexpensive or not, I have always loved each and everything about this city, especially, its downtown area which is always lively with lots of people, trying to enjoy their afternoon snacks and tea. By the way, I don’t only like this downtown area of my city, but also it happens to be the most familiar part of my city to me because it is in the wide streets of this area where I grew up riding my bicycle and hanging out with my friends as a young boy. The city has a few important landmarks too which includes a very old church, a big public library and a big lake.  \n\nAnyway, a couple of things make this city very special to me. First thing, of course, is that I have grown up here with all kinds of happy memories. Second thing is that I really like the laid-back and easy-going lifestyle of our people here."

    "Answer": "I am originally from Nepal and I have spent most of my life at Kathmandu, which is my place of birth. However, during my graduation period, I had to live in Dhaka, which is the capital city of Bangladesh and is a wonderful city. I stayed in this city for about 5 years and this is the city I would talk about for my cue card topic.\n\nAccording to the official map, Dhaka is located in the middle of Bangladesh. Dhaka is a small city but it is quite crowded and busy. Set beside the Buriganga River Dhaka city has an area of 315 square miles. In the 17th century, Dhaka was the Mughal capital of Bengal and it still has many old architectural works and buildings of this era.\n\nI stayed at the Dhaka University campus which is near the Shahbagh area and this is the area I was most familiar with. To be honest this is a spectacular and lively city and the rich tradition and Bengali culture make it a unique city. There are a lot of famous and important landmarks in this city including Lalbagh Fort, Liberation War Museum, Ahsan Manzil, Sonargaon, National Museum, National Parliament House, War memorial monument, Sixty Dome Mosque and so on. Interestingly I have visited all of these significant landmarks in Dhaka except Sixty Dome Mosque. I personally enjoyed visiting the Ahsan Manzil, Sonargaon and War memorial monument. The old Dhaka is a unique place with old and traditional buildings and the distinctive lifestyle of people. The university campus was another fascinating place for me. I often went to the new market for shopping and Nilkhet was a very popular place for book lovers.\n\nI believe that the university years are quite memorable and pleasant years for everyone. In fact, I had some of the best years of my life while I was at my university. I spent those golden years in this very city and made many good friends during this time. The friendly people, colourful festivals, pleasant memories, comfortable weather and my exposure to a different culture are the reasons I will never forget this city. This will always be a city I would love to visit and my pleasant time in this city makes it very special to me."

    "Answer": "When I was an undergrad student in India, I used to live in New Delhi. This is one of the most adorable cities I have ever visited. This is also the capital city of India and enriched with numerous historical evidence and events. I am lucky to have this topic for my discussion.\n \nNew Delhi is one of the largest cities in India. Its foundation was laid in 1911. The city design was done by two British architects. As a capital, the city was opened in 1931 and since then it has been playing roles in the advancement of the country. Presently, this is one of the attractive and massive metropolitan areas as well. This city also contains a good number of architectural edifices of different ages, street shops, foods, markets, and overall human resources.     \n\nNew Delhi is a vast city and growing rapidly. The scenarios of the city have been changed after the independence of the country while they were different before independence. The city has different parts and almost all of them are commercially developed. I am familiar with the most notable parts of the city. In fact, I am a non-native here. My family lives in Philippine and I came to India for my graduation with a scholarship at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi which is located in Hauz Khas in New Delhi. As a student, I had to remain occupied with my academic studies and could not manage time for wandering here and there randomly. But I have visited the most attractive spots in the city.\n\nThe city comes up with many attractions for its visitors. First of all, there are some museums and historic sites still available and they are taken care of in an exact manner. The National Museum, one of the largest museums of India is located in the city. Further, the India Gate is another landmark for the city. The Gate was built in 1931. The gate has been made with the commemoration of 90,000 Indian soldiers who sacrificed lives in the First World War for the British Raj. Besides, the Rajpath is another landmark for the city and it holds the Republic Day parade each year. The resting place of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi is also located here in Rajghat. The location is beside the River Yamuna. Another astronomical observatory named Jantar Mantar is also located in the city. Some other museums like the National Gallery of Modern Art, National Rail Museum etc. are also placed in this city.\n\nI like the city for several reasons. This is really a great city to stay and enjoy. New Delhi is decorated with gardens while the gardens look beautiful when the flowers bloom. I have paid visits to almost all of the parks and have spent quality times with my buddies. The city is also special to me for its variety of foods and drinks. I was in love with traditional Indian foods. The inhabitants were also cordial too. They loved me like their own brother. Moreover, in my educational institute, all the teachers and staffs cared for me and tried to comfort me in every possible way. I have lived here for five consecutive years and will come back if possible to pay another visit."

    "Answer": "Like many countries, my country has also gone through a number of important technological advancements.  But, today, I would like to talk about technological advancement which has made travel and transport within our own country really fast and comfortable.\n\nTalking about domestic air travel or airline industry here. Even before 30 years or so, my country had only a few passenger aircraft in its airline fleet to carry its citizens internally from one part of our country to another.\n\nOf course, the need for a domestic airline industry wasn’t that great either because most people in my country back then considered flying or travelling in an aeroplane as some matter of “luxury”. Besides the airfare was so costly that only a handful of very rich and “aristocratic” people could afford to fly a domestic aeroplane.\n\nBut, things slowly started to change for better when a group of brave and visionary entrepreneurs decided that they were going to make air travel easily accessible to the common people of my country instead of just some very rich people. So, they slowly but surely started to add more and more passenger aircraft in their fleets of domestic airlines in order to operate among the major cities of my country.\n\nAnd because of this very bold initiative of theirs, the number of domestic flights increased from just 2 per week to more than 100 flights per day within just one year or so. Not only that but also, the cost of flying a domestic airline became so affordable that even a person with minimum income can now travel to the farthest point of my country without breaking his or her pocket.   \n\nWell, the effect of this domestic airline industry has so far had a tremendous impact on the local tourism industry of our country as people now can easily travel to their preferred location or destinations literally in minutes. Besides, this technological advancement has made the executives and normal workers alike more productive and efficient in getting more things done by saving time."

    "Answer": "The wide-spread use of the internet and the availability of cheap and advanced mobile devices have made eCommerce very popular in our country. eCommerce, in my opinion, is so far the most important technological advancement in our country which has redefined the selling and purchasing of goods and services.\n\nWith the popularity of the Internet and computer technology, the opportunity for the booming of eCommerce business occurred around 10-12 years ago in our country. In fact, it happened as soon as the concept of eCommerce business was accepted globally. A huge number of Internet users, a great potential for business owners, availability and facility of online payment, quick and safe shipment facilities, development of Information Technology sector in our country and above all people’s spontaneous participation have contributed towards the advancement of eCommerce technology. Facebook is quite popular in our country and the concept of Facebook commerce or F-commerce has also become popular as thousands of store owners have started selling products through Facebook stores or Facebook pages. F-commerce is another form of eCommerce or electronic commerce which is also gaining its popularity.\n\nTechnological advancement is ever-changing, and it does not have a finish line. Thus we cannot say for sure that eCommerce technology is fully developed and requires no further advancement. However, the advancement that has already happened in this field took more than 10 years in our country. I can still recall the days when eCommerce was in its early stage and only a very small number of people actually knew about it. However, the total number of online merchants, customers, and online transactions per day is quite huge now.\n\nAdvancement of eCommerce technology has had an ample effect on the mass people, online store owners and on the overall trade and business in our country. There are scarcely any businesses here that do not have some shorts of online presence. The eCommerce is no longer an option, it has become a must. The way people purchase their daily necessities and the way merchants reach to the customers have changed dramatically.\n\nWithout an online presence, businesses cannot stay in competition these days. Many small business owners have tapped into the eCommerce world and gained brand popularity and have enhanced their business opportunities to a large extent. Stores are no longer restricted to a physical location with fixed business hours. Online stores are now open 24/7 and reach people anywhere in the country or beyond the borders. The number of online shops is rapidly increasing and those stores have gained their popularity among the citizens of our country. In many cases, those stores do not have a particular physical shop and this has all been possible only because of the advancement of eCommerce technology. People no longer need to visit a shop to purchase a product. They can virtually order any product from anywhere and get it delivered in a few hours. The purchase, payment and delivery are all connected via secured connections and it is a revolutionary way of selling and purchasing products and services."

    "Answer": "Technology is the key to the development of a nation. India has significantly advanced in this arena especially sectors like nuclear and space science. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the issue and I would like to thank you for this nice cue card topic.\n \nIndia has advanced in nuclear technology and space science. Regarding nuclear technology, achievements are significant. In fact, nuclear is a great source of electricity for the country. There are 21 active nuclear reactors are in operation across India and all the sources produce a combined amount of over 30,000 GWh of electricity. To meet the increasing demands of electricity, six more nuclear reactor constructions are underway. The progress of India in space science is also noteworthy. Indian Space Research Organization, better known as ISRO is the space authority for the country. It was formed in 1969 and since then it has undertaken a huge amount of activities to explore the space. Already a couple of satellites have been launched to space and they are in good condition.\n\nBut the beginning of the technological advancements was not smooth. They experienced a huge number of negative impacts especially the establishment of nuclear reactors in different parts of India had to face huge protests from the public regarding the detrimental impacts of nuclear reactors. Despite being the fourth-largest source of electricity in India, the people were against the installation of the nuclear power plant. Even the state government of West Bengal also denied the plea for installing a plant under its region. Moreover, public interest litigation was also filed against the Indian Government. On the other side, space research had to face fewer challenges like nuclear reactors. Rather the ISRO had some favours from the State. It has launched a large number of communication satellites to space and still is planning for some improved satellites and launch vehicles.     \n\nThe beginning of both nuclear and space research was not smooth for the country. They had to experience hardship and struggle. Advancements were not made overnight. Establishment of nuclear power plants was the most challenging task for the government. The mitigation of the legal suits was really troublesome. Besides, failure in sending satellites was the most common issue for the ISRO. Initially, it had to launch satellites with external help. With gradual attempts, it has become a self-reliant entity. Besides, in some of the parts of the country, nuclear power plants are still believed to be harmful to the environment and ecology. Hence, the attempts to install some other nuclear power plants are still on the card – not being implemented.\n\nWith the advancement of nuclear and space research, the people of India are having many benefits than the other Asian countries. First of all, the communication system has been improved. With the launch of numerous communication satellites, the overall communication system has been improved. Now the people of India can communicate with the global population within a second. Besides, with the use of nuclear power, electricity is generated and thus the people are enjoying continuous electricity. Moreover, the production level has also increased to a great extent. The remote parts of the country have come under the electricity and the internet and the overall living standards of the Indians have improved. As a result, people are enjoying the benefits of the technological advancement of the country."

    "Answer": "I love to take part in different kinds of social and physical activities. But, of course, time is always in short supply when you are working and studying at the same time. Still, I managed to take part in an activity which I really enjoyed, and today, I would like to talk about that here.\n\nThe activity was related to creating awareness against driving fast on our roads and streets. Such an important activity was long overdue, especially, in our crowded city which has seen an alarming spike in the number of road accidents in recent months.\n\nBecause of this spike in the rate of road accidents, not only our city authority was concerned but also the regular residents like us. Therefore, something needed to be done to address this issue. But, of course, before anything else, the concerned authority needed to find out the root cause for these road accidents, and after gathering all necessary data and information, they found out that driving over the speed limit was mainly causing such accidents.\n\nAnyway, after finding out this reason, the city authority asked for volunteers from all the localities in our city to take part in a campaign in order to raise awareness against driving carelessly. From my locality, along with a dozen volunteers, I also joined the campaign because just before the campaign, one of my cousins also got hit by a careless driver. My cousin, of course, was lucky to survive the accident without any major injuries, but the trauma, she suffered, because the accident was devastating. So, it was time for me also to voice out my concern, and the activity offered me a perfect opportunity for that.\n\nWell, I felt really glad that I actually got a chance to take part in that activity and thus also making my voice count. Besides, taking part in this activity also allowed me to learn a valuable lesson, and the lesson was that it was always better to be safe than to be sorry."

    "Answer": "Recently I took part in a social activity which I would like to talk about for this cue card topic. It was a social campaign to inform everyone in our community about the vaccination for children. This was an important vaccination project that the government was funding and our objective was to inform everyone in our community so that children from 6 months till 5 years old get it for free from the designated centres on the due date. The awareness campaign was organised by our university and I participated in it to be a part of an important social cause. It was a 3-day long campaign and I felt really great to be able to deliver an important message to every single community member.\n\nIn fact, this was not the first time I participated in such an activity. My mother is a social worker and from her, I learned the importance of being a part of such great activities. Last month when I heard that one of our university teachers was looking for a few students to contribute to this campaign, I did not hesitate to be enlisted.\n\nBefore we started knocking on the doors of each community member, a government organisation sent a three members’ team to train us. It was more like professional training and workshop where we were taught about our duties during the campaign. We were handed over a list of our community members and their probable time of being home. We had to make another list with the name, address, child’s age and the type of vaccine they are supposed to be given. We had a supervisor in our team from the beginning of this campaign and he guided us whenever we needed his advice. I would say that the organisation of this campaign was quite thorough and structured.\n\nHonestly, I felt so happy and contented about this whole activity. I knew how important it was to deliver the message to all our community members so that they do not miss their children’s vaccination. I thought it was a great social work which would be quite helpful for the members of our community and did not hesitate to take part in it. I have always felt quite excited and happy about being part of any noble and helpful activity and the vaccination campaign was no exception."

    "Answer": "I am really glad to have this topic for the discussion. In fact, I had been planning to take part in some sort of physical activity as I am gaining unnecessary pounds which I do not want to. Swimming appeared the best solution for me. Accordingly, to learn swimming I took admission at a local swimming club and that is a recent activity that I would like to talk about.  \n\nSwimming is one of the greatest physical activities and I believe that this is a perfect match for me. Swimming has some advantageous aspects. It helps to keep the body fit. It also helps to refresh the body and mind. The other physical benefits include – it helps to improve breathing, improves muscles especially shoulder muscles, keeps the mind calm and more others. Further, it is also helpful to save lives in danger. Considering all the positive aspects, I decided to take part in swimming.    \n\nI took part in swimming to reduce my weight. I met a nutritionist and she suggested me with a diet chart and prescribed some sort of physical exercise. She suggested to walk, but it is really difficult for me to manage the time to walk around the city. After pondering on the physical exercise issue, I decided to swim. Before joining the swimming club, I did not have the slightest idea about swimming but now I am skilled enough. I have been joining the club for the past couple of weeks. Being an engineering student, it is really hard for me to manage extra hours for swimming. Thus I go to the club twice in a week. By the time, I have learnt the swimming basics. Gradually I am getting skilled in different sorts of swimming styles. I like freestyle swimming more than any other styles.    \n\nI live in Sydney. Life is really mechanised here. So, to lead a healthy lifestyle, people need some sort of physical activity. Accordingly, I took part in this activity. Before starting the full-fledged swimming, I needed to learn it. So, I joined the Swimmers’ Club to learn swimming completely. This club has been formed to teach swimming to the civilians. Besides, the learning cost is also affordable for everyone. The club was formed in the last part of 2014 but is now growing rapidly. The instructors are extremely cooperative. In fact, without their direct help, it would not have been possible for me to learn the basic techniques of swimming within a short time.  \n\nI really feel good about swimming. This appears the very best way for me that keeps me fit. Before joining the club, I was gaining weight. It happened due to my lazy lifestyle. And still, I am. But the laziness has been reduced to a great extent. I have started participating in swimming. It helps me to cut my weight. I have lost an extra three pounds within two weeks of swimming. I swim for four hours in a week and it is helping to remain fit. Usually, I pass more times by sitting and hence, I started feeling some disorders. But after learning and practising swimming, I have started feeling better. I have gained mental satisfaction. My muscles are strong now. Besides, I have gained confidence as well. Actually, I am feeling quite fine now than ever before after taking part in swimming."

    "Answer": "I have a soft corner for those TV programmes which try to focus on the life of the country people like us. One such TV show is called “Trailer Park Boys”, which I really enjoy watching, and today I would like to talk about that here.\n\nThey are called the “Trailer Park Boys” for a reason, and the reason is that they are foul-mouthed, violent, often drunk, and even more often at least a little stoned (“stoned” is Canadian slang for being “high” or “wasted”).\n\nBe them as they may be, but they also may just be Canada’s all-time most successful export. Of course, people, who are not really that much fond of this “mockumentary” (yes, it is indeed called “mockumentary instead of “documentary”) television series, they will most likely disagree with me on that “most successful export” part, but I just don’t have any other way to put it here because this is one of the funniest, in its purest form, programmes I have ever seen on TV.\n\nAnyway, to introduce this TV show a little, it focuses on the misadventures of a group of outrageous trailer park residents (these are the temporary mobile homes which are mostly used by poor people in the USA and Canada), some of whom are ex-convicts, living in the fictional Sunnyvale Trailer Park in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Created and directed by Mike Clattenburg. The comedy mockumentary stars Mike Smith (Bubbles), Robb Wells (Ricky) and John Paul Tremblay (Julian).  \n\nThere are so many things about this show which make it really interesting but what I like the most about this show is that the casts in it don’t only try to entertain their audience but also themselves in real-time.\n\nThis show is so popular in my country primarily because it is an absolute laugh-fest and its titular characters are endlessly entertaining. It is so popular also because the show dared to go outside of the Canadian mainstream comedies, and that too in a very masterful manner, in order to entertain its audience."

    "Answer": "‘Far from the line’ is a very popular TV show in our country among more than 20 million viewers who enjoy this show a lot. In a recent online poll, this TV programme was selected as the second most popular TV show of all time in our country.\n\nThis is an investigative news story programme that deals with the crime and unlawful activities in our society as well as important events in history. Some of the episodes deal with the details and facts on notorious events of history. Other episodes introduce social unjust and crimes happening around us. It also alerts us about the types of crimes common in our country and notifies us about the corruptions. Sometimes, this programme interviews famous lawyers, politicians, law-enforcing members, witnesses and victims to give more details about a crime. Finally, some episodes present the backgrounds of a murder or a heinous crime that got media attention. Thus the topic of this programme has a great variety but the objective remains the same-  aware people. To unveil a crime and to aware people is the main reason this programme is aired and this is a successful TV programme so far.\n\nI like the way this programme is presented and the news presenters, anchors and investigators are quite brilliant and the composition of different events in this programme is actually remarkable. I like the idea of informing people about law, crime, criminals and social unjust. In my opinion, this programme is quite helpful to inform citizens about the type of crimes they should be more cautious about.  It also explains the basic laws, civil rights and how to inform authority in case anyone has information about a probable crime or unjust. The way this programme is presented and the variations and exciting facts the programme-makers can bring in each new episode is really praiseworthy and the main reason for its popularity. People in my country love programmes that educate people and are entertaining at the same time. The programme ‘Far from the line’ is a perfect blend of important news, messages, excitement and entertainment and this, in my opinion, is the mantra of its popularity."

    "Answer": "The television shows are one of the important sources of entertainment in Australia. A large number of viewers enjoy television shows.\n'Underbelly' was one of the shows that gained huge popularity across the country. Now I will discuss the show in detail and would like to thank you for the time you allowed me to talk about this topic.\n\n'Underbelly' is a crime drama series. The series has been made based on some true stories of the Australian underworld. All of the events shown in the series were adapted from real-life facts. Hence, the series gained fame among the viewers. A total of six series has been aired so far and another series is on a card for broadcast in 2017. For its huge popularity in Australia, decisions were made to remake a US series over the same theme. But the stories would be different. They will deal with the US gangsters.\n\nThe series is about crime stories of the Australian underworld. A good number of things happen in the underworld but not all of them are made public. The range of such events varies from simple corruption to murder. The show mostly focuses on the issues that may appear attractive to the audiences. The first series was made based on a book about Australian underworld. The book was written by two brave journalists of the country who did not fear to expose the real events. The title was borrowed from another series compilation of the same name and authors. The entire series has been made based on books and novels by different authors published at different times. Each of the books was based on specific gangsters and their activities.\n\nI like the series for some reasons. First of all, they are about the real-life events of the gangsters. Usually, people have some usual notions about the life of gangsters – how they live, how they deal with people, how they commit crimes and more. Hence, the series is really interesting. Besides, the series also showed how the gangsters survived in different situations. The interesting part was their imprisonment. The capturing scenes and desperate gunfights also attracted me. in fact, it was their attempt to survive from the situations and being captured by the law enforcers. Besides, I like it most as there were variations on each of the seasons. Dealing with the drug smugglers and outlaws, manhunt etc. appeared really exciting to me.\n\n'Underbelly' is popular in Australia for various reasons. The topmost influential cause behind its popularity is the real-life issues. Usually, people in the country are busy with their respective tasks and have less time to spend on their entertainment. The time they get is merely enough to derive pleasure from indoor and outdoor activities. So, television shows are the only ways to be entertained and this show is really an excellent one. The plots are attractive and thrilling as well. The manhunt, infiltration of law enforcers in the gangs, dealing with gang members, murders of police, Mafia activities and their revenge etc. everything has been portrayed as they are in real-life. Hence, the series gained its attraction among the nationwide audiences."

    "Answer": "This is one of my most favourite subjects to talk, so thank you very much for this nice cue card topic. Anyway, different people choose different sports as their favourite while I have chosen my own. My favourite sport is football, and I will tell you why in a minute.\n\nBut, football or soccer wasn’t really my favourite game all the time because I liked to play cricket and considered as my favourite sport up and until my senior high school years. In fact, I was so passionate about playing cricket that at one point I was even made the captain of my high school cricket team. But, when my parents noticed that my academic performance was getting poor, they suggested me (more like a “warning”) to play some other kinds of sports which could be played within a shorter period of time than cricket.\n\nBy the way, cricket usually takes about 8 to 9 hours of time finish a match if we play a limited over cricket, such as 50 overs match, but it could take even much longer if we play the test match. But, on the other hands, playing a soccer match would take only about 90 minutes or so. Therefore, I started to play football with my friends at school.\n\nInitially, I was playing only a few times a month, but now, I play it at least a few times a week. Anyway, football is all about scoring goals, and that is to send the “ball” inside the goalpost of the opponent team.  In a professional soccer match, which is played between two teams, consisting of 11 players each, whichever team scores more goals, they win.\n\nWell, soccer is my favourite sport now for me, primarily because the speed, at which this sport is played, thrills me and excite me like nothing else in this world. It is my favourite sport also because of its unpredictable nature. After all, the winner is not decided in this sport until the very last moment."

    "Answer": "Sports is one of my loves in my life. I like almost all major sports and can play football, cricket and badminton very well. Among all these sports that I often enjoy on TV or play with my friends, \"football\" is my favourite one.\n\nI have been playing football since childhood, but I am not a professional footballer. I have almost made it a hobby. In my school age, I used to play football three days a week, but these days, I have entered into professional life and can not play it as often as I would like. I do follow almost all major European football leagues such as EPL, La Liga and Bundesliga. The Bayern Munich from German Bundesliga is my all-time favourite among the EU football clubs. Among the national teams, Germany is my favourite team and the German striker Marco Reus is my favourite footballer.  \n\nFootball as a sport is very famous all over the world. To play football, we need a large green playground with two goalposts on opposite sides. The rules are very simple but everyone has to abide by the rules. The number of players needed for this game is twenty-two and they are divided into two teams. Each team has eleven players, and among them, one is the goalkeeper who safeguards the goalposts. There is a centre where the play starts with the whistle blow sound of the referee. The referee has the power to comment on right or wrong and dictate the games. Two other referees help the main referee from the sideline of the ground. The players have to maintain the rules constantly and if any player violates them, he or she is shown a red card which means he/she can no longer continue to play. The main objective of each team is to score as many goals as possible. The team with the higher number of goals wins the match.\n\nFootball was invented in England and is one of the hugely popular sports all around the world. It has spread almost every nook and corner of the world and is enjoyed by millions of fans. I am passionate about this sport so much and it can give me a thrilling experience in and off the field. It's in my blood and I love it so much - be it watching a football competition or playing with my friends."

    "Answer": "Cricket is my favourite sport and I love to play it more than any other sport. I used to play it every day in my childhood and adolescent period but nowadays I play this sport once in a week, mostly on my days off. However, I often watch international cricket tournaments on TV and never miss the event when my country plays cricket in an international tournament.\n\nThere are basically three different formats of this sport which are widely popular. They are ‘test matches’ one day cricket’ and ‘T20’. The rules of the game slightly change based on the format of the cricket. One day cricket tournament is the most popular format and two teams, each with eleven cricket players, fight each other to win the match. The captain who wins the toss decides either to bat or bowl first. Each team play for 50 overs, each over consists of six bowls, and the team that bats first sets a run target for the opponent. If the first team can restrict the second team not to collect as many runs as they have scored, then the first team will win the match. On the contrary, if the second team can cross the run their opposite team has accumulated, they will be declared as the winner. A tie is very unlikely, though not impossible! When two teams’ scores stand as exactly the same, it is a tie. Two umpires in the field and another one in front of computer devices monitor the game and decide the rules. The test format and T20 have their own sets of rules but the fundamentals remain almost the same –score runs and restrict the opponent from reaching this run, or accumulate more runs than the opponent has collected.\n\nI have started playing cricket from a very early stage of my life. I have practised a lot and I had been a member of our local cricket team. I would say I am an all-rounder in cricket and I love to score runs. This is the most popular sport in our country and I have an acute enthusiasm for playing and watching this sport. This sport requires fitness, practice, use of techniques, muscle-power, strategy, teamwork, and inherent abilities which are quite exciting to have in a single game. The thrill and excitement the sports offers are the main reason I like this sport. In fact, most of the people in my country would say that cricket is their favourite sport. We play cricket at the international level and that makes this sport very popular among our countrymen."

    "Answer": "I love to take part in outdoor sports and football is my favourite one. In fact, it helps me to get entertained and at the same time, I remain healthy. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about my favourite sports.\n \nFootball is a popular form of sport. Besides, this is a great way to develop good health and mental stability. When the players take part in the sport, they are to run after the ball for a certain period of time. Thus, they have their physical exercise and at the same time enjoy the game. It also helps to increase focus on any issues and the most important issue is that it builds the capacity to play in a team. Actually, without teamwork, it is not possible to win a football match. Further, a football game is also a great source of entertainment for the spectators. They also derive much pleasure in watching the games.\n\nBefore joining the college, I had plenty of leisure hours to spend with football. But now due to my academic pressure, I hardly can manage times for practising and participating in matches. Now I play once or twice in a week based on my leisure. I used to join the practice matches every day in the local club. But now I am unable to practice once in a week. If there are any matches available, I practice on that day only. As a result, my performance is decreasing gradually. But if I get a chance, I usually do not miss the football matches on television. Most of the times the matches are held at night and I watch them before going to bed. This is the most impressive sport I have ever experienced, I think.    \n\nPlaying football is easy. It requires two teams of players and each of the team will consist of 11 players. Besides, there are some specific positions in the team. Not everyone is allowed to play with the ball always. The team division helps to decide priority with the ball. Some of the players are to attack with the ball while there are some other players to prevent the attack from the opposition attackers. Besides, there are two goalkeepers who try to prevent football to enter the net. The game runs for 90 minutes and there is a break after 45 minutes. All the players take the break to energise themselves. The team which can score more goals becomes the winner.  \n\nThis is my favourite sport for some reasons. First of all, it is able to remove tiredness from the body and helps to concentrate on a specific issue. Besides, football players are able to endure a huge amount of physical labour. They are to run for over one hour and thus they become flexible with physical labour. Further, I like the sport as this is a great one that helps to reduce stress. On the other side, it improves cardiovascular functions and bone strengths. If someone wants to reduce body fat, this is a great source for them. Continuous running helps to burn unwanted fat from the body. Another important aspect of the sport is it helps to enhance the confidence level. This game requires fewer costs. Considering all the issues, I like this game very much."

    "Answer": "To tell the truth, I have taken many pictures in my life, both randomly as well as on special occasions, but none of those pictures really stands out as great as the one which I took about 30 years ago as a young kid at a lake. Let me explain to you what exactly happened on that eventful day.\n\nAs a young kid, I just loved to watch my uncle fishing. In fact, I was so crazy about watching fishing that I could hardly sleep the night before my uncle used to go fishing. It was quite an excitement. My uncle also wouldn’t mind such crazy excitement of mine unless, of course, he was travelling a bit more faraway than usual in order to do fishing. But, on that day, even though, my uncle needed to travel more than the usual distance, I insisted really hard that I would also go with him since I came to know (from a very “reliable” source”) that the lake, where my uncle was going to do his fishing, had lots of big fishes.\n\nAnyway, eventually, my uncle gave up his idea of leaving me at home and decided to take me with him instead. So naturally, my excitement knew no bounds because I was very much hoping that we were going to catch some really big fish on that day, and I was proved right. In fact, seeing me wrestling with those big fishes, caught by my uncle on that day, my uncle felt so happy that he actually decided to take a picture of me with them. I am sure that my uncle took that picture because, just like me, he also was enjoying that rare happy moment of his only nephew.\n\nAnyway, I like this particular photograph because it managed to capture the real “happy and wild” me in a very natural manner. I like this particular picture also because it incidentally was the first picture which was gifted to me by my loving parents in a very nice looking frame."

    "Answer": "I have never been a professional photographer and yet I have a great passion for photography. I know very little about the technical aspects of the camera and to be honest, I take photos of my own preference rather than maintaining aspects a professional photographer would do. The websites like Flickr, Instagram and Pinterest have made it possible to store photos easily and I upload pictures I take mostly in Flickr.\n\nNow getting back to ‘a photograph I have taken and I really like’- is a tough call for me. In fact, there are so many of them. For this topic, I will pick a photograph that I took 4 years ago which portrays the serene nature of the rural life and ingenuine smile of a mother who was looking at her 2 years old daughter. I submitted this photo in a competition organised by a magazine and surprisingly it won the second prize.\n\nIt was 2012; probably mid-August and I went to one of my friends’ hometown with four other friends. This was actually a semester break and we wanted to enjoy our vacation in a remote and beautiful location. We stayed there for about 5 days and we had a great experience in this beautiful place. I had my camera with me and whenever I found something worth capturing, I took the photo. The photograph I am talking about shows green paddy fields and a clear blue sky in the background. The main subject of the photograph was a young mother who was looking at her daughter and was smiling. Among other things, a flying eagle, two other women and a large green tree were visible in the photograph.\n\nWhen I took the photo, I knew that it was going to be a great scene and moment to capture in a frame. When I saw the digital version of this photo, I simply loved it. This particular photograph got a lot of positive reviews and comments just within few days I uploaded it to Flickr. I loved the theme of this photo and it was one of the best shots I have ever taken. After it won the second prize, I knew that it is a worth praising photograph and one of the best I have ever taken. In fact, positive reviews, appreciating the feedback, my memory relating this photograph, and its nomination for an important contest make it one of the best photographs ever taken by me."

    "Answer": "Neither I am not a professional photographer, nor I do have any professional-grade camera, but often I try to capture moments. Most of the times they are self-portraits better known as 'selfie'. I am really glad to have a chance to talk about the issue and I thank you for this cue card topic.\n \nThe picture was taken by my smartphone a few years ago. In fact, the trend of selfie just began at that moment. I was standing on my rooftop. Suddenly the idea crossed my mind that why not I am taking a selfie. Accordingly, I took the selfie on the roof. The selfie shows that I am standing alone on the roof with a nice smile. My hairs were on the fly with the breeze. The sun was setting behind me. Besides, there was a piece of burning cigarette stick on my lips. Overall it was the environment that made the photo look beautiful.    \n\nI took the photo in the evening. It was almost dusk. The sun was going down. Since I live in a high-rise building, I am able to see the skyline of Shanghai. Often I enjoy the sunset scenes. Though the sunset view is not too much clearer, it is quite enough to entertain me. moreover, the entire environment was sunny on that day and the sky was deep blue. It was a perfect day and environment for a photoshoot under the open sky. But I had to remain satisfied with a couple of selfies as there were none to help me.\n\nUsually, I spend around half an hour on the roof in the evening to pass my time. In fact, it has become a routine for me to pass the evening hours on the roof. This is the time when nobody is present there and I can enjoy the loneliness. But often I meet with some kids playing there. On that day, I was all alone. All of a sudden, I decided to take a selfie. I never took photos before on this rooftop and this was the very first time for me. So, without any prior planning or thoughts, I took the photo. I had no troubles at all as this was a selfie.\n\nPresently, a large number of people use the selfie to capture their images either individually or in a team. Besides, they also use some sort of selfie sticks to capture the image from a higher level. But this was a candid selfie for me. Of course, I have taken so many pictures in my life but I entered into a different level after having my smartphone. Earlier, I used to pose before the camera of others and now I pose in front of my own camera. It has a strong lens comes with some special features. As a result, the pictures are clear and looks nice. The front camera comes with a 5-megapixel capacity. So, when it is about the selfie, there are no issues about low resolution or similar other matters. I like this photo much for some reasons. Firstly, this was my first selfie on the rooftop with my brand new cell phone. Moreover, I enjoyed the moments. Hence, the selfie was the perfect fit for me right then. So, I like this selfie particularly."

    "Answer": "Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, has a number of landmarks which bear the culture and history of my country in some significant ways. Today, I would like to talk about one such landmark which I have known as my own neighbourhood from my childhood.\n\nThis famous landmark is called “Ahsan Manzil” (meaning “the palace of Ahsan”, whereby “Ahsan” was the name of a very famous landlord’s son). Situated on the bank of the river “Buriganga”, this place is also passionately called the “palace on the river” by many people in my country.\n\nBuilt in and around the 1860s, this famous “pink palace” (pink is called because of its beautiful pink colour), was also the official residential palace of the “Nawab” (a native governor during the time of Mughal empire of India) and had remained so up and until the partition of India in 1947.  Anyway, now it has been established as a museum, and people have the opportunity to visit it to see many objects of historical and archaeological importance. It has 23 galleries displaying portraits, furniture and other objects used by the Nawabs.\n\nTalking about its looks and design, Ahsan Manzil is predominantly European in its architectural expression, even though the building's recessed verandahs may visibly remind the Mughal treatment of such buildings in a tropical climate. Its triple-arched portal, temple facade capped by a pediment, Greco-Roman column capitals, pilasters, and arched windows—all suggest that it is ostensibly a European-style building, albeit meshed with some decorative Indian motifs.  Established on a raised platform of 1 metre, the two-storied palace measures 125.4m by 28.75m. The height of the ground floor is 5 metres and that of the first floor is about 5.8 metres.\n\nAnyway, it is an important landmark, primarily because it still remains as one of the finest examples of Indo-European architecture in Bangladesh. Besides, it has witnessed many historical events of Bangladesh, starting from the last part of the 19th century to the initial years of Pakistan, as many historical and political meetings were actually conducted in this very palace."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this wonderful topic. I would like to talk about the ‘City Museum’ which is located in the western part of the city I live in and which is one of the most popular buildings in our town.\n\nThis building once was the city hall and was built in 1756 by the Portuguese. Some renovation works have been done on this museum but the original design of it was not changed. The city museum still gives an impression of fine architecture of the past and attracts so many tourists each day. People like to look at it and praise the design of this building. The interior of it is full of historical evidence of our past and a museum visitor is bound to love his tour in this museum for the reach experience it offers to everybody. This building is located near a park and the central library which is well known among the local people. As I said, it is more than 250 years old and in fact, one of the most visited and the oldest building in our city.\n\nThis building is a very important architectural proof of mid-Eighteen century. It looks like a castle from far away while it gives the impression of a gigantic temple when it is looked very closely. This red coloured building was turned into a museum in 1920 and all the history lovers around the world visit it for the local history and other important objects it holds.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a quite important building in our city. First, it represents our past and it signifies our present also. All the important historical and cultural objects and proofs have been stored there. Besides, this is one of the most popular tourist spots in our city that not only earns a huge sum of money but also introduces our local culture to visiting tourists. To elucidate the importance of this building I can mention that this building reflects our pride and the government spends a large amount of money each year to maintain its originality. In my childhood, I lived in an urban area and I read about this building in my textbook probably in grade three or four."

    "Answer": "Brazil is the country enriched with a notable number of landscapes and the Christ the Redeemer is one of the most important ones. In fact, this has become a landmark for the country. Now I will describe the statue briefly here, and thank you for letting me talk on this topic.  \n\nThis is a statue of Christ in the form of a saviour of the world. The statue is located in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It is located on the top of a hill and thus it looks larger and traceable from a long distance. It is said that the locals of the place where the statue is located now were disobeying to religion. A sense of Godlessness spread everywhere. Hence, to bring a sense of religion among the people, the decision was taken to install a statue. After lots of research and analysis, the decision was taken to make the statue of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe suggestions to place a Christian monument in Corcovado came in the 1850s. Initial planning was also done at that time. But owing some troubles, it was not established. Later, another attempt was made in 1920 to establish such a statue. Accordingly, activities to form the statue was launched. In 1922, the statue development began and it took nine years to complete the entire statue. It was completed in 1931. The cost to build this gigantic structure was huge (around 250,000 USD). Now, this is over 85 years old but still standing in perfect shape. Donations to build the structure was collected from the local Catholics of Rio.    \n\nThis is a very well-planned statue in the country. It weighs about 635 metric tonnes. The statue is situated on the top of the Corcovado mountain which is also in the Tijuca Forest National Park. The park overlooks the Rio city. This statue is the symbol of Christianity in the area. Before the establishment of the statue, most of the people had no respect for God. And to remind them of God, the statue played an interesting role. Now, this has become a cultural icon for the locality as well. In 2007. The statue was listed as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It has a magnificent look. The statue shows Jesus Christ is spreading his hands. The hands resemble the call for peace and prosperity.\n\nTo be frank, the statue is a pride for us and all Brazilians. The entire structure has been made of reinforced concrete for its durability. It underwent a restoration in the 1990s with some private and public initiatives as some of its parts were damaged, cracked and attacked with fungi to a great extent with the passage of time. Hence, the statue experienced some renovations like the inclusion of walkways and escalators, access to the platform of the statue, new lighting fixture etc. the statue is now an important part of the country and often it is used as a symbol for our land. Now, the 30-meter long statue is the symbol of peace across the world."

    "Answer": "There are many newspapers and magazines in my country, Malaysia, which carry the news and information on all sorts of issues, both from home and abroad. While I try to read most of them from time to time, my favourite newspaper is the daily New Straight Times.\n\nThe daily New Straight Times is an English-language newspaper published in Malaysia. It is Malaysia's oldest newspaper, which still is in print, having been founded first as The Straits Times in 1845, and then, later on, was reestablished as the New Straits Times in 1974. The paper served as Malaysia's only broadsheet format (a large piece of paper printed with information on one side only) English language newspaper.\n\nWith a circulation of about 31000 (daily) and 86000 (daily E-paper), this newspaper undoubtedly is one of the most popular English daily newspaper which is read by all kinds of people from all walks of life. Anyway, initially, when I still was a young college going student, this paper-based newspaper was delivered to our home. But, soon after, with the introduction of computer and internet technology, I started to read this newspaper only on the world wide web since it is more convenient in that way because of the features like social media sharing, adjustable font size, media gallery, the search function for previous articles, videos and photos, as well as offline reading.\n\nAnother good thing about this newspaper is that it costs only about $1.10 per copy on the weekdays while $1.20 on the weekends. By the way, I read this newspaper at least once a day online, but I do browse it more than once or twice occasionally to get updates on some important news or incidents.\n\nAnyway, this is my favourite newspaper, primarily because it is Malaysia's leading authoritative news source which brings exclusive, comprehensive and in-depth news reporting in an objective manner. I like to read this newspaper because it always tries to keep its news updated online. Finally, it always puts authentic videos to offer more credence to their news."

    "Answer": "PCWorld computer magazine is one of my most preferred magazines. The magazine deals with the latest technology issues and I love it most for its stylish presentation of the trendy matters.  \n\nThis is a global computer magazine and available in almost all parts of the world. Here, in Australia, this is also available. Before 2013, the magazine was available in printed forms but now only the online publication is meeting the readers’ demands. The magazine has gained a huge reputation as it comes with the potential solutions, reviews of hardware and software and much more. Further, the magazine also contains the details of other technical issues and devices. People also can have reviews about television brands, cameras, phones and tablets etc. in this magazine. The magazine had experienced some rainy days before 2012 and there were some changes in the editorial level.    \n\nWhen the magazine was in printed form, I used to be a monthly subscriber and it cost me around 6 AUD then. But now the online subscription costs less than the former charge. It costs around 2.50 AUD now for the online version of the magazine. Though the magazine is headquartered in San Francisco, it is running its business across the world effectively. Besides, there are fewer changes in online magazines and almost all the reviews and articles are the same. The magazine is also available under different other names in different countries but the popularities are skyrocketing in the present days for its online presence. The first magazine was published in 1983 and since then it is being continued. But the magazine also underwent some controversies but instead of ditching, readers have grabbed it more firmly.   \n\nI read the magazine whenever I can manage time. Since I am a monthly subscriber, I get the online copy in my email. Downloading the copy, I read it on my iPad. Mostly, I read the magazine in my leisure times. But if I need to know about any specific issue, or if I need to read any review over technology, I browse the magazine and read it. In fact, there are no specific time frame or limits for me to read the magazine. I carry my iPad with me and the magazine is stored in that. Sometimes, I share relevant information with others if I feel necessary. Moreover, the magazine contains all the latest technological reviews over electronic gadgets. When I decide to buy any specific electronic gadget, I try to get a review from my surrounding and if they are unable to provide me with the right directives, I look that matter into this magazine. So, it appears that this is the magazine that is able to help me around the day.     \n\nCertainly, there are a good number of reasons to like this magazine. First and the most important thing about the magazine is that it is all about technology. In fact, technology changes every now and then. So, if someone wants to keep pace with the advanced ages, they need to read this magazine. The magazine comes with the latest news about technological issues. If you are unaware of the matters, it may happen that you are lagging behind in your real-life issues. To me, it is the key to enter into the kingdom of information technology. Hence, I like it most than any other magazines."

    "Answer": "I am not really too particular about my dress up or the clothing item I choose to wear. So, I try to buy any kind of clothing items as long as they look good. But unfortunately, this “look good” thing didn’t exactly work for me when I bought a full sleeve shirt.\n\nYes, as you may have rightly guessed that I didn’t like that full sleeve shirt which I bought about a year ago from a local market. The shirt seemingly looked nice with its light grey colour, matching buttons and a couple of nicely designed chest pockets. It also fit me real nicely with its perfect waist length. Made with linen-cotton fabrics, I thought that the shirt was a perfect bargain for me since it was sold to me at a much lower price.\n\nBy the way, I purchased that shirt from a local market, mainly because I wanted to help out a relative of one of my friends who had opened a new clothing store there. But, up and until that point, I have never really bought anything from that market because, to tell the truth, I thought that most of the clothing items there were of poor quality.\n\nI should also mention here that the shirt wasn’t made by any of the famous clothing brands of my country, but I still bought it because I thought that every clothing company, famous or not, should be a fair chance to prove their worth to their customers. After buying that shirt, I even used it for a couple of weeks randomly without any trouble. But after that, I stopped wearing that shirt, apparently because I didn’t like it anymore.\n\nAnyway, I didn’t like the shirt anymore, mainly because its colour seemed to have faded away a bit too soon for my liking, and that too only after a couple of regular detergent wash. I didn’t like it also because it wouldn’t remain polished and smooth even after ironing it for a long time."

    "Answer": "Well, that’s an interesting topic to talk about. A few months ago I purchased a tie that I’ve never used and did not like it just after I brought it home. I bought this tie from a street market near the city shopping mall and it cost me around 7 dollars. In my office, we are allowed to wear casual dresses on Thursday. However, we are required to wear complete formal dresses on Monday and Tuesday and tie is mandatory on these two days in office. I purchased the tie specifically to use it in my office.\n\nIt was a blue colour tie with vertical white stripes all over it. I have had three ties and none of them had any stripes on it. I thought the striped tie would add some variations to my tie collection but unfortunately, I did not like it at all. Surprisingly I liked it when I picked it from the shop but as soon as I tried it at home, my disliking grew for it.\n\nSince I bought it from a street market, I did not have the chance to try it before purchasing. I chose it as it was and after I wore it at home, I found that it was shorter in length than usual. The making of the tie was poor and the stripes did not match me at all. After that, I thought to return it but it was quite impossible as the street market sellers often change their locations. Honestly speaking, I liked the colour and style of this tie but the poor making ruined it all.\n\nI still have this tie at home and I have no intention of wearing it ever again. This purchasing experience taught me a valuable lesson – never purchase an item of clothing too hastily and without actually trialling it first. I will perhaps never buy a tie from a street market."

    "Answer": "Recently my trip to Singapore was a great one and I had the chance to shop in the traditional street markets of the country. I bought a pair of jeans pant from a market there but that appears a bit faulty now.\n\nIn fact, I went to Singapore with my family to pass the Christmas vacation and meet some other relatives living in the country. To celebrate Christmas, my dad took me to the street markets and bought me a couple of clothing at a moderate price. But before the purchase, he told me to check the item I am to buy as often the items appear faulty. He was right. I found a small hole in both of the pants and they are in the hip pocket. It seems that the holes have been made by any insect cut. When I wear them, they look really unpleasant and brings a sense of discomfort to me.\n\nSingapore is a popular tourist destination in Asia. Besides, some of my intimate relatives are there. In fact, my dad migrated to the USA from Singapore while my grandparents are still living there. So, whenever we have any vacation, we move to Singapore and we do not miss the events like Christmas. We moved to Singapore on December 23 and my dad took me shopping on the next day. He prefers the street markets as those are the place where one can have the best things. But you are to select the pieces carefully as the sellers often try to deceive the customers about the price. From the Chinatown Street Market, I bought the pair of jeans pant. The seller asked for a higher price than the usual one but after a lot of bargain, he agreed to sell the pants after my price.\n\nI liked the pants as they were different in colour and style. The jeans pants were the combination of dark blue with a light shade of grey. So, they looked different. Besides, they were skinny. So, I thought they would suit me best. Further, they attracted my attention while they were on display. The sewing, the fabric etc. were fine. So, I decided to buy the pair. But my dad asked me to check for something else. But I argued with him and replied that I liked the colour and style of the pants. Usually, most of the jeans pants come with a zipper but this was a bit different. Instead of a zipper, it had bottoms which I have never used before.\n\nI was so excited that I forgot the advice from my father to check the pants carefully. After returning home, I discovered the holes in the pockets. But now I had nothing to do. The seller would not refund the price and actually, they do not have such refund policies as well. Moreover, the waist size did not match with me. My waistline is 27 inches while the pants come with the waist size 29. They were larger than me and I do not use belts with my pants. So, it was hard for me to adjust to the jeans pants. Hence, I started feeling irritated with the pants. Finally, I had to donate the pants to a charity fund which collected clothing for poor people. Indeed it was a bad buy for me this time."

    "Answer": "Learning new skills can always be helpful in order to become a successful person in life.  I have also learned a few skills in my life already, and today I would like to talk about one of them here.\n\nThe skill, I am talking about, is a motorcycle driving skill.  Ironically enough though, during my childhood, I was rather afraid of riding a motorcycle, let alone driving it. And the reason, for which, I was afraid of riding a motorcycle was that I just didn’t like its loud noise at the time of its start. But, of course, things got a little interesting for me when my uncle bought a battery-operated motorcycle about 12 years ago.  \n\nBy the way, I had no idea that there was some kind of battery operated motorcycle up and until that point. I became even more surprised when I found out that the battery-operated motorcycle didn’t make any sound. Needless to say, when I found out about such a unique piece of information about a battery-operated motorcycle, I became really interested in it. At some point, I even started to dream about driving it except, of course, I just didn’t know how to drive a motorcycle.\n\nSo, I asked my uncle to teach me how to drive a motorcycle, and he gladly accepted me as an apprentice. Initially, I was way too nervous about driving it, but my uncle was just too smart and skilful to teach me how to ride a motorbike within a week. And as soon as I learned to drive it, I started to take that motorbike to all kinds of places, including the markets, my friends’ places and my university.\n\nAnyway, I think that this skill is really useful, mainly because it allows me the freedom and the peace of mind of moving to all kinds of places at will. It is a useful skill also because it saves me a lot of time by taking me to places way faster than using other kinds of larger vehicles or transports."

    "Answer": "I can speak Spanish and I consider it as a very useful skill. My mother tongue is not Spanish and it was not even my second language in our school. However, I learned it during my three-year stay with my grandmother in Spain. My grandmother got me admitted to a local school and I learned this language there. After I returned to Italy, my homeland, I always practice Spanish with some of my friends from Spain. The comprehensive online language learning materials and reference websites also helped me learn this language.\n\nWell, I use Spanish to talk to my grandparents and three cousins I have in Spain. I also read Spanish storybooks and novels recommended one of my university teachers who is from Spain. Most importantly, I use my skill to translate some of the web page contents as a freelance translator and this brings a good income for me. I have left the part-time job I was doing in a large grocery shop and now I work solely on the translation jobs online.\n\nI believe that learning a new language and actually being able to use it is a great skill. It enables us to know about a different culture and thus enhances our overall understanding of the diverse cultural aspects of various nations throughout the world. My skill in the Spanish language enables me to make new friends, read books written in another language and understand a different nation and their cultural aspects. Another important use of this skill is my freelancing job. I work as a translator from and to Italian, English and Spanish and I enjoy this job while I earn some money per month. In short, I would say that this skill is quite helpful and handy to me."

    "Answer": "Everyone has some sort of skill or some sort of special expertise that they find very helpful. I have a skill of building and repairing electronic hardware. I learnt it at a vocational training course and I am very glad that I invested this time to learn this skill as I find it very handy in my practical life.\n \nBuilding electronic hardware is easier if you have the right know-how on the issue. Moreover, it requires extensive training to perform the act. Electronic devices mostly work on logic. It works on the condition of 0 or 1 basis. When the data is sent as 0, the device would be ineffective while when it is 1, the device starts working. This is the basic logic behind the electronic hardware development. If someone becomes skilled at the task, the development and repair of electronic devices become easier gradually.   \n\nI am a student in Delhi and last year got admitted at a vocational training institute. I was curious about electronic hardware from my early childhood. I also tried to repair them by unscrewing the devices but finally, that turned into a mess. Often I damaged electronic equipment at home. Accordingly, I decided to take a short training on the issue and the chance came when a local institute was enrolling new students for some of its affordable course. I enrolled in the electronic device and hardware development with the centre and took a six-month diploma. I learnt everything about the electronic devices – how they worked, how to build a new device or repair the old ones and more.\n\nI use the skill in different ways. Most of the commoners are unable to repair their electronic hardware. When they cannot repair them, they move for having newer electronic devices. I think this is a kind of waste of money. You do not need to buy a fresh piece of hardware which you can repair. So, I use my skill to help people by repairing electronic hardware for them. Sometimes I build some tailored hardware as well considering the needs of the people. In my locality, I am the best one in servicing the electronic gadgets and people seek my support in their day to day life.   \n\nThis is really useful skill. Before learning the skill, I was unable to repair the electronic hardware of my home. Rather I have damaged lots of electronic devices and equipment. After having extensive training on the matter, I developed the right sense of dealing with electronic hardware. Now I am capable of building and repairing almost all types of electronic hardware and other devices. The skill is useful for me at home and at the same time, I have opened a small shop to provide a professional service to the people who are in need. In fact, I am having a great response from the locals. Every day they are appearing with their troubles and I am repairing them as per the necessity. I have a plan to extend this idea of electronic hardware building and repairing and someday I might take it as a profession as well."

    "Answer": "Today’s news media are full of all kinds of news. But, today, I would like to go ahead and talk about one of those few news which, I thought, stood out among many others. The news was about a young boy from a poor family who was going to start his new job. I heard this news on one of the most popular news media outlets about a few months ago and watched it till the end since it was so intriguing.\n\nAnyway, again, the news was about a struggling boy from a poor family who was going to start his new job. But, unfortunately, the car, he was driving stopped only after driving about 10 or 15 minutes. Since he started his journey in the early hours of the morning (because his job was quite far away from where he lived), there was no car mechanic’s shop around either to have his car fixed. So, he started to walk on the road, when it was still dark in the morning. Seeing the young boy walking like that, a police car started to watch him carefully.\n\nThe news continued saying that the boy actually walked about 2 hours like that to arrive at his office while the police also had kept following him all the way. Later, the police asked the boy about his reason for walking for so long on that early morning. The boy gave him the reason, but the police actually couldn’t believe what he was hearing. So, police told the same story to the company boss, and the boss became so happy with the boy that he actually gave him one of his (the boss) most treasured and prize cars to drive. Needless to say, the news story taught us something really valuable about the work ethics and determination which we always take for granted.\n\nWell, I remember the news, mainly because it highlighted the determination of a young boy who valued his work so much. Besides, the news also highlighted the fact that such determination and hard work don’t always go unrewarded."

    "Answer": "This is a really nice topic and I would love to talk about a news story I read recently. In fact last month I read a news story in a magazine which was about the contributions of women scientists in human history. It was a fascinating and educative news story and the whole article was quite informative.\n\nI am not sure about the exact date but my best assumption is 10-14 May was the time when I read the news story in the magazine. The magazine that covered this news story is a monthly Science & Technology magazine called ‘Tech-World’.\n\nI thought this was a very intriguing news story and it was a good read. I found it quite informative and the way the writer presented the news-story was outstanding. This news story tells the readers about the life, work and contributions of Marie Curie, Rosalind Franklin, Rachel Carson, Ada Lovelace, Alice Wilson and many other famous scientists as well as about many little-known women scientists. I found it quite captivating as it covered an interesting topic. Though we know about some famous female scientists, contributions of other less-known female scientists towards the enhancement of science was not known to me.\n\nHonestly, I knew very little about women scientists and their invaluable researches and works for science, except, Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin. This news story presented how women in history have contributed towards the advancement of science and their sacrifices were remarkable and should never be forgotten. The topic itself was very enthralling and the way the story was presented was quite unique. I remember this news story possibly because of its interesting topic and outstanding description. I think such a news story should be more frequent in science magazines to educate its readers."

    "Answer": "While browsing Reuters, recently I encountered with news on banknotes in England which were being manufactured using animal fats. It appeared interesting to me.   \n\nIn fact, the headline of the news attracted me that read - New British banknotes fall foul of vegetarians. As many of the UK citizens are vegetarians, the opposed the idea. The Bank of England confirmed that they were using tallow, a type of animal fat, to manufacture the banknotes. The five-pound note contains the portrait of Winston Churchill, the Wartime Prime Minister for the country. A mixed reaction was found among the bank note users while some of them claimed that it may even instigate religious reactions as well. Besides, the Bank of England has made a strategic mistake by admitting the tallow issue, some opined.    \n\nUsually, I browse different news websites at night before going to bed. I am unable to manage time in the day to check the news. So, it has become a habit for me to browse the news channels and websites every day before going to bed. Habitually, I browsed the Reuters to know about the latest updates of the world. While browsing, the title attracted me and I entered into the link. I can remember the day clearly- it was around 10.30 pm on November 29, 2016, when I was browsing the website. I read the news and became shocked about the consequences.  \n\nCertainly, this was unacceptable news where the state is having an injustice to a majority of its citizens. Since the vegans avoid all types of animals from their menu, it is natural that they would deny using the five-pound banknotes in their everyday transactions. Besides, religiously the use of animal fat is sensitive to some of the people which may spark an unwanted protest and chaos in the country. Of course, this is a praiseworthy initiative by the government. The new banknote comes with some special security features and smarter in look. But the application of tallow in manufacturing is not acceptable at all. In fact, this is a kind of indirect threat to the vegans of the country, I think. If the government can use tallow, it can also do something more that may hit the vegan sentiment in future.\n\nAs a vegan, the news was shocking to me. Though I am not a resident of England, I can feel the sense of the vegans living there. This is really troublesome to adjust with the things you are not habituated with or wanted to get rid of your life. But the government is compelling the citizens to cope up with the changes that they want instead of the people’s demand. In fact, it appeared to me that the government is turning a bit rigid on some issues which are casting some detrimental impacts on the ordinary people. Luckily the state I am living in has not taken such decisions to remodel the currencies ignoring the public feelings. In fact, the news touched me emotionally than any other news on the website that I had read that night. So, I can still remember the entire issue clearly."

    "Answer": "I have a few friends who I consider to be interesting.  All of them are considered to be highly successful professionally except one. Here I would like to talk about that one friend of mine who can’t really be called a successful person, but I still consider him to be a bit more fascinating than the others.\n\nHis name is Seikh Farabi, and I have known him for more than 15 years to call him an interesting person. We grew up together in the same town for a significant part of the time before we parted from each other. Now he lives in another town which is about a couple of hundred kilometres away from my place, but we still keep in touch with each other over the phone.\n\nAnyway, Farabi is a man of little words, but when he talks, he does so with a certain type of conviction and authority which can be hard to ignore by any person who doesn’t know him well.  In other words, Farabi has an uncanny ability to convince any person to believe in something which the person would never otherwise believe. Farabi doesn’t really like to laugh either unless he has a very good reason to do so. But, if I remember correctly, Farabi wasn’t really like this when I first met him at a college parade, celebrating our independence day, about 10 years ago. Back then, he was a rather funny and talkative person. But, once he lost his father about 10 years ago, he became a completely changed person.\n\nBy the way, Farabi doesn’t really do anything for living since he is from a very wealthy family. Instead, all he does now is to write devotional poems and studying religion.\n\nAnyway, I consider this friend of mine so interesting, mainly because he likes to learn about things which regular people like us probably would never care about. I find him fascinating also because he knows exactly how to attract and hold the attention of other people by using a few words."

    "Answer": "Wow, this topic is tough!  Not because I don’t know anyone interesting enough, quite the opposite.  I think everyone is interesting if you take the time to get to know them.  It is so easy to make assumptions about people, and then when you come to talk to them you find out all sorts of unexpected and extraordinary things.  When I first joined my running club I thought all the other runners had always been amazing athletes and found running easy – not like me, I was lumbering around sweating as they sprung ahead gazelle-like!  Then once I got talking to them I found many had their own stories, turning their lives around after a setback such as illness, or obesity, everyone ran for a reason. To spend time with friends, to get time to reflect, to enjoy the outdoors; to improve their physical or mental health.  Every one of us is unique and interesting.  That’s just from my running club, if I think my wider social circle, the possibilities are endless!\n\nSo, who shall I choose?  I like people who can surprise you, who are curious about the world, don’t judge and are confident enough in themselves to pursue their own dreams in their own quiet way, wherever that may take them. OK, so I know who is all of those things!  I’ll tell you what sort of person they are, how we first met, what they do for a living and I think from all of that it will be very obvious why they are so interesting to me!\n\nSo, this person is one of the kindest, nicest people I’ve ever met.  I can tell you exactly when we first came across one another.  I had just relocated to Sheffield and didn’t know a soul.  One day I went for a walk from my house to the open countryside of the Peak District, and snow started to fall.  I ended up at a coffee shop on an alpaca farm, quite high up.  The snow was over a foot deep and still falling.  I went into the coffee shop and this man and his wife were there.  He was a farm manager, and she ran the coffee shop.  There was a roaring fire in the corner and they both made me welcome, we chatted and I dried out with a steaming hot chocolate before heading back home through the snow.  I’d been worried about relocating on my own to a strange city, but these people were so friendly, I felt at home, this move was going to be OK.\n\nSome months later, I started volunteering at the farm, and I got to know Fred, the farm manager really well.  I found out that he’d done loads of different things in his life.  He’d travelled the world fixing x-ray machines at airports; he’d worked as an engineer; his wife and he had had various businesses including trading in second-hand goods and antiques.  Now they’d taken on this rural coffee shop and he was managing a farm.  It seems there was nothing he couldn’t do!  He and his wife were incredibly friendly and social, both could instantly put anyone at their ease.  You know how some people can just talk to anyone?  Well, Fred is like that.  Animals and children instantly adore him.   Whatever he turns his hand to, he seems to do with natural ease.  He was just as happy dressing up as Father Christmas or supervising a ‘spit-off’ between alpacas.  That’s what you call it when you put a male and female together to see if the female is pregnant.  If she is, she will reject the male forcefully – hence ‘spit off’!  We spent hours and hours together on the farm, working in all weathers and doing extraordinary things.  Lugging water down to far fields when pipes were frozen; herding animals together to move them from one field to another, or simply playing with the goats, dogs or other animals that could be great fun to interact with.  He patiently taught me practical skills like driving the tractor, and how to inject the alpacas or trim their feet.  We laughed all the time.  I think from the outside we were probably unexpected friends, but we got on brilliantly from the start and even today can talk each other into the ground when we do meet up now and again for a coffee and catch up in town.\n\nFred is retired now, but still as busy as ever, he helps manage a pre-nursery school doing their books and administration, but also going in to help play with the kids when he can.  He also has a couple of energetic dogs to keep him up and about every day.  What makes him so interesting I think is his breadth of life experience.  He has seen and done so many things, yet he is unassuming and generous.  In all the years I’ve known him he’s never had a bad word to say about anyone – despite been given cause to do so.  He is generous with his time, always sees the best in other people and adoring of his wife.  They have been together for a very long time indeed, but still, always hold hands together when I see them together walking down the street.  He isn’t just an interesting character, he is an inspirational one too.  He has quietly ploughed his own path as the saying goes, and he is a loyal and wise friend too.  In an age when many people feel compelled to constantly remind you how impressive and interesting they are through Facebook, celebrity or even what they wear – he is a breath of fresh air.  He genuinely has compelling stories to tell and interesting insights to share, but only with those who bother to take the time to stop and ask.  Every street, every bus stop, every café probably has someone like him.  It is always worth a cautious smile and a shy ‘hello’ in a new place, you might encounter someone more interesting than you could possibly imagine if you just keep an open mind and take the time to ask questions and listen as well as talk!"

    "Answer": "Mr. Albert Jonathon is our physics teacher and he is perhaps a very interesting person I know about. As a person, he is a very talented and honest person. He is also a very good teacher, and a veteran of science. However, he is a living contradiction who believes in many superstitions even after being a man of science. I mostly like him because of his creative and effective teaching style and I find him interesting because of his personality and interesting activities.\n\nI first met Mr. Albert when he came to our class as a physics teacher. I was in my second semester then. He is basically a lecturer in our university and this is his main profession. Apart from that, he writes for a science magazine and also works there as a part-time consultant.\n\nThere are many aspects I find very interesting about him. First, the way he dresses is quite primitive and outdated. Someone mistakenly will think him as a clerk or as a jobless person instead of being a professor of a large university. Interestingly his preference for wrist-watches and shoes are quite exceptional and all of his watches and shoes are branded and must be very expensive. Again, as a physics teacher when he tells ghost stories, you won’t believe him. He is a gifted person with a quite remarkable way of teaching and inspiring others. I personally like his teaching style very much. Then his fascination with stamp and coins is also interesting. He has some hobbies which are popular among children and could hardly be seen among adults. Finally, he has a rich collection of books but he never lends any books to anyone. As an explanation, he once told us that people hardly return his books.\n\nEverything I know about this person is quite interesting to me. Thus he is probably the most interesting person I have ever known."

    "Answer": "I have met with Joseph, an Asian boy, at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia where I am having my undergraduate courses now. He is the guy who is different from others. He is quite interesting too.\n\nJoseph belongs to a converted family in India. His parents were not Christian at the beginning and later on converted to Christianism. Thereby, he is quite influenced by both religions and cultures. He is quite interesting in the sense that he does almost all the things in unusual ways. He prefers to avoid the traditional methods to perform acts. He never tells a lie or hits other. But if he is injured or insulted, he never takes revenge. This is the basic difference between him and the rest of us which appears very interesting to me.\n\nI cannot exactly recall the day when I meet him first. Might be it was the first week at university when I met him. He was a latecomer on the class and still, he is. It is an ordinary norm to apologise for the late but he did not. Rather entering into the class, he took his seat silently. Since he sat beside me, I asked him why did not seek apology for the late, with a smile he replied that he does not apologise for being late as it was not his mistake. The watchman did not allow him to enter the university compound as he failed to show the identity card. In fact, identity cards for the new students were issued after two weeks of the inauguration. This was the type he used to be and it was the first meet of mine with him. The friendship between us grew stronger gradually.\n\nJoseph has no relatives in Australia. So, he lives alone. But the expenses are huge. To meet his needs and expenses, he works at a coffee shop as a part-timer. With his ready wit and smart answers, he enchants the customers in the shop. So, all the regular customers love him much and he is well tipped. As a result, his earning is very well and leads a decent life. But it should be admitted that he is a hardworking individual. He works for six hours a day. He takes a break only for a half-day and that is only on the days when we have classes in the evening. He is planning to settle permanently in Australia and dreams of being a computer programmer in future.  \n\nHe is interesting. He is mind-blowing. There are numerous reasons to consider him special among us. He does all the tasks in different manners than they are usually done by others. He uses pencils to write on his exam scripts with the logic that a pencil makes mistake removal easier. Besides, he likes to talk on the old-fashioned land phone. He does not use cell phones for communication. So, often it is difficult to get him when he is most needed. Usually, he remains silent but once he starts talking, it becomes difficult to beat him in logics. I do not know how he manages to create all the logics. Only this ability has made him a bit different than all, I believe."

    "Answer": "I have watched many movies which are simply outstanding in its every true sense, but very few of them really has managed to stick to my mind like the Spaghetti Western movie called “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly”. By the way, Spaghetti Western is a subgenre of movies that were basically made in Italy but set in the 19th-century American West.\n\nRegarded as one of the all-time international box office successes, this legendary film was released in the year of 1966 by and created by an Italian film director called Sergio Leone. The plot in this movie mainly revolves around three gunslingers who are competing to find a fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amid the violent chaos of the American Civil War (specifically the New Mexico Campaign in 1862), while participating in many battles and duels along the way.  \n\nIn this movie, the first man (Clint Eastwood) can be seen as an ex-bounty hunter and a forgiving person knows the name of the cemetery in which the gold is buried, the second, who is a fast-tempered greedy man knows the name on the grave. But the third person, a cruel cold-blooded murderer, knows none. So he has to reach the gold in his own way of finding something.\n\nAnyway,  I watched this movie for the first time during my late high school years about 15 years ago at a movie theatre with a couple of my friends. But, little did I know back then that I would become so crazy about this movie that I would end up watching it dozens of time.\n\nAnyway, I would like to watch this movie again because it had brought one of my most favourite Hollywood stars called Clint Eastwood into stardom. I would watch it again also because this is one of the very few western masterpieces (if not the best western movie of all time) where the plot of the movie is extremely clever and always unpredictable for the whole three hours of its time."

This was an outstanding movie with a compelling storyline, set during World War II. I enjoyed this movie quite a lot and this was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I watched this movie on our DVD player with two of my friends. On a weekend I rented this movie and invited Patrick and Stephen to watch it at our home.\n\nThis movie tells the story of the invasion of Normandy in World War 2. It is considered an epic war drama film and it shows notable graphics and depiction of wars. This is indeed the kind of film that most of the viewers are bound to like. This film has got many positive criticisms and won many international awards.\n\nPersonally, I liked it so much because of its high-quality production, realistic portrayals of war, praiseworthy acting, notable casting and historic significance. I believe that this movie easily qualifies to be listed in someone’s all-time favourite movies and watching it again would not be less enjoyable by any means.\n\nPatrick and Stephen are both working full time- Patrick as a lawyer and Stephen as an investment banker. A few months back we hung out together and we agreed that we will enjoy a day off together just for the old time’s sake. We also agreed that we will spend our time at home just like we used to do in our high school days. Then I proposed to select a movie to watch and finally we decided to watch this movie again.\n\nPersonally, I am a fan of Steven Spielberg movies and ‘Saving Private Ryan’ is one of his best works. I am sure I will enjoy this movie again with my two close friends, as much as I did at a young age."

    "Answer": "I have watched a good number of movies but none of them was so splendid like the movie '12 Angry Men'. I believe this was one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life and I also would like to watch it again.  \n\nThe movie – 12 Angry Men is a noir thriller movie. The movie was produced in 1957 and gained much popularity for its brilliant plot and cast performance. The movie was about a trial where a slum boy was alleged to kill his father. There were 12 jurors who were assigned to run the trial and come to a verdict. But at a certain point, one of the jurymen was convinced that there was enough doubt to be sure that the boy actually killed the father. He was thus against condemning the boy of the murder. He started breaking down the allegations against the boy. In fact, none of the evidence was strong enough to prove the boy guilty. The Jurors were divided into two groups and after lots of hot words and logical exchanges, they come to the point that the boy was not guilty. Finally, all of the jurors voted the boy as ‘not guilty’.\n\nI watched the movie back in 2010 when I was travelling in Delhi. I went there for some business purposes and had to travel on the train for two days. So, to pass the time, I took some movies on my laptop. It was the first movie that was on the list. So, I watched it on the train. But watching the movie on a fast-moving train was not so easy. The train was vibrating at its extreme speed and in line with the shake, my laptop was unsteady. So, often I had to get a closer look at the screen. Besides, it was impossible to listen to the dialogues as the noise prevented the sounds from reaching out my ear perfectly. Luckily I had my mobile phone headphone with me that I used on the laptop.\n\nI was travelling with my team. We were four in number and reserved a first-class cabin on the train. But none of them was interested in watching the movie on the train. Rather they preferred playing cards. So, I had to watch the movie alone. It was a boon for me. Because of the external noise, I could not listen to the dialogues and in such case, if I had to share the headphone, I could not comfortably enjoy the movie. In fact, sharing a small-sized laptop is really challenging in ordinary situations, and if it is in a train compartment, the troubles increase.\n\nI would like to watch the movie again for some special reasons. Firstly, I could not completely enjoy the movie on a train. So, I have a curiosity to watch it again. Besides, the movie plot is very special and dramatic. Though this was a thriller movie, I think the dramatic elements are more. While watching, I also guessed that the slum boy was guilty of the charges pressed against him were almost true. But the allegations were turned down by the jury 8. He argued favouring the boy. Though he was criticised by the other jurors for backing the hapless boy, he did not give up. At last, he proved that the boy was not guilty. The event touched me severely. I think some sort of social messages has been delivered with the movie. So, I think I should watch the movie '12 Angry Men' again to have a better understanding."

    "Answer": "In this busy life of ours, we never really like to miss an opportunity to celebrate a little. Today, I would like to talk about one such opportunity which allowed me to celebrate the marriage anniversary of one of my dear uncles.\n\nIt was the 30th marriage anniversary of my uncle but it felt like the very first anniversary of them because there was just no shortage of passion, emotion and fun during the occasion. Of course, the 30th anniversary, which I attended a couple of years ago at my uncle’s place, was a bit different in a sense that my uncle and aunt didn’t really buy any gifts for each other since I, along with a few of my other cousins (both boys and girls), bought all kinds of gifts for them.\n\nBy the way, prior to that anniversary, my uncle didn’t only buy gifts for his love of life and vice versa, but also for each and every one of his nephews and nieces, because he really, really loves all of them. So, we all thought that it was the time for us to return the favour a little since we all were grown up by then and had our own money.\n\nAnyway, a few dozens of guests had attended the party, including us, our relatives and some of my uncle’s old friends as well as that of my aunt’s. At the anniversary, I wrote a song myself and played it with my age-old guitar (which my uncle had bought for me when I was a young high school student). Besides, a couple of my lady cousins had made huge anniversary cake along with many other delicious dishes for us to enjoy.\n\nWell, I enjoyed the anniversary a lot. After all, there were plenty of senses of humour to poke fun at each other. Besides, what was especially pleasing about that anniversary was that everybody there had many good things to say about my uncle and aunt which I didn’t know before that day."

    "Answer": "Isn’t it interesting, that thinking of an important occasion or event, the examples given for this cue card are ‘a wedding or celebration’ yet when I thought of the most recent ‘important occasion’ I have attended, it wasn’t really either of these…. I’ll try and explain. I’ll talk about when and where I attended this event, who else was there and what my role was. I don’t know if ‘enjoy’ is quite the right word to use to describe how I felt about going, but I will tell you why I was pleased to be present for it and why it was so important I was.\n\nSo the occasion was just last month. I had to go to the funeral of an elderly relative of mine, who early in the New Year had died at the age of ninety. The funeral was held about a five-hour drive away from where I live, so it was a long way to go to be there to say goodbye, but it was very important to me to be there. I was very close to her. We were relatives, but only very distant ones. I’d got to know her as an adult, and we had exchanged letters with each other on a regular basis for over 25 years – that’s a quarter of a century. Our letters covered a multitude of topics from politics to travel and work. She herself had lived a full and interesting life, travelling all over the world and publishing many eminent papers on a range of topics from scientific enquiry to classical art - but in her last few years was in great pain. The last time I saw her was to join her for a celebratory lunch for her ninetieth birthday. She was mentally strong, but physically frail, and it was clear she was treating this occasion as a farewell meal. It wasn’t a surprise to me that she died a few weeks later. Of course, I wanted to be at her funeral, it was really important to be there to ‘send her off’ with affection, and share memories of her life with others who knew her and cared for her too.\n\nThis relative had never married, and didn’t have children. Even so, there were many people there. She would have been really pleased to see friends and neighbours, as well as family members, join the goodbyes. She did have some nieces and nephews, as well as me, a cousin, who were all at her last birthday meal. Together we came up with memories of her to include in the Eulogy about her life that was read at the ceremony. I suggested a range of readings that I thought were appropriate to her interests in the natural world and enthusiasm for literature. The funeral itself was poignant of course, but it was also a joyful celebration and recognition of a full and unique life. She had lived life to the full as the saying goes, and frankly was ready to go at the end. Her passing will leave a huge gap in the world, but although it may sound strange the funeral was joyful too. My role was to contribute ideas for the Eulogy, but also to start the service with a reading. I chose one from The Tempest, one of Shakespeare’s plays. It is quite a famous extract, and is probably used at funerals a lot as it is quite appropriate. It starts ‘our revels now are ended’ and I think she would have appreciated it as she loved Shakespeare very much.\n\nI don’t think I’d use the word ‘enjoy’ as such for a funeral, as it doesn’t seem entirely fitting. However, I found the ceremony and the gathering for tea and sandwiches that followed it incredibly comforting. It was lovely to hear stories of this relative that I’d not heard before from other people, and share happy memories. Someone had even found some old black and white film of her playing on a beach with her father and siblings when she was just a toddler. The footage was hilarious! She and her two brothers are running unevenly along in the sand, their father is playing with them with real joy. But it was a different time, so even though it is a hot day at the seaside, he is wearing a three-piece suit with a tie, a hat and smoking a pipe! It was impossible not to laugh at the picture, and be pleased she had enjoyed that carefree day so many decades ago that we were seeing for the first time all these years later. I think she would have loved it!  It brought this cousin back to life as we recalled with affection the adventures she’d had, the legacy she’d leave and the influence she’d had on all of us. Her life did make a difference, and that is all any of us might wish for. I believe as long as you talk about people and remember them they are still with you in a way.\n\nAlthough perhaps you weren’t expecting me to choose to talk about a funeral as a celebratory event, I still think it is appropriate. This funeral was indeed a celebration of the most remarkable life, and I was certainly an important occasion. I think it is only apt that both she and her funeral should be remembered with affection and with a smile."

    "Answer": "Well, it was a birthday celebration of one of my cousins and I consider it as an important and memorable event as I met so many of my relatives in a single day and I had a really great time with them. This was a rare event for me and I enjoyed a lot.\n\nIt was three or four years ago and the birthday party was arranged in a large party hall in our hometown. My uncle and aunt decided to celebrate their son- John’s birthday, as they were scheduled to leave the country in a few months to permanently live in Australia. This was John’s 12th birthday and his parents invited more than 300 guests. The guest-list included mostly our relatives, John’s friends, my uncle’s colleagues, and some neighbours.\n\nThis was a special event and a happy celebration for me basically because of two reasons. I said goodbye and wished luck to John and my uncle and I had a chance to meet so many of my relatives in a single evening. This was quite exciting to see all my close relatives and their children. Just after I reached the party hall I noticed that some of my cousins were gossiping together. It was a long since I had seen many of them. They were also happy to see me and they called other cousins and we enjoyed our time together. We talk about each other, took photos together, exchanged our phone numbers and enjoyed our dinner. On this very occasion, I met some of my relatives after quite a long and meeting them in person was a very stirring experience for me.\n\nI also bought a gift for John, the birthday boy, and congratulated him. I also invited my uncle to visit us with his family before they leave the country. My younger sister Sara and my parents were very happy and excited about the whole event and I could tell they enjoyed the event very much. I must say this was a very rare occasion and the excitement and delight it brought for me was boundless."

    "Answer": "I must admit that I was more of a “complaining boy” as a high school student. In fact, I used to complain about many things which looked and sound perfectly normal. Oh, one more thing, I also used to complain about Geography subject.\n\nYes, back in my high school years, geography was one of the most boring subjects to me. In fact, it was so boring to me that I actually used to fall asleep in the class from time to time. I was scolded a lot by my geography teacher of because this insolent behaviour of mine in his class, but he also probably understood the sad and frustrating fact that I wasn’t the one to change, and, to my credit, I didn’t.\n\nAt some point, my good geography teacher even formally sent a note of complaint to my parents, but that wasn’t enough to change me either. However, in spite of all that, I was lucky that my geography teacher didn’t fail me in his subject, so I guess I owe him a very big “thank you” for that.\n\nSo, why I didn’t really like that subject in high school? Well, I guess that back then, I wasn’t just convinced that geography was actually of any practical use in life. In other words, I just didn’t think that memorizing the names of some countries, states and their locations was really necessary to become a successful person in life. On top of that, I don’t think that I had enough time to understand the difficult subject because of other classes and homework.\n\nInterestingly enough though, I actually have a great deal of interest in this subject now, mainly because now I am way more aware of this planet of ours, and how not only the natural catastrophes, like earthquakes and floods, but also the man-made events are affecting our part of the world. It interests me now also because we are commercially and culturally are more interconnected than ever with the rest of the world."

    "Answer": "Accounting is the subject that I find very interesting these days though I did not like it when I had to study it at my university level. I have finished my graduation in Computer Science major and we had Accounting part 1 and part 2 in our second year; 5th and 6th semesters. Thought Accounting was an important subject for us, I had very little interest in it. This was probably because of my misconception that it is only important for Commerce and Business Studies students. I studied accounting subject only to pass my course and also missed a few classes. Thus I failed to enter into the interesting world of accounting and that’s why disliked this subject.\n\nScience had always been major and I was never introduced to the accounting subject in my pre-university level. The teacher who took our accounting classes did not introduce us to the basic concept of accounting. Moreover, he went through chapters so quickly that I missed it completely. As a result, when the teacher explained the advanced concepts of accounting, I was completely lost. For all these reasons I was weak in accounting and this formed the disliking in me until the very recent time.\n\nWell, the reason I like accounting these days is quite interesting. After I started working as a Software Engineer in a multinational company, I worked on various projects. A year ago I was assigned to a project that required me to develop accounting software for an Australian company. Ironically I had to study many accounting books and tutorials to understand how I should implement the concepts and calculation in this software. I also attended a few training sessions organised by our office related to accounting and banking concepts. Once I understood the basic and interesting part of this subject, I actually started enjoying it a lot. The project took around 8 months to be delivered to the client and I was kind of forced to study and discuss a lot of accounting concepts during this period. Once I started understanding the fundamental concepts and its application in the real world, this subject became one of my favourite subjects."

    "Answer": "When I was a teenager, I had no interest in History. Consequently, the subject – history appeared boring to me. But now my views on the subject has completely changed.\n\nI had an idea that History mostly deals with dead people. I was correct in some senses. But I lacked the knowledge the history also dealt with time. In fact, history is the science of time and people. Now I believe that it is interesting than any other subjects. Unluckily, the days are gone. I repent of bunking classes and cutting some sorry figures in History. I did not like the idea of memorising the historical events of the USA.  Passing the subject with a smart grade was a kind of dream to me. Always I received poor marks on this subject because I was unable to focus on the written texts and tried to avoid the subject as much as possible for me.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I got familiar with the subject – history of the USA and continued till my high school grades. I extensively avoided the subject in these years because they appeared difficult to me. In each of the grades, a fresh history book was prescribed with the curriculum. Basically, it was done to make the students familiar with the national history so that they could be informed about the real stories of national heroes, independence and other national issues. But mostly, I did not go through the prescribed books. Hence, it became difficult for me to pass the subject in the exams. It was kind of annoyance to me to attend the classes. I was relieved of the trouble when I entered university.\n\nI cannot explain the causes behind feeling a strong sense of dislike with this subject. It is natural that all the students will not be skilled in each of the subjects. They might be stronger in some specific subjects and will have an average skill with the remaining ones. I was skilled in Mathematics and always had the highest score during my entire school tenure. But I was troubled with history. I think memorising the years and events related to the years were the most concerning issue for me. I was unable to memorise (and still I am) texts and pour them down into the exam scripts. Besides, with due respect, the teachers were unable to make the lessons interesting. For all such reasons, I developed a feeling of enmity with this specific subject. During the exam, my answer scripts were filled with some ‘fresh’ histories of my own imagination.\n\nIn recent years, I have gained the best experiences of my life. I travelled to several countries for my business, learnt about their respective histories and cultures. I compared the histories with my state and then suddenly comprehended that I almost have no idea about history of the USA. It made me shocked. I made the greatest mistake of my life - ignoring History in school days. Now the subject appears interesting to me. I am a grown-up male bearing no irritations with history. Luckily, I have some history books in my personal collection and have started reading them to know about the history of my land. The events I read now provide pleasure to me, truthfully, reading books on USA history is now my favourite pastime."

    "Answer": "We have a tradition in our extended family which encourages us to enjoy any kind of events together whether we are doing the outdoors or just doing it at home. So, thank you for this interesting cue card topic as it allows me to talk about an event from my childhood which I remember really well.\n\nBy the way, having a family picnic was like a regular event, mostly on the weekends, for my family when I still was a young boy. Now, I am not quite sure how much the other members of my extended family liked it, but my grandfather just loved it so much.\n\nSo, anyway, the family picnic, I am talking about, was held about 14 years ago from now when I had just finished elementary school, and I was just ready to have all kinds of fun, and watching movies at a theatre just happened to be one of them. But, the problem was that nobody was really there to take me to the movies because everybody was so busy with their works.\n\nSo, I had no other option but to wait till the weekend. Naturally, I felt very bad, but then, my dear grandfather noticed it and decided to come to my rescue. In fact, he offered me to go for a picnic with him except, of course, I wanted to watch a movie instead. Suddenly, my grandfather offered me something which he had never done before - he offered me to do barbeque grill on my own which I had always wanted to do. Needless to say, I felt so excited that I immediately agreed to go with my grandfather to a nearby public park and had a lot of fun with him.\n\nWell, I remember this event so well because it was during this occasion that I did chicken barbeque grill, all on my own, for the first time in my life, and they tasted so amazingly delicious! I remember it so well also because my grandfather treated me like a “big boy” for the first time on that day."

    "Answer": "Well, this is a very nice topic for me and I would love to talk about one of my most memorable childhood events that I had with my family members. The celebration was to welcome a new guest in our family- my nephew who was born on that day. My eldest sister gave birth to a beautiful and healthy baby boy on that particular day. I was around 8 years old then.\n\nAfter my father saw the newborn baby for the first time, he declared that this is a special occasion for us. As this is the first baby in our family, he decided that the occasion must be celebrated to welcome the new guest in our family. The event and the celebration both took place in our house which is in Danville.\n\nAs soon as my father affirmed that we would celebrate this very special day, every one of our family got busy with the arrangement. My parents went to invite guests and to do some necessary shopping. I was so happy and excited that I also called some of my friends to enjoy the event. I wanted to be near the newborn baby all the time and when my mother told me to give some time to the mother and baby alone, I felt quite sad and depressed. I could not believe that such a beautiful baby is my nephew and I wanted to touch him and play with him all the time. However, the sad feeling was so momentary in this case and I forgot it in a few minutes. Then I started playing and gossiping with my friends who by the meantime have come to visit us.\n\nIt was a different day – in terms of happiness, amazement and celebration. The arrival of a gorgeous baby and a huge celebration to welcome the event brought us unbound happiness and reasons to smile. My mother, with her sister, cooked many delicious dishes and we enjoyed the foods with so many friends and relatives. The large cake that my elder brother bought from a pastry shop was another delight and surprise for us.\n\nThis was a very happy event for all our family members, close friends, neighbours and relatives. I still remember this special family event very vividly for the immense joy and happiness it brought for us."

    "Answer": "Christmas is always a happy event for me and my family. In fact, this was the time when we all meet together and had fun.\n\nIn such a Christmas, my parents, I and my three other siblings went to my grandpa’s house in Brisbane, Australia. All of my Relatives gathered there marking the occasion like the former years. Actually, all of my uncles remained busy with their respective business and it becomes impossible for them to meet without any extreme emergencies. Thereby, it becomes the happiest event for all of us to get together for Christmas. Receiving gifts is an attractive matter for me. I received more gifts than the others being the smallest daughter of the family. Besides, the foods prepared at the event were appealing for me as well.  \n\nThe Christmas gathering took place on December 25 in 2005. All of my relatives gathered in my grandpa’s place one or two days before the event. I have two paternal uncles and three aunts. They arrived with their kids. On the other side, we were six in number. So, it was almost a medium-scale crowd there. Everyone greeted each other and shared their feelings. Additionally, my grandparents were extremely happy with this crowd of people. Actually, they are to live almost alone round the year and this is the time when they have chances to spend some quality moments. My grandpa was a retired professor of Physics while my grandma took care of the house. My parents or uncles were unable to meet them on regular days for their hefty schedules. The gathering was arranged each year to keep the bondage alive among all. So, at this time of the year, we made the gathering at my grandpa’s place.\n\nI did a large number of things at this event. But there were no specific patterns of my activities. Papa took a leave for a week from his office and we reached on grandpa’s home on the day before Christmas for preparation like lighting the Christmas tree, preparing gifts for the family members, decorating the home and so on. It may sound unusual that I did not take part in any preparation activities because I considered it a leisure time for me. An example may make it clear. I used to get up early in the morning to attend my school in typical days. But I woke up late on the Christmas day that I missed the grand breakfast with all. So, my day began at around 11 am. After breakfast, I started moving here and there inside the house. But on my normal days, the scenario is quite different.\n\nI can remember the event so well for several reasons. Firstly, this was the annual family gathering for my family. I was able to meet all the relatives in person at this event. We all had extreme fun at this event. Besides, I received the best gifts of my life in this event. I turned 13 in the next month but received my birthday gifts in advance. My grandpa presented me with a nice jigsaw puzzle game while my aunts and uncles also presented me with attractive presents. Moreover, the evening was wonderful - we all gathered by a fire in the lawn and had a special barbeque and dinner. Considering all the aspects, it was a wonderful event. So, the memories are still vivid in my mind."

    "Answer": "I have always loved taking long journeys, especially, if they are taken by train. But, I never thought that a short journey could also be just as much fun as taking a long journey, just as it was when I travelled to a scenic spot, not too far away from where I currently live now.\n\nIt was during the weekend about a few months ago when I, together with a couple of friends, decided to get away from our boring routine life in our motorbikes. By the way, riding a motorbike is one of my most favourite things to do. But, it became a matter of excitement when one of my friends had just bought a new motorbike, and we just couldn’t wait to ride that newly-bought bike.\n\nSo, as soon as the very next weekend arrived, we took our backpacks and took off. It was only a couple of hours’ trip, but since we were riding our bikes slowly, it took us like almost 2 hours to reach to that scenic spot. It took us that long also because we actually stopped at a couple of places in order to refresh us with some drinks and snacks. Not sure if those snacks were home-made, but they tasted very fresh and delicious. Besides, as we were riding along, we were also singing in chorus in order to make us feel like we were some free birds which just got released from their cage.\n\nWe chose that scenic spot, with a beautiful lake in it as well as some really picturesque woodland with all kinds of trees, because it has an elevated landscape from where a picture-perfect sunset could be viewed.\n\nWell, I would like to make that short trip again, mainly because I didn’t really have to make a lot of arrangement for it. Besides, the trip also offered me the opportunity to discover my own city from a different perspective which, up and until then, I had taken for granted."

    "Answer": "Two years ago I went to my sister’s father-in-law’s house and it was indeed a long and exciting journey that I would love to make again. I went there with my parents and my younger brother to meet my newly married sister and her in-laws. This was a suburban area called Villa Maloti and it was so beautiful that I initially couldn’t believe it. The serene and mesmerising nature, lake, picturesque roads and houses and a simple and traditional lifestyle of people took my heart away. It was like a perfect world in someone’s dream.\n\nThis area was more than 700 km away from our living place and we needed to change our vehicles 3-4 times to actually reach there. Interestingly instead of making us tired and bored, the journey actually revived us. I can think of three reasons for that. One – we were very excited to meet our relatives; two – the side view was unbelievably beautiful and pleasant; three- we had such a family tour after a long. I actually want to make this journey all over again only because this was quite a remarkable journey and I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nAfter we left our home, we took a taxi to reach the train station. The train was about 40 minutes late and during that time I read a newspaper. I also checked the news on my mobile phone. Our train journey was for 4 hours and during that time I mostly enjoyed the natural beauty of the passing villages. We had our breakfast on the train. After we left the train we had to take two different buses and finally a taxi to reach our destination. During the bus journey, I either talked with my mom or read the storybook I took with me. This was an interesting journey and I enjoyed most of it. I wish to visit that picturesque and beautiful suburban area again and meet my lovely younger sister who got married. The soothing experience of the train journey and the chance to stay away from the busy city life are the reasons I would love to make this journey again. In fact, I am very much looking forward to making the journey once again soon."

    "Answer": "Travelling is a great tonic and a mind refresher. This is why I never miss chances of travelling. In 2013, I went to visit Portugal with my family. The trip was an ever reminding one. I would like to make another trip to the country if I could manage.  \n\nI live in Nepal with my family. My father arranged to take a vacation in Portugal with his entire family. As part of the decision, we all went to Portugal. Being a European country, it is enriched with beauties. The dark blue skies attracted me the most. Moreover, we all visited the attractive places in the country. But initially, it was a problem for us to communicate with the people living there as my father only knew English, while my mother and the other kids – including me, were unable to speak the language. So, we had to remain silent all the time.  \n\nMy father is a researcher and was invited to participate in a conference of European environmental researchers which was set in Portugal. So, he planned to make it a family trip and accordingly arranged everything. In fact, the organisation that invited father agreed to accommodate all the members but the expenses should be met by my father's end. When everything was settled, we started the journey and stayed there for over three weeks. My father was busy with his conference while I with the other members travelled across cities and places. I also attended the conference for a session and found it boring to me. So, despite several invitations from father to assist him in the conference, I denied them trickily and focused on travelling on the streets of the city we were staying.\n\nThe list will not end if I start mentioning the things I did there. To make the long story short- I did all the possible things a tourist does in Portugal. I visited some of the towns like Evora, Porto and knew about their histories. The background of the cities amazed me. On a weekend, we went to visit Madeira, one of the most impressive spots in the country. We also enjoyed the ruins in Sintra. While travelling through the ruins, I tried imagining the past- how people lived there and what their lifestyle was. In fact, I started roaming in the past of the ruins that developed a sense to realise the meaning of life in me. I also visited the Lisbon Oceanarium, a place of wonder. Walking on the streets and taking food from the roadside stores were remarkable. It was a kind of experience for me.  \n\nI believe that I am a born traveller. It has been over three years since I made the journey. I miss the natural scenes like enjoying the sunset sitting on the hilltop or running across the streets, enjoying movies in theatre halls, delicious foods, the language barriers, the jovial attitude of the natives, sightseeing, etc. My memories remind me of the events in that foreign land. I have visited Nepal completely and Portugal was my first out of the country destination. I have a plan to visit the majority of the European nations but will start it by visiting Portugal. The country charmed be with plenty of its attractions and so I would like to get back to them once again."

    "Answer": "I must admit that when I was in high school, I wasn’t among the brightest of the students. But, it was even more so when it came to learning mathematics. In fact, I didn’t just dislike the subject but also dreaded it for the most part back then.\n\nOf course, I tried really hard to improve my mathematical skills by spending a significant amount of time on learning this subject, but unfortunately, the more I was trying, the more it felt like the same. I couldn’t blame my mathematics teachers either for my poor performance on this subject because, to tell the truth, they also tried their best to teach me the subject.\n\nAnyway, I and my parents tried really hard to find out the reasons behind such poor mathematical skills, but we couldn’t really manage to come up with any tangible reasons for that back then. In fact, as I come to think of it now, I guess we weren’t just smart enough to find out the reasons, to begin with, back then, after all, we were not experts in this regard.\n\nBut, as far as exactly why I didn’t like mathematics, I guess, it's simply because I didn’t have the proper foundation in this hard subject which was much needed for success. Besides, it is also very much possible that I considered math as the collection of some abstract and irrelevant figures that were really boring and thus also difficult to understand. By the way, I still don’t like mathematics (even though, I eventually got little better in it), but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it didn’t help me in life.\n\nIn fact, it is because of learning mathematics that I have somewhat acquired the power of reasoning in order to prevent chaos in my life. Besides, it also has nurtured the much-needed daily problem-solving abilities in me, like how much empty space my living room should have after arranging all the furniture in it, or how fast I need to drive to beat the morning traffics."

    "Answer": "Hindsight is a wonderful thing, isn’t it?  Sometimes over time, you come to completely change your mind about something, even though you never could have imagined you would.  It’s the same for me a subject I spent some time studying when I was younger, and I absolutely loathed it.  Now, I realise that subject – or more accurately skill – is one of my strongest assets, it has definitely helped me in life, in more ways than I could possibly have realised at the time.\n\nSo I’ll explain what the subject is, what I think about it now and why … together with how that’s changed from when I was first learning it, and then I’ll try and explain how it has helped me in life, but that could take a while!\n\nStrictly speaking, this wasn’t a topic I learned at school, but after I left it.  I enrolled at a local college because they were offering a free ‘Intensive Secretarial Course’ and at the time I didn’t have a job so I thought it would be something worthwhile to learn whilst I was doing some volunteering and looking for proper work.  The course was many years ago, believe it or not, this was before the internet, and even before networked computers!   The course covered typing and shorthand, and also how to lay out business letters properly.  Truthfully, I never got the hang of shorthand.  The lessons were after lunch and after a few weeks, I stopped going to those sessions as I found that ‘accidentally on purpose’ they clashed with my volunteering…  I did, however, persevere with typing.  Now I can touch type with ease, far faster than I could write anything, and just as fast as I can think.  I don’t know that I ‘like’ it exactly, it has become as natural to me as breathing.  I just couldn’t imagine being without this skill, it is so, so useful.\n\nWhy didn’t I like studying it at the time?  Where to begin.  It was just so boring and repetitive.  What’s more, I learned how to type using a manual typewriter, banging out nonsensical phrases on what would now seem to be ancient machines.  You had to hit the keys quite fiercely or they wouldn’t strike the inked ribbon hard enough to leave a mark.  If you weren’t careful you could actually get your fingers caught between the metal keys.  Uurgh, it was horrible!  If you made a mistake using carbon paper (that’s the inked paper you used to have to place in between clean sheets if you were making more than one copy of a document) you had to carefully wind out the paper from the machine, ease the pages apart and using liquid paper corrector paint over the mistakes in ever document. It was incredibly fiddly and frustrating.  The shorthand classes were even worse!  We had to practise taking dictation from a very serious looking woman who read from an archaic book with rather old-fashioned ideas about how women should behave in the workplace.  I remember one phrase was ‘and don’t forget ladies, when dressing for the office, your nail varnish, shoes, handbag and other accessories should always match!’  I was horrified.  Is that all women were supposed to be?  Ornaments for the office?  No wonder I stopped going to those classes.\n\nThe funny thing is, although the course felt like the longest 6 months of my life at the time, it was also fantastically useful.  Being able to type helped me straight away both in looking for work and performing once appointed.  I could do everything from being able to create my own professional looking CV, complete smart-looking application forms and was able to write up my own reports and letters without secretarial support once I started working.  This made me a much quicker and more independent worker than my non-typing colleagues.  Later on, when computers were introduced, I was way faster than others replying to emails.  They were straining over a keyboard picking out the letters one by one, whereas I could touch type comfortably at 70 words a minute!  I also found knowing how to produce professionally presented reports and documents gave me a great advantage not only in time, but in how my work was perceived.  The only downside was, that I became much more comfortable typing than writing by hand, my handwriting got worse and worse from that point on, now it is barely legible at all!\n\nNowadays touch typing has enabled me to keep a number of blogs, carry on correspondence with people all over the world, and exchange letters with friends and family over many years.  In a world where computers are everywhere, I am grateful I can use a keyboard with ease.  Though I am left wondering one thing, just as when I learned to type I could never have anticipated how it would be so useful to me later on, I wonder if in the future keyboards too will become a thing of the past.  Perhaps we will all have voice-activated computers and the image of me sweating over a manual typewriter back in the eighties will seem an even stranger picture than it already does today!"

    "Answer": "The subject I liked the least in my school life was history and interestingly I love to read history-related books a lot these days and this subject has helped me quite a lot in my life.\n\nHistory was a mandatory subject throughout my academic years in school and somehow I felt very less passionate about this subject at that time. After I reached my university level, I started reading some storybooks that were related to historical events in our continent and that grew a great passion in me regarding history. I should probably add that History channel is my most favourite TV channels as it shows some great programmes which are not only interesting but also great sources of knowledge and information. The main reason I like history nowadays is because of my career as a journalist and the valuable lessons the history can offer us. I believe that histories were made by our ancestors and we could always learn from their great actions and mistakes to make this world a better place to live in.\n\nI did not like history as a subject in school probably because the teachers failed to present this subject in an interesting way or I was too much interested in subjects like math, chemistry and physics. I was partially responsible for the lack of my interest in this subject as I did not try to get deeper inside it and I read very few books related to history by then.\n\nThe history shaped the world we live in now and every single event in history has a great influence to change the world that we see now. From this regards, I took this subject seriously and the valuable lessons I learned from it changed my life. For instance, after reading so many books related to wars, I have decided not to get involved in any kind of quarrel with others as quarrels, wars, selfishness can only bring catastrophes. I also learned about the greatest people in human history and how their hard work, determination and willingness have made them the exemplary persons in the worlds and how they contributed towards a better world. The things I learned from history books and from other sources helped me a lot as a writer in my personal and professional life. I would say the contribution of history, as a subject or interest, has a great effect on my life."

    "Answer": "Until I had reached the college-going age, my parents would never leave me alone unless it was absolutely necessary, and that too only for a couple of days at max. But, they had to break this unwritten rule (of not leaving me alone for long) for a few times when I was a young high school student. Let me tell me what exactly happened.\n\nBack in my high school years about 12 years ago, I was rather passionate about playing chess. In fact, I became so good at playing this game that I even became a champion in a district level tournament. Naturally, I became more ambitious and so was my school game teacher, as we both wanted to take my chess playing skills to a different level, and the only way we could do it was to take part in a national youth championship tournament which is held every year in the capital city of my country.\n\nLuckily, I even got a ticket to take part in the next national chess tournament after playing a few trial matches against some really formidable opponents of my country. Now, all I needed was to get permission from my parents to leave my home and spend about two weeks at a hotel in our capital city until the tournament was over. But, as expected, when my parents heard about my plan, they vehemently protested the idea. But, eventually, they calmed down when my game teacher had managed to convince them that he would take good care of me.\n\nAnyway, as long as I stayed away from my parents, I was both excited and nervous also at the same time: excited because I was able to compete against so many great chess players of my country while staying at a great place, and nervous because I never stayed away from my family for such a long time before. But, all in all, it was a great experience because it had allowed me to cope with new situations."

    "Answer": "Till I turned to 16, I can’t recall any even when I stayed far away from home alone. Though I visited some of my relatives who stayed far away from our living place, on all those occasions, either of my parents or both of them were with me. For this cue card topic, I will talk about an event when I stayed far away from my home, where I went, how long I stayed there and my feelings about staying far away from home.\n\nI went to Denmark when I was 19 years old as part of a tour that our college arranged. That was a 7-day tour to explore a different country. I went to Denmark and stayed in a hotel that our college booked for us.\n\nAs I remember I stayed there for about 7 days and that was indeed my first stay in a place quite far away from my home. The day we reached there, I was quite fascinated to be in a different country. We reached there in the evening and checked in a hotel. I got a small single room where I stayed for 4 days. After we move to Odense in South Denmark, we stayed in a different hotel but this time, I had to share the room with one of my classmates and luckily the room was large enough for two of us to share.\n\nWe did numerous things during our stay including visiting museums, camping, completing an assignment, visiting two other colleges in Denmark and meeting with the students there and visiting different historically significant places in Denmark. Some of the experiences, including dining, visiting local markets and meeting local people were some distinctive experiences for me.\n\nI would say I was very excited about the whole tour and everything we did and participated in were very enthralling. This was the first time I stayed so long in a distant place without any family members. I called my parents almost every day and I missed them quite often. They were worried about me and called me now and then to learn what I was doing and whether everything was okay or not. I missed my own room, my little sister and parents but that did not make me homesick due to the stirring experience and time I was having.\n\nI did not feel how much I missed my house, parents and little sister until I returned home, as, seeing all of them and getting back to my own house gave me a unique feeling I never felt before. It was like getting back to a place and people I love most."

    "Answer": "When I was in my college days, I had to get separated from my family for a couple of years until my under graduation was completed. It happened as the university was located in a different state – Texas.\n\nIn fact, I was born and brought up in Missouri while I had to take higher education in another state. Dad wanted me to keep me out of the home so that I could learn about the world and be a practical person. So, I enrolled myself at Texas Christian University in 2011. I took Political Science and Sociology as my course because of my former academic background. Moreover, the university I picked was one of the best one in the state, Texas, with some reputed faculties.    \n\nI had to stay for around four years in the state due to the academic activities. I had to cross the initial stages to reach in the next phases of the degree. I enjoyed the academic texts and other assignments related to my courses. Passing a long time out of home was a bit troublesome and made me nostalgic. It was the longest time for me to live without my family. But I went back to Missouri on different occasions and celebrated notable events. I missed each and every member of my family, especially my pet dog. So, when the undergraduate was over, I felt a sense of relief. But passing moments in Texas was interesting in some aspects.     \n\nGone are the days when I used to make sudden trips with my university buddies. To complete my undergraduate, I had to study in Texas, a different state from where I was born. In fact, I was sent to be a warrior to deal with the modern and competitive world. My dad wanted me to be a perfect man to deal with every adversity of life. Now I admire his decision – how right he was. In Texas, I did lots of things. Most of the times, I used to move with my best friends in different outings and enjoyed them to the fullest extent. Group study before the exams was the most attractive thing for me and my friends. We used to wake up late at night and studied the untouched topics of the class. The exam results were satisfactory. The days passed in all such activities.    \n\nI am quite happy with my stay in Texas. Though I felt a bit homesick in the beginning, gradually I overcame the feeling. It was one of the greatest experience in my life that has made me stronger, confident, have gained leadership skills, achieved some awards and overall now I am able to battle with the competitive world. Everyone in the present age is racing, they are racing against time. So, to keep pace and compete with others, people are in need of some special set of skills and expertise. I have developed almost all of the real-life skills and now exercising them. Consequently, I am leading a decent and happy life with my family. Staying far from home has taught me the best lessons of my life."

    "Answer": "As a junior college student, I had to go through a number of situations when I was offered some advice, even though, I wasn’t really too much fond of such “unwarranted” advice. Today, I would like to talk about one such situation which I thought was really useful.\n\nAnyway, when I was attending junior college, I wasn’t only young but also perhaps a bit restless and adventurous for my own good. So,  all of my family members, especially, my father and the eldest cousin, were a bit concerned about my safety when I was riding their motorbikes since I already had a few accidents. However, that adventurous and restless “me” also had a positive side – a positive side which encouraged me to save up some money little by little from my daily tiffin allowance.\n\nI continued to do this saving thing for almost two years, although I never told anybody about my reasons to do so. But, when I noticed that I had just about money, saved up, to buy a cheap motorbike, I broke the news to everybody in my family. Naturally, all of them became very proud and excited after learning the news of my saved-up money, but they, especially my father and the eldest cousin, also sounded equally unyielding at the same time in their decision to prevent me from buying a motorbike. Instead, they advised me to put the money in a trust fund because they thought that an “adventurous” me with a motorbike would probably be too risky for the safety of my own as well as of the other public.\n\nAnyway, the advice, offered by my father and cousin, proved out to be one of the most useful pieces of advice of my life because it helped me earn a substantial amount of money (substantial for a 20 years old that is) within the next couple of years. Besides, the advice also helped me utilize my time more wisely which otherwise would be wasted in riding a motorbike or taking care of it."

    "Answer": "I was a bit confused while picking the situation when I received some useful advice from others and finally I decided to talk about the advice I got from my father when I was in my early teenage.\n\nThere was no particular situation or reason my father gave me some advice. In one evening I was sitting near him and watching TV. I was then 14 years old and was very fond of quiz shows. Both of us were enjoying the programme and a few minutes later my father asked me about my school. That was a bit embarrassing to talk about since my recent exam result was disappointing. He then told me some fascinating stories from his childhood and how he felt about school, study and other stuff. My father has a natural talent for telling compelling stories or maybe I love his stories because I like him very much. At one point I was so amazed to learn that he was very much like me and had more passion for playing, hanging out with friends than studying. He then explained to me the importance of studying very attentively and how my academic performance will determine my future. If the advice had not been received from my father, I might have taken it very lightly. But when he told me how he had changed himself and achieved excellence in his academic results and how that has helped him to achieve a career he always dreamt about, I took it very seriously. The best point about this conversation was that I did not feel like I was being lectured or intentionally delivered some good advice. I thought about what my father advised me and I was really captivated about the idea that my academic excellence can someday make me a person I want to be. I was really enthralled about what I want to be in the future and my father’s advice made it clear to me that I will have to study hard to achieve this in my life.\n\nI won’t say I have achieved an excellent academic record, but this advice helped me to become interested in learning and studying. Things could have been quite different for me if I did not receive the advice in proper time. This is the reason I consider it the best advice I have ever received from anyone. This advice grew the interest of reading and learning in me and that’s the best part of my life so far."

    "Answer": "When I was in my college, I decided to start a coffee shop at the street where the college was located. I had a partner with me to start the business but a friend of mine advised me not to start the business. He was correct and his advice saved me from a huge loss.\n\nIn fact, to earn some cash to continue the academic expenses, I wanted to open a small business. After lots of research, I found that a coffee shop would be fine for me. Besides, I also selected a partner to run the shop. The idea appeared in my mind while I was drinking coffee at a small shop located nearby my college. So, I thought that it would be beneficial for me to have such a shop and with the earnings, I would be able to meet my expenses. I feel shy asking for money to dad. So, I decided to start my own small business.\n\nMy childhood friend, Jonny was my advisor. I always seek advice from him for his extraordinary intellectual level and ability to judge the situations. Almost all of his advice was effective and beneficial for me. So, in this scenario, I asked him to suggest something that how can I run the business. The advice he gave me was really impressive. Though in the beginning, I could not agree with him for the reasons he showed, later I thought that he was right in every aspect. Besides, Jonny was a boy of practicality and he did not compromise with the emotions. But he was not a rough and tough man at all. He used to adjust to the situations and did accordingly after the situation demands.\n\nWhen I described the intention to open up a small business, like a coffee shop, at the college street, Jonny suggested me not to open the shop. Besides, he advised me to keep patience and continue the study. Hearing the suggestion, I was astonished and thought that he might be jealous of my potential earning and success. So, I wanted to avoid him and his advice. He also said that my partner was not a trustworthy man. Moreover, the partner I selected was not insincere and I might not be able to continue the partnership for a long, he commented. Jonny asked me to think about the issue again and again, and then to decide either I will continue or not.     \n\nThe advice was extremely useful to me for several reasons. I followed the advice and did not open the business. Jonny told me that there is a skyrocketed competition among the existing coffee shops, and actually, there are a substantial number of small coffee shops in the college street. So, if I opened a new one, I would have to struggle a lot to survive in the business. Moreover, I was wrong in partner selection. Three months later, the man I teamed up with chose another partner, a friend of mine, and opened a new coffee shop at the same place where I intended to run my business. But unfortunately, they failed to attract new customers and keep pace with the immense competition. There were some other internal business issues between them, told my friend, like lack of transparency and trust. The advice was beneficial for me as if I started the business with that man, I had to suffer a huge amount of financial loss."

    "Answer": "I have always enjoyed sharing things with others, especially, if those things help their causes. Today, I would like to talk about one of those things which I shared with a roommate of mine when I was a college student.\n\nIt was about 8 years ago or so when I was living with a roommate in the same room at a hostel. Even though we used to study in different faculties, we both used to get along nicely. However, the room, we were sharing, was a bit too small for our liking. Or it at least looked small to us, probably because we had too many things in that room.\n\nAnyway, whether the room was really small or not, we struggled really hard to put two study tables side by side.  But, the situation became a bit too tricky when I bought a desktop computer and a large computer desk to set that computer on. In fact, after setting up my computer desk, there hardly any space left to keep my roommate’s study table. Seeing no other options, I offered my roommate to get rid of his study table and share my computer desk to study. I even offered him to share my computer if he ever needed to. Not to mention, my good roommate gladly accepted my proposal and immediately got rid of his small study table.\n\nAfter making that arrangement, initially, we had some problems in organizing our books and other pieces of stuff on my computer desktop, but that issue got solved too as we both started to utilize the space on the desk a bit more smartly.\n\nAnyway, I needed to share it with my roommate, mainly because I wanted to ensure that my roommate also got his fair share of our room. After all, he got rid of his study table to accommodate my computer desk. But, it sure felt great to me that I shared my table and computer with my roommate because it did help him a lot in studying and doing his homework better."

I believe that human is a social being and we need to share so many things with our relatives, friends and unknown persons on different occasions. I will talk about a time when I shared my room with one of my cousins who suddenly visited our house a few months ago.\n\nI have my personal room where I usually live along. We have two guests room and that’s why I have never shared my room with anyone who stays our house at night. A few months ago when my cousin came to visit our home, we were renovating our second floor and that’s why we had no spare room for the guests. My cousin, Stephen, came to our town all of a sudden and informed us that he would need to stay in our town for a couple of days. He also informed me that he is planning to stay in a hotel. My father insisted him to stay with us and I thought I could easily share my room with him for a couple of days. He was 2 years younger to me but we had a friendly relationship from our childhood.\n\nStephen stayed two nights in our house and I shared my room, bed and bathroom with him so that he can stay in our house comfortably. We talked about our grandparents, other cousins, our works and future plans. I enjoyed his company and we had good times together. I am not habituated to share my very personal belongings and rooms with others, but sharing it with my one of the most favourite cousins was not a bad experience at all. In fact, during his stay, we had so many fun events that I invited him to visit our house again."

    "Answer": "Sharing things with others brings a sense of comfort and self-satisfaction in me. So, I like to share possible things with others. Last month, I shared my meal with one of my mates at university.\n\nI am an undergraduate student at the Paris Dauphine University , and studying math. I like to have homemade food and I often bring my lunch with me from home. My mom also discourages taking outside foods. Hence, she prepares foods for me. I shared the meal with another girl who forgot to bring her meal on that day. It is nothing new to me to share my stuff. I saw her sitting idle during the lunch hour and inquired about taking the meal. She smiled and told me that she forgot to bring her lunch. Therefore, I shared my meal.\n\nUsually, the lunch break in the university begins at 12.45 pm. But most of the times our classes end by 12.30 pm. If there are classes after lunch, we are to stay at the university premise. On that day I had to attend a class at 2.30 pm. So, I brought the meal to have during lunch. In fact, the class was supposed to be held in the morning but the teacher – in the previous day, informed the class that he will take the class in the afternoon as he is unable to manage time in the morning for some other academic business. Accordingly, we all were prepared for the class. But she forgot about the class and made the mistake.    \n\nI shared my meal with Lillian. She is an Irish and came here to study with a scholarship. She lives alone in Paris and is a part-time executive at a company that deals with the computer. She got a partial scholarship and so she needs to arrange for her living expenses. She remains busy round the day to make a balance between her academic and job life. Thereby, it is possible for her to forget about the meal. Actually, she often makes mistakes in bringing the necessary assignments and projects. She returns home late at night and it becomes impossible for her to organise the necessary documents or projects for the class. So, she makes late in preparing and importantly forgets to bring them in class. The teachers are aware of her struggling situations and they are flexible with her on such issues.  \n\nI know Lillian from the very first day and she is now a close mate to me. So, I know about her struggling conditions. She left her home for some unavoidable reasons and with her ambition, she wants to grow. This is really a matter of pride and everyone cannot do so. it requires strong determination. I know that she might have forgotten to bring the lunch and if I do not share mine with her, I think she could not manage time before supper to take her meal. In fact, her occupational engagement will not allow her to take a break. So, I shared my lunch with her. I felt a sense of relief by helping her. It was really a great mental satisfaction for me."

But, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they always get to eat with me or my family except when my sister-in-law is around. After all, my dear mother is old, and as such, she doesn’t really have the needed energy or motivation to feed or entertain my friends at home.\n\nSo, when a couple of close friends asked me about a few weeks ago to give them some nice treat because I got a salary raise at my job, my dear mother “ordered” me to take them to a good restaurant and feed them all they could. My mother, of course, was kind enough to offer to pay for the restaurant bills, but I politely refused to take her money.\n\nAnyway, the restaurant, where we went to, wasn’t exactly a very fancy or upscale one, rather it was an average restaurant which served some really good food at a very affordable price. And I knew about their food because I had visited this restaurant a few times. However, my friends were initially reluctant to go to that restaurant, but, when I assured them about the quality of their food, they changed their minds. They even fell in love with that restaurant after eating their Teriyaki chicken, vegetable and shrimp tempura, and buckwheat noodles flavoured with soy sauce.  \n\nYes, the restaurant served mostly Japanese dishes, but they sure knew how to cook and serve them in the best possible manner. By the way, my friends thanked me at least a dozen times because I gave them the opportunity to eat some of the best Japanese dishes in the town.\n\nWell, I invited my friends to have this meal with me, mainly because they are the best friends of mine who always stick with me through thick and thin. Besides, this meal also offered us a great opportunity to have some light moments with each other which we were missing for a long time."

They were John, Eric, Stephen, Anny and Bikash.\n\nI threw this treat in the ‘Royal Case Inn’ that offers the best buffet meals in the town. This place was only 20 minutes away from our office and we had our lunch there on Monday. The restaurant was o the 18th floor and we went there at around 12:45 pm together from our office.\n\nThere were plenty of food items for us which were included in our buffet lunch menu. I can recall more than 30 items were presented in the restaurant for the customers.\n\nWe ate different food items based on our own choices and tastes. Some of the items which we all ate were Thai soup, fried rice, mixed salad, mutton curry, gravy fish items, opinion mixed fish and ice cream.\n\n Usually, it is a common practice in our office to treat others whenever someone gets promoted. As soon as I got the confirmation letter about the promotion from the higher management, those colleges congratulated me and reminded me of the treat. I was very happy to have been promoted as a senior executing in this multination company and threw this meal to celebrate."

    "Answer": "I was born and brought up in a family in India where all the members love to entertain people, especially the guests. So, I inherited nature from my early childhood and love to entertain people as well. Last month, I invited some of my colleagues to be my guest at my home in Mumbai.\n\nI have joined a local company dealing with toiletries in the local market of India. I have been working with the company for the past two months and the most junior employee at the workplace. As I love to socialise, I invited some of my colleagues to take lunch with me. I wanted to hold the lunch at a restaurant but they denied and wanted to meet my family members. In fact, they took me as one of them cordially and thus wanted to grow the relationship. As part of their plan, I asked them to join for lunch at my house.\n\nI live with my parents and other family members near Marine Drive in Mumbai. Luckily, the members are liberal and free from all sorts of superstitions. So, the other families living nearby, irrespective of religions, have a very good relation with us. When my mother learnt about the invitation, she was glad to cook meals for the guests. But some of the invitees were non-Muslims and thus they required some special types of foods. Hence, my mother decided to prepare something special that could be taken by all. On the scheduled day, my colleagues arrived at my home. They were eight in number and brought lots of sweets and seasonal fruits with them as it was their first visit to my place.\n\nMy mother prepared the traditional chicken biriyani for the guests. Since some of the colleagues did not take beef while the rest had troubles with pork, my mother made a great solution. The chicken was edible to all. So, she prepared the items with chicken to avoid any controversy. Everyone was glad about the menu. Besides, she also made chatni, borhani – a spicy drink, chicken kebabs, fish cutlets, plain rice, different smashes, and chicken curry. In fact, I informed her that some of my colleagues do not prefer rich foods. Accordingly, she arranged several items for them but everyone was allowed to taste those. My colleagues took the meal with great satisfaction.\n\nSocialising is a habit for me that I have been cultivating since my childhood. So, I love to mix with people and entertain them. In fact, this is a tradition of my family that anyone who enters into the compound should take something, at least aa glass of water. Hence, my nature has turned so, I love to socialise and invite people at home. Besides, when someone visits me, a cordial relation between us develops. I know the importance of good relationships and how it impacts on situations. Considering all the aspects, I invited my colleagues. But it appeared that they were more cordial and socialising than me. Earlier, I took pride in my such behaviour but they proved me wrong. They took me for granted as a trusty colleague and had met with my entire family. The pleasures I derived were precious indeed."

    "Answer": "Perhaps I have never been intelligent or smart enough to understand the importance of the years which have already passed by. But, in the greater scheme of things, I think that the final year of my university was an important year in my life.\n\nIt was the year of 2015 when I was not only excited about finishing my university but also nervous at the same time because I just didn’t know what kind of profession I was going to choose after ending my formal educational life.\n\nPrior to that year, of course, my parents and elder brother had advised me on numerous occasions to settle down with the thought of a particular career path, but I was perhaps a bit too immature (“immature” for a 22 years old that is) to make up my mind. So, the nearer my graduation day was approaching, the more I was becoming restless. After all, I needed to decide what I was going to do for the rest of my life, and I needed to do it as fast as possible without wasting any more time.\n\nAnyway, as a lot of thoughts and calculations was going in my head, I decided to fall back on the advice of those persons who I always had conveniently ignored up and until that point. Yes, I decided to talk to my father and elder brother who, I knew, was going to “chew me” up for my dangerously carefree attitude. But, of course, I was proved wrong by them as, instead of “tearing” me up for my abject failure to decide on a career path, they actually offered me some serious career advice, based on my “personality”.\n\nAnyway, the year of 2015 was an important year of my life, primarily because it was in this year that I learned that I needed to become my “own” man instead of depending on somebody else. Besides, in this year, I also learned the value of proper planning in life for the first time."

    "Answer": "Well, picking an important year was bit header as so many important events took place in different years in my life. However, out of those, I would like to talk about the year 2002 which I consider as one of the most important years in my life.\n\nI went to visit my uncle’s house in the year 2000 and stayed there for about three weeks. During my visit, I learned a lesson that has changed my perspective of my life and that was probably the most significant turning point in my life. I was 16 years old then.\n\nWhile staying there I went to the sea beach, which was about 5 kilometres away from my uncle’s house, with one of my cousins. We went there without informing our guardians and thought that we would return before the dusk without anyone noticing. While swimming in the seawater, we were enjoying a lot and the big tides of the sea made our experience more enthralling. All of a sudden I noticed that the sands below my feet were no longer presents and at the same time a giant tide hit me. I was quite afraid and was again hit by a giant tide from the reverse direction. That tide took me a long away from the beach and I was really frightened. I am a good swimmer but at that very moment my body froze in terror and I could not move my muscle. I could see the anxious eyes of distant people and for the first time in life, I thought that I was going to die. That was an experience I can’t express in words. I had no idea about the time and many things from my childhood were flashing back in my mind. I felt that I was drowning even after my desperate try to survive. Things were becoming blurred and I think I started losing my conscious.    \n\nI don’t know how long I had been in this state. All of a sudden I felt like some force was pulling me towards him and the next thing I saw was some curious eyes strangely looking at me. I was actually rescued by some local fishermen who were fishing nearby.\n\nThis event changed me dramatically. I started realising the reality of life and how fragile our life could be. It was a near-death experience that taught me the importance of life, our relationship, the necessity of being humble, prudent, responsible and all other good things an ideal human being should possess. This year had a great influence to help me become who I really am and how I feel about being alive. This is a lesson we experience probably once in a lifetime and from that perspective, the year 2000 is very important to me."

    "Answer": "I believe each of the moments has its own significance in human life. The similar logic implies to years as well. I will remember 2014 throughout the rest of my life as it had the greatest impacts on me. I got married to the girl I loved.\n\nIn 2014, I married Susan. She was one of my classmates at the university. I met her first at the University of Waterloo in Canada. But there were some troubles in convincing her to be in love with me. I met her in the class and fall in love at first sight. But it was not the same for her. It may sound weird - I had to invest a huge amount of time to create a sense of love for me in her heart. At last, I succeeded and she fell in me.  \n\nOnce the relationship between us grew further, in 2014 we decided to tie the knot. But it was not as easy as it sounds. Both of us had to struggle a lot and the most important part was the family approval. The family members did not agree in the beginning considering the surrounding conditions. Besides, they also denied our relationship with many excuses – typical reactions from the family seniors. But the strong determination from our end made it happened. We got married on June 19 in 2014. The arrangement of the marriage was difficult as both of us were non-natives in Canada. She came to Canada for higher study and the same was for me.\n\nSusan was 20 and I was 21 when we got married. In fact, this was not the age to marry but I took no chance of losing her. Both the family members asked us to wait for some years so that we could complete our academic studies but we denied the proposal. In fact, there were chances for both the families for settling in other places and in that case we might lose each other. Besides, there were some other issues. Susan and I had no income to meet the expenses after marriage. It was not possible for any one of us to find a full-time job to support us. But we did not pay heed to such excuses. We were determined to be married at any cost. If Susan had not supported me, I could not have married her at this young age.\n\nI have gathered the most valuable experiences in this year. The faces of my relations were revealed in this year. Besides, the year made me stronger enough to take responsibilities to form a family of my own. I started living with Susan, took a part-time job at a café. By the same time, we continued our studies. She met her expenses with the regular support from her family while my parents stopped spending after me as I did not obey their opinions. I can remember the struggling days. I rushed for the job immediately after the university classes and Susan waited every day for my return from work. But the scenarios are now changed and the struggling days are gone. We are now living happily. I am grateful for the year – 2014. If the events did not happen, I think I was unable to uphold me in the present condition."

    "Answer": "Thank you for this interesting cue card topic as I do love taking my pictures. Of course, it is a totally different thing that I don’t always take the best pictures, but it, no way, lessens my fun in capturing them. But, the picture of me, which was taken by my sister abut a few years ago, was certainly a very good one.\n\nAgain, it happened about a few years ago when my elder sister invited me to visit her just a few months after she had just started her new job at a very prestigious law firm in my country. Since I never really visited that place before, I had no reason to deny her request. Besides, she also told me that she was going to pay for my flight ticket. So, it was like I was getting to eat some great desserts also when all I wanted was some foods.\n\nAfter getting the invitation from my sister, I arranged to fly the very next weekend as my sister had already told me that she wouldn’t be available any other days to accompany me except only during the weekend. So, I did just what my sister had told me and arrived at her place just in time. We did a lot of fun things together, such as visiting the largest shopping mall there (where she bought a very nice winter jacket for me), eating at some fancy and expensive restaurants, and riding boat at a nice lake. By the way, my sister took a picture of me while I was paddling the boat with all my strength. The picture also shows some birds flying over and very close to my head.\n\nWell, I like this photo, mainly because it captured my face with a very natural expression on it. I like the picture also because it depicted all the elements, including the background landscape, the flying birds and the calming effect of the unfazed water, a bit far away from my boat, in perfect synchronization."

    "Answer": "Generally, I hate having my photo taken! I like the idea in theory, but the reality is often very brutal and disappointing. I think perhaps I’m just not very photogenic, and being faced with the truth of how I look with my rapidly expanding waistline and less than glamorous appearance is not always a pleasant experience. However, just occasionally, very occasionally, someone will come up with a photo of me that is genuinely ‘good’. It might not be quite accurate to say I ‘like’ such a photo, but I can appreciate it! I’m going to tell you all about one of my favourite photos that someone took of me. I’ll explain when and where the photo was taken, who took it, what the photo depicts and why it is I like it so much – even though it isn’t a flattering image at all.\n\nSo, the photo was taken just a couple of months ago. It was taken at an event called the Bamford Sheepdog Trials. If you aren’t from a country where sheep are kept, this might not mean anything to you. I’ll try and explain. In the UK, dogs, usually a particular breed called a collie dog, are often used by shepherds to help them herd sheep. They are very well trained to turn in a particular direction, or lie down still, stalk quietly ahead or run on as fast as they can, depending on the particular whistle or verbal command the shepherd gives. Working with a dog in this way is very skilled. In the summer months in rural areas, it’s not uncommon for local agricultural shows to take place where shepherds and their dogs compete to show off their skills. The shepherd commands his dog to herd a small flock of sheep around a course of obstacles in a big field. They have to pass through gates, separate out one particular sheep and so on. These events often take part in glorious countryside, and it is usually the case that as part of the occasion, as well as the sheepdog trials that are the centrepiece of such events, there will be country stalls, sheep-shearing contests and cake-baking competitions. In addition, there will sometimes be a fell race of some sort. It might be up to six miles cross country – often just straight up the nearest hill and back. It is an opportunity for locals to test their fitness against each other in a good humoured race across the county. So it was, that I came to be taking part in the fell race linked to Bamford sheepdog trials, and that is where the photo was taken. Bamford is a little village in the Derbyshire Peak District, England, close to the city of Sheffield where I currently live. I’d heard about the event and thought it would be fun to go out to the countryside and watch the shepherds working with their dogs and sheep to show off their skills. There was indeed also a ‘little fell race’ taking place. At just £5 to enter and only 5 miles long it sounded manageable – I run a bit, though admittedly I hadn’t really done a fell race as such before. Still, Bamford is a beautiful part of the world and I figured it would be a lovely way to see some of the areas by romping up Win Hill (the highest point nearby) and admiring the view before scampering back to the showground at the end.\n\nThe photo was taken by someone I know, who is not a professional photographer, although he is a very, very good amateur one. He often turns out at local running events and specialises in ‘action shots’ of runners in various fell and trail races taking place in the area. His wife was also taking part in the fell run, so he’d come out to support her, and was going to take the opportunity to bring along one of his many super-sophisticated cameras to capture the occasion. There’d be plenty of subject matter to choose from, animals, people, and beautiful scenery – as well as all the runners flying up and down that big hill of course.\n\nAs to the photo he took of me… Well, the short answer is that he snapped a portrait of me at the very moment I crossed the finish line of the fell race. In the photo, both my feet are off the ground, I’m punching the air with one hand, and my other is gesturing in some wild celebratory wave of acknowledgement to the crowd as I seem to be rejoicing at completing the race. My head is thrown back in laughter, and you can see my hair (which is longish) swinging around with the movement. It is a fantastic photo. If you saw it in isolation, you would ‘know’ I must be in the first place, I am ‘obviously’ joyful because I know I have finished victorious, nothing but the first prize could possibly explain my body language! It isn’t a flattering photo because honestly, nobody looks that good when running, and my head angle makes it look as if I have a double chin! (I hope I haven’t really). However, you can’t smile at the photo as it is a great action shot that seems to capture an apparent moment of triumph. The shot is perfectly in focus as well as perfectly timed. It forever records a second of euphoria, communicating all the excitement of the race. You can see my race number on my club vest; the hills in the background, the tape of the finish line in the foreground, spectators applauding me home on either side of the finish funnel. I think there might even be sheep in the far distance, being carefully herded by the sheepdogs as part of the competition. This picture is more than a running portrait of me, it tells the whole story of the event itself. It would make you wish you were there to be part of the occasion I promise you…\n\nSo, why do I like this photo? Well, because it makes me laugh. As I said, you would think from the picture that I had ‘obviously’ come first. In fact, I found the fell race ridiculously hard! The route seemed to just go vertically up a mountain, which was more like climbing than running.  Coming down was even worse, far too steep for me to be brave enough to do much more than picking my way down gingerly and slowly – I wasn’t going to be running any of that! Within a few hundred metres of the start, all the other runners had disappeared out of sight. I was way, way behind everyone else, and held onto that place for the next hour and a quarter! For the whole run, I couldn’t even see the other competitors ahead as they had sped away so fast. I’d imagined this would be a ‘fun’ event with lots of ‘have a go’ runners who, like me, just turned up on the day to romp round as best they could. Instead, it seems it is a highly competitive annual event, people had trained all year to take on this mountain challenge. I was woefully ill-prepared. So it is, that this picture, far from showing me returning victorious in the first place, is a picture of me coming in last.  Not just last, but last by some minutes.\n\nThe reason there are spectators cheering me in, is that the organisers all had to wait to make sure everyone had come back safely from the mountain. I had been out there for so long on my own people had started to gather to look out for me wondering where I was. The crowd wasn’t so much waiting to congratulate me, but about to set off on a search party before it got dark! As for my joyful expression. It is true, I am euphoric, but it isn’t the face of someone shouting in victory, it is me grinning furiously in pure unadulterated relief. I hadn’t died out there, but against the odds, made it home safely! I love the photo because I find it hilarious. If I framed it and had it on my wall and said nothing, visitors to my home would ‘assume’ I must have been the best runner on the day. It would be my choice as to whether or not I corrected them, and explained I was actually the worst… and by a very long day. It isn’t a flattering photo, but objectively it is a good one, so much action, so much emotion and such a sense of occasion. I like it best when I don’t think about the picture as being of me as such, but a memory, and a story captured in perpetuity!"

    "Answer": "Well, if I have to pick a really good photo that someone took for me I would select a black and white photo that my grandfather took for me when I was only 5 years old. This is one of the best pictures that reminds me of my childhood and that is why it has a different appeal to me.\n\nAs I recall, this photo was taken by my grandfather with a camera he newly bought. It was my first day at school and my mother made me ready for the school early in the morning and I was all dressed up. I went to my grandfather’s room to ask for his blessing and he gave me a new fountain pen and a storybook. He then took me to the garden and took this photo. It would be probably 1990 and it must have been the winter season. It is such a special event for me that I still remember it vividly.\n\nHe told me to stand still and then smile while he would take the photo. This was a very new experience for me. After I saw this picture I noticed that I was smiling in the photo and a part of the garden was visible in it. This is still a very important possession for me. My grandfather is no longer with us and this photo reminds me of his memory and my childhood. This picture represents my early childhood and the very thought of my sweet memory of my grandfather and childhood is something I cherish. For this reason, this is one of the most beautiful photos for me. I still have this picture and recently I have it reworked by a professional photo editor. With the time this picture got degraded and the restoration work was excellent. I have scanned the picture and saved the digital version of it on my computer."

    "Answer": "Photography is an art but everyone cannot be the artist. It requires a specific set of skills. I can remember the photo that was taken by Jim at their residence and I still consider the photo as a very good one.\n\nI cannot remember exactly how old I was at that time – might be 14 or 15, when I went to uncle Robert’s place. He was my maternal uncle living in the same city with us in Texas. Jim, my cousin was interested in photography at that time. He clicked the photo for us where I posed with mom and uncle Robert. Jim took the photo with an old-fashioned camera that had some sort of negative rolls insides to capture the moments. However, Jim printed out the picture and it looked excellent.  \n\nJim took the photo. He had received a camera as a present on his 17th birthday. In fact, it was his passion to take photos of people. He also bought a book about photography. Reading the book, he learned to take photos and actually he was improving at a good speed. But he had to spend time and money on his passion. So, when he asked me and mom to pose for a photo, my mom wanted to see how much he has improved. She proposed uncle Robert to pose with us. We all posed and Jim took the photo. He took a perfect shot and before he clicked, he asked us to stand in some different positions. We followed his advice and he took the shot.\n\nThis is a nice photo. A matured and a young lady is posing with a middle-aged man inside the frame. The backdrop of the photos also depicts a quiet and natural environment. In fact, the photo was taken on the lawn of the uncle’s house. Besides, the locality was not that much developed then. So, a large area was covered with trees and small buildings that brought a nice look. Jim asked us to pose with them so that he could get a good frame and objects. After all, he was the photographer, so we obeyed him. When he clicked the photo, he was smiling and told that this was one of his best shots.\n\nI like the photo very much as it reminds me of many events. We stayed at the house of uncle Robert and had lots of fun. Jim is a grown-up man and a father of two kids while I have also my own family. I was a young shy girl then but now a talkative lady. Mom is still alive but uncle Robert died a couple of years ago. The photo has several copies. I have one at my study while Jim has a copy that he has hung in his living room with other best pictures he captured. When the photo was clicked, I was unable to understand photography but now I realise the Jim was right. It was one of his best shots ever. The frame, the composition, backgrounds etc. could not have been better than this. Hence, I love this photo very much."

    "Answer": "I have never really been much of a fan of foreign movies, partly because I can’t completely immerse myself in them due to the language barrier. But, when I watched “Das Boot” (The Boat) about 10 years ago, I had to change my mind about watching foreign films.\n\n“Das Boot” is a German film which I watched as a university student about 10 years ago when our university library played a series of famous foreign films there as a part of an effort to introduce foreign and popular cultures to its students. Some of my friends asked me to watch some of those foreign films, but I told them that watching them would be just a waste of time for me since I wouldn’t really enjoy them because of the language barrier. However, when they told me about “Das Boot”, a movie which was based on a true story from World War II, I decided to give it a go. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish.\n\nAnyway, Das Boot, originally released in 1981, is a German war movie which was written and directed by Wolfgang Petersen. Based on the “breath-stopping” events of the second world war, the film talks about the activities and incidents of German submarine  \"U-96\" and its crew, as they set out on a hazardous patrol in the Battle of the Atlantic. It depicts both the excitement of battle and the tedium of the fruitless hunt, and shows the men serving aboard U-boats as ordinary individuals with a desire to do their best for their comrades and their country. In this masterpiece movie, the main actors were Jurgen Prochnow, Herbert Grönemeyer, Klaus Wennemann, Klaus  Wennemann, Hubertus Bengsch, Martin Semmelrogge and many others.\n\nWell, I enjoyed this movie so much, mainly because it very realistically portrays the day-to-day struggles of the soldiers to maintain their motivation for war, instead of actually “shooting” and “destroying” everything on their path, which can always be seen in other war movies. Moreover, it told an excellent story and the acting was superb. So I loved it so much."

    "Answer": "Well, whenever I think of a foreign film that I enjoyed so much the name ‘Life Is Beautiful’ pops in my mind. It is an Italian tragicomic comedy-drama film that was released in 1997. I watched this film in 2002 and this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.\n\nThis film was directed by Roberto Benigni who also starred this film as the protagonist.  This film was about a Jewish Italian book shop owner who used his creative imagination to shield his son from the terror of internment in a Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War.\n\nIn the film, Roberto Benigni acts as Guido. He is a humorous, talented and sharp person who comes to the city to start a new life. He has a natural talent to make the best out of each situation he encounters and he falls in love with a girl. Eventually, they get married and have a son. The film depicts the changing political climate in Italy and then shows that Guido, his wife and their son were taken to the Nazi concentration camp. As a loving father, Guido hides their true situation from his son and makes him believe that the camp is a complex gaming competition and they must win. The boy is totally convinced that the camp is indeed a gaming competition because of his innocence and his father’s brilliant performance. At the end of the movie, the US force approaches the camp and rescue the captives and the boy was still convinced that he won the competition. His father is shot by a German soldier and till his death, he performs a character to reassure his son that he will be the winner and would win the prize.\n\nAs I said Roberto Benigni was the main character of this film. Among other actors and actresses, Nicoletta Braschi acted as Dora and Giorgio Cantarini was the boy, Giosuè. I saw this film three times. I first enjoyed it with my parents when I was only 17. Later on, I watched in a Cineplex in our city and recently I watched it on my computer.\n\nThis is considered as one of the best film ever produced and the plot of the story was so astounding that everybody loves it. It depicts the horrors of wars, love or a father, how we can confront our worse time and how can we become a winner even when we are forced to be losers. The storyline, acting, compelling plot and overall presentation of the movie were so great that I picked it as one of the best 10 movies I have ever seen in my life."

    "Answer": "I love watching movies, especially movies with a foreign language. Recently I have enjoyed a movie named – The Return. This is a Russian movie with English subtitle and a marvel to me. Now I am going to describe the movie in brief.   \n\nThe Return is based on a mystic theme. The movie tells the story of a father and his two kids. The father left the family and returned home after around 12 years. But he did not explain his absence but it is guessed that he was in the military and went for participating in a war in another state. He takes his sons on an adventure where he wanted to guide them to be a man. But the disobedience of one of the sons created a conflict with the father. Finally, the father died by falling from the observation tower where the disobedient son climbed up and threatened to jump. The movie plot touched me greatly.  \n\nThe movie has four main casts and they are Andrei, Ivan, the mother and the father. The role of Andrei is played by Vladimir Garin, the role of Ivan is played by Ivan Dobronravov, Konstantin Lavronenko played the role of the Father while Natalia Vdovina carried the role of Mother. All of the artists have performed their bests. The movie belonged to the drama genre, and accordingly, it was able to create a complete dramatic sense among the audience. Due to the extensive performance of the artists, the movie achieved a notable number of awards by different platforms. The most notable awards for the movie include – BBC Four World Cinema Award, European Film Awards, Golden Globe Awards etc. Besides, it was the debut for the director as well and he has made a great entrance with this film.      \n\nUsually, November is the month for me that brings a sense of complete relaxation. I take breaks from my study. Importantly the university I study in Budapest remains busy round the year but due to my course, I get some leisure weeks in the last quarter of the year. So, I utilise the moments perfectly either by visiting my relatives or by reading books and watching movies. This year I decided to enjoy some foreign-language movies and selected ‘The Return’ for watching. Usually, I watch movies with my friends, but when it is a serious movie, I like to watch it alone. So, I watched ‘The Return’ at my home. I started watching the movie late at night and continued until it ended.     \n\nGenerally, I do not watch all types of movies. I like to watch movies with a good plot. In fact, movies like action, comedy etc. have no appeal to me unless they have a special plot. So, I am a bit selective in watching movies. Before watching ‘The Return’, I read the reviews and ratings from different film reviewing sites. Then I decided to watch this movie. Though I am not familiar with the Russian language, the subtitles made it easier for me to comprehend the theme of the movie. For its plot nature and filmmaking techniques, I enjoyed the movie to the fullest extent."

    "Answer": "When I was a young high school student, I had some sort of hobby to make different kinds of handmade things to keep at home. But, I never really thought that anybody would really appreciate those works as it happened with one of my high school friends. It happened about 12 years ago from now. In fact, he didn’t stop at only appreciating my handmade things, but also asked me to make one for him.\n\nBut, the problem, of course, was that I just didn’t know what exactly would be a perfect gift for him. So, I asked my high school friend about his opinion on his idea of a perfect gift, but he wasn’t too sure either, even though he got a chance to check through all of my handmade objects. Then, suddenly I asked him if he had any fruit basket at his home, and if his answer was negative, I told him that I would be more than happy to make him a fruit basket. Not to mention, my high school friend liked my idea very much and asked me to go ahead with it.\n\nAnyway, in order to make that fruit basket, I collected some PVC pipes with a diameter of 0.75 radius inch and then cut them into pieces of one inch each. After that, I began to stick those pieces to each other in a round-shape bowl with the help of super glue. As soon as, all those small PVC pipe pieces, stuck with each other, it got the shape of a round shape bowl, which later would be called our “fruit basket”, I decided to render it a beautiful colour by spraying some magenta paint on it. Once the paint was dry, I gave the fruit basket to my friend.\n\nWell, I gave this handmade gift to my friend, partly because I wanted to be recognized for my works and efforts a little. After all, we all want to be famous at some point, don’t we? Besides, I gave the gift also because it would make my friend feel better as he wanted a hand-made gift from me."

    "Answer": "Thank you a lot for this topic. I will talk about a handmade gift that I gave to my younger sister when she was only 7 and how I actually made it.\n\nWell, the gift was a wooden doll (I must confess that doll did not look that great as I made it when I was only 15 years old and I had little skills making such things). Yet my sister loved it so much and I felt so proud for making this gift for her. It was a late winter evening probably in 2001 when I took my sister to the market to buy her a pair of shoes. On our way back home, she showed me a large doll displayed in a fancy toy shop. She told me that she would love to own a doll like that. She knew the price of that doll would be really high and I did not have enough money to actually buy her that doll.\n\nThis event made me sad a lot and I asked my father, who lived in a different city for his job to buy her a doll. He probably forgot about the doll and did not send any doll in the next two weeks. My sister’s birthday was approaching and I wanted to make her a beautiful doll before her birthday. I used to make boats, wooden pens, and other types of toys in my childhood as a passion but making a doll was something I never thought I would do someday. However, I dared to make one and worked for more than 7-8 days to finally make something that I could claim as a doll.\n\nI took a fine quality wood large enough to give it a shape of a doll, used other tools, glue and other ingredients to make this doll. I painted that doll and tried to mimic my sister’s facial features in this doll. When I gave this doll to my sister, she was so amazed that she kissed me and thanked me again and again. She even recognised that I tried to mimic her face in that doll. Then I told her that ‘the name of this doll is Emmy’. She laughed and told me that it was even more beautiful than her.\n\nA few weeks later my father bought her a very expensive and beautiful doll but my sister was somehow convinced that the one I made was prettier. Maybe that was because of her love and affection for me.\n\nI basically wanted to make my sister happy and to give her something before her 8th birthday. I did not have enough money to buy her a big doll and I had some skills in making toys with woods and papers. Considering all these facts I was convinced that I should make a wooden doll by myself for my sister."

    "Answer": "Receiving a birthday gift helps us to feel delighted and how we are cared for. Besides, this is really filled with enjoyment. When the gift is handmade, the happiness doubles. So, I presented a handmade leaf light to Camellia on her 21st birthday. She was extremely glad about the gift.\n\nI was wondering what can I present to Camellia on her birthday. In fact, it is really difficult to select the right gift for someone since there are some common gifts which are always presented by people. So, I tried to avoid the regular track and planned to offer her something handmade. So, I gave her the leaf lamp. It was an outstanding gift for her and she was immensely happy with the innovative gift. It was a simple leaf lamp. Actually, I try to make handmade things by reusing them. This is a great idea to make people amazed.  \n\nCamellia is my childhood friend. She and I have been continuing the friendship for the past 14 years. My parents shifted to Mexico about 15 years ago when I was a kid. They admitted me to the local elementary school where I studied for the next five years. I met Camellia Wellington at this school. She was studying there before my appearance. She was a native resident of the locality – her parents settled there even before her birth. However, we met in the school and the bond is still going on. Both of us are at the same university now with the same courses. So, the bondage between us is really awesome. Marking her 21st birthday, I gave her the gift. She invited me a couple of day before the birthday, but I started making the gift a week before the day.    \n\nThis was a bit difficult for me to prepare the leaf lamp. In fact, I watched the lamp on a DIY website (not citing the name of the website). But they did not have any clear instructions to make the leaf lamp. The website just showed that making a lamp would be an attractive handmade gift. So, I made it with my own attempt and effort. I took some plastic colourful bottles which are usually thrown away after use. I collected the bottles and cut them into leaf shapes. It was a time-consuming task to cut the plastic pieces into the shape. Some of the pieces were not in the exact size while some of the leaves were smaller. However, I glued them with a string and created a hollow in the mid of the leaves where I placed a bulb. When the bulb is plugged in, the light looks colourful.\n\nGenerally, people go to stores and get their gifts. There is nothing newer in this traditional way. Most of the cases, it appears that there are a couple of gifts of a similar category. So, I thought something different. Usually, I perform some DIY techniques for my home and dad likes it most. When I was planning for a suitable gift for Camellia, I thought the leaf lamp would be a nice one for her. So, I prepared the handmade gift to present her on her birthday."

    "Answer": "I never really complain about the traffic jam because I have accepted it as the daily reality of busy city life. But, the other day, about a few weeks ago, I did feel a bit jittery about the waiting time in a traffic jam which, I thought, could be avoided rather easily. Let me explain what exactly transpired on that day.\n\nIt was around 6:00 pm on Thursday late afternoon when I was driving on a busy road to reach home. The traffic on the road was nothing unusual as all the vehicles were moving at a fairly reasonable speed. So, there was no chance of any sudden mishaps or built-up of traffic jam on the road which could keep me waiting for about 30 minutes or so. At least, that’s what I thought, but soon I was proved wrong as, after driving only about 5 minutes, I suddenly noticed that the traffic was slowing down.\n\nLittle later, the traffics on the road stopped completely. Initially, I thought that it was going to be one of those “short stops” on the road, probably either because some nutcase driver couldn’t light his cigarette properly or forgot to check his car’s “water reservoir” before hitting the road. But, I, again, was proved wrong as soon I came to know that the traffic jam was caused by a big wood-log carrying truck which accidentally had dropped a few logs on the road. Luckily, of course, nobody was injured, but it was going to take at least about 30 minutes for the police to arrive and move the logs aside. So, I just decided to listen to some music and talk to some of my friends over the phone until the road was cleared.\n\nAnyway, I felt a bit frustrated, and perhaps also mad, because of the traffic jam. I also felt that the city authority perhaps could do a better job of keeping that busy road safe by preventing heavy trucks from using it during the rush hours."

    "Answer": "Well, traffic jam in our city is not unusual and the regular commuters often suffer from horrible congestion on roads. A recent study shows that around 20 hours of time is wasted for an average commuter each month in our city and that statistics depicts how heinous the traffic jam in our city is. While thinking about a time when I had to wait in a traffic jam, I could remember many such events and for this cue card topic, I will talk about a particular event when the traffic jam was so pathetic that I literally went mad!\n\nIt was about a year ago when I went to our national airport to see off a relative who would leave for the United Kingdom. On our way to the airport, the traffic was usual and we reached there in a taxi that took around 45 minutes. After I saw of this relative, I went to the nearby bus station to pick a public bus to return home. I got a bus within 15 minutes and in the next 10 minutes, the road traffic was good. All of a sudden the bus stopped at a traffic signal and it did not move for the next 20 minutes. People on the bus got anxious and they started talking about what happened. I got off from the bus to investigate what actually happened. I tried to talk to traffic police but he was so busy that I could not even grab his attention. I got back to the bus and I heard more bad news. Some passengers were talking about an accident and how that had created the deadlock on the route.\n\nI bought a newspaper and waited next 30 minutes very patiently and was expecting that things would get back to its normal condition soon. However, it did not and I heard that many students have blocked the road as one of their classmates died because of the accident. Police and those students had a hot debate and they were adamant to leave the road until the bus driver who caused the accident was arrested and punished. It was a situation that would not be resolved soon and that’s why many bus passengers left the bus to get back to their home. I had to reach home and I heard that the alternative road was also blocked. I was quite furious at that time but had nothing to do. My cell phone battery was beeping to indicate that it will be turned off anytime and the distance was more than 2 miles to reach home. I decided to walk and then again waited for a few more minutes. Thus two hours passed and at that time I left the bus to walk.\n\nThe walking experience was not that good. There were people everywhere and I felt stupid not to leave the bus earlier. I saw so many police officers and traffic police who were trying to handle the situation but I noticed things were getting even worse. Luckily I had no bag or anything to carry with me. Thus I walked for another 2 hours and finally I reached home quite exhausted and in awful condition."

    "Answer": "I think life in Mumbai would have been prettier if there were no traffic congestions. A couple of weeks ago, I had to experience a terrible traffic jam while I was returning home from my office. Now I will narrate the event in brief.\n\nI have joined as a junior executive at a multinational corporation in this year. The office is located in the central part of Mumbai. But my residence is at a corner of the city. Usually, it takes nearly 45 minutes to reach my office from my home and I can return home from the office within an hour. But on that day I experienced horrible traffic congestion on Bhuleshwar street. The street is one of the busiest one in the city but the jam was unusual on the day.  \n\nI got stuck in the jam for over three hours. In fact, I had nothing to do to avoid the jam. I do not own any private car or motorbike. So I use public transports to move to places I need. Accordingly, I rode on a bus that will drop me at the stoppage which is a few minutes’ walk from my home. Besides, the journey was comfortable for me – there was no rush inside the bus. But when the bus arrived at the Bhuleshwar street, it did not move. The other vehicles on the street were halted as well. Anyone could not inform us what had happened with the street. Actually, the street remains busy after 6:00 pm but I was late to get out of the office. I rode the bus at 7.20 pm. So, I expected to reach within a short time.       \n\nLuckily, I had my office laptop with me and it was charged fully. So, I did not have to worry about power for the machine. My boss assigned me with a presentation, in fact, he told me to make a draft. But since the issue was too complicated and I was ordained to submit him on the next day, I use the time to bring the idea. I developed a simple idea for expanding the market for a certain product and made the PowerPoint presentation right on the bus. But I could not send the presentation as I kept the internet modem at the office. So, I waited for the next day to show it to my boss. In fact, it was a blessing for me in the guise of a disaster.   \n\nInitially, I felt bored with the horrific traffic congestion. I planned to reach home early so that I could think over the issues and prepare the presentation. It was the top urgent assignment for me. Simultaneously, I had some other important tasks to complete – attending a birthday party was one of them. A friend of mine asked me to attend the party as he was shifting in the USA. So, he wanted all of his friends to be present there. I thought that neither I could complete the assignment nor I could attend the party. Suddenly, the idea of completing the presentation crossed my mind and I completed that on the bus. After reaching home, I changed my dress and started at the birthday party. It was fun to be there. So, the night was not bad at all though initially, the traffic jam appeared to destroy everything for me."

    "Answer": "I have waited on many occasions. In fact, I have accepted the act of “waiting” to be a part of our normal life which we just can’t avoid, just as I couldn’t avoid it when I needed my car mechanic to fix my car at my home.\n\nIt happened about a few months back when suddenly, one day, my car engine wasn’t starting. The same kind of problem happened with my car in the past, but after trying a few tricks, the problem usually went away. But, on that occasion, doing those things didn’t really help my car start. So, I had no other choices but to call my trusted car mechanic, who has been fixing my car since last 5 years or so, hoping that he would be able to offer me some kind of solution over the phone. But, unfortunately, he told me that he would actually need to come to my home to check my car before he could fix it. He also told me that he would arrive at my place in 30 minutes.\n\nBut, my mechanic didn’t show up after 30 minutes, even though, that 30 minutes seemed like 2 hours since I was a bit worried about the condition of my old car. I called the shop of my mechanic, but his assistant told me that he had left the shop about 30 minutes ago.  So, I kept waiting again, but the longer I was waiting, the more nervous I was getting about my car because I thought that my car had some major problems. However, my mechanic did finally arrive but not before keeping me waiting for almost two and a half hours.\n\nAnyway, I needed to wait for this person because he needed to pick up his sister from the airport, which he completely forgot about because of his rather busy work schedule. I was a bit frustrated because of the waiting, I did, but I also told myself that we are only humans, and so we could make mistakes without any notice in advance."

    "Answer": "I must confess that waiting for someone for a long is something I am never fond of, particularly if this person is supposed to arrive at a time that we both agreed upon. This topic reminds me of a time when I had to wait for my best buddy, John, at a park nearby my home and he showed up at least two hours late than he was supposed to.\n\nIt was about a year ago when John invited me to visit his hometown during our semester break. I convinced my parents that I will go to John’s hometown for only a couple of days just to refresh myself and to enjoy the beauty of a suburban area. However, we fixed a date and in the morning John called me that he will pick me from the park and I should reach there within 30 minutes. I left home after 20 minutes and thought John would come any time to pick me up. The horrible waiting experience then started and as I remember I had to wait at least 2 hours till John finally arrived.\n\nI had no idea that John would arrive so late and I could not reach him on his cell phone though I tried several times. At a time I started worrying that John must have been in some kind of problems and I thought to return home. However, something inside me told that John would not abandon the tour without any valid reason and he must have been in some kind of emergency. The waiting time somehow seems longer than usual and waiting for two hours seemed so long to me. I felt anxious for the first 30 minutes and then started worrying about John. At a time I started feeling stupid for leaving before John reached. I even felt angry and thought to cancel the tour. So I would say my experience was not good while I was waiting for him.\n\nHowever, when John arrived and explained that he had to run to a hospital where his uncle got admitted all of a sudden and could not contact me due to the mobile network, I felt calm and considered the reason a valid one for the delay."

    "Answer": "The celebration of an event is a matter of great excitement but waiting is really intolerable amid such occasions. Theory of Relativity starts influencing the time. In fact, it happened with me last Monday on the 16th birthday of my younger sister.\n\nI live with my family in Alberta, Canada. I am a college student while I have two more siblings – David, five years senior to me and a computer programmer at a multinational IT agency located in Alberta, and Susana, the youngest member of the family. Susana just turned 16. To make the birthday remarkable, I arranged for a party in the association of mom and dad. The house was decorated nicely and mom made the finest cake of her life marking the day. But we all lamented for David. But David was unable to join us at the right time for his office engagement.\n\nSusana crossed 15 and stepped into 16 on November 21. It was a great day for her. Considering her age, I planned for an exceptional birthday party at home. My parents invited some of our relatives residing in the same locality while Susana asked some of her friends to attend the party. In fact, without the near and dear ones, it is impossible to have a great birthday party. Unluckily, we missed David so much on this day. He told on the telephone that just before leaving the office, he was shouldered an assignment which may make him late. He suggested continuing the party. But we were worried at home about David if he could join us in time.\n\nThe party was set to begin at 7 sharp and the guests started to arrive since 6.30. Susana did not start the party and asked everyone to be patient for a few more minutes. So, we waited for one and a half hours more for David. Moreover, the invited guests lived nearby, and hence they also agreed to wait for him. After all, he is the elder brother of the birthday girl. Finally, David informed me that he was unable to come even by 10 pm. Considering the issue, we had to start the party at 8.30. Everyone present there started missing my elder- David as he was fond of such family events. He actually never missed such events before but now his professional involvement has made the trouble.\n\nWaiting is indeed a hefty task. But sometimes we are to wait for some undeniable reasons. I waited for David as he is my elder brother and a part of my family. Similarly, the other invited guests and especially Susana waited for him as he is a loveable person. He knows very well how to make people smile. His smart answers and ideas amaze us all. But unfortunately, he missed the event. He was sorry about that. On the other sides, we also missed him much. Susana could not enjoy the party to the fullest extent as David was absent there. The absence of David reminded all how dearer he actually is to us all."

    "Answer": "I can’t really recall many occasions when I needed to borrow something from anybody. But, during my high school years, I needed to borrow something on a couple of occasions, and today, I would like to talk about one of those occasions here.\n\nIt was about more than 10 years ago when I still was a high school student. Back then, I just loved to play football/soccer. But, as far as my parents were concerned, they didn’t really like me becoming so much interested in playing football. In fact, they rather wanted me to focus solely on my school studies. Therefore, it was only quite natural that they wouldn’t offer me enough financial support when it had come to buying any kind of football jerseys or boots.\n\nOf course, I didn’t mind this lack of financial support that much since I could always save up some money from my daily tiffin allowances in order to carry on playing football as a member of my high school football team.\n\nAnyway, everything was going fine until suddenly, one day, I noticed that my boots looked too old and worn out. In fact, they looked so worn out that I felt that they wouldn’t last the next two matches. But, on the other hands, I desperately wanted to play those two matches since the matches were against two high profile teams of our district. Seeing no other alternative, I decided to talk to a senior brother from my high school and borrow his boots. Luckily, he understood my situation, as well as the passion I had for football, and decided to give his boots to me for a week.\n\nI borrowed the boots from that senior brother from my high school, mainly because using my old and worn out boots would jeopardize the safety of my legs. I wanted to borrow it also because it would help me perform better in the field and win the matches."

    "Answer": "Well, I can think of many occasions when I had to borrow important things from others and for this cue card topic, I will talk about such an occasion when I borrowed a pen from an unknown person when I was in a bank.\n\nI had to borrow a pen to correct the amount I wrote on a cheque leaf and to add a new signature below it. This was an ordinary gel pen that I bowed from a person who was also in the bank to withdraw money. I can’t recall his name but he was standing just behind me at the cashier counter.\n\nIt was probably 6 or 7 months ago when I went to my bank to withdraw some money. I wrote the cheque and signed it from home and went to the bank to withdraw the amount. I waited about 20 minutes in the queue and when I handed over the cheque to the cashier, she informed me that my current balance does not cover the amount I have written on the cheque and my savings account does not permit over-limit. She requested me to rewrite and figure so that she can give me the allowed amount. After she returned the cheque leave which I was supposed to correct, I found that I totally forgot to bring a pen. I asked the cashier if she had a spare pen and she told me that she had lent a pen to a customer and could not find it. I was quite embarrassed and had no other option but to ask the person for a pen who was standing behind me. He smiled and borrowed me a pen that I used to correct the cheque. After I finished with the correction, I thanked that person and showed my gratitude for lending me the pen. I asked his name and it was probably Richard or Ricardo, which I am not quite sure now.\n\nBorrowing something in desperate moments is something we cannot avoid and I think there are several occasions when I had to do it. The particular even I talked about is a moment I needed the pen and had no other way than to borrow it from someone."

    "Answer": "Enjoying a walk in the Grand Canyon National Park was a dream for me and I made the dream come true last month. But I had to borrow a car from Robin, my best college buddy. Since he was unable to go, he allowed me using his car.\n\nI am an undergrad student at the University of Arizona. Before moving to the university in Arizona this year, I used to live in Arkansas with my parents and other family members. So, I did not have the chance to visit the Grand Canyon National Park before. Besides, being an undergrad, I have to handle extreme academic pressure. Considering all the issues, I was unable to manage time. Finally, everything was set but I needed a car. Robin Campbell borrowed his car to me to make the trip.\n\nActually, the academic pressure in the university goes round the year but it is a bit tolerable in the last quarter of the year (October - December). So, I made the plan to visit the Grand Canyon National Park and will stay there for a day. Accordingly, I made the plan, gathered some partners and arranged everything except a car. I could not realise before that this is an issue to be considered. In such a situation, my buddy came forward to borrow his own car. In fact, he had bought this 2016 FORD Explorer a few months ago for travelling out of the city but could not use the car for academic engagement. So, he allowed using the car but under certain strict conditions.\n\nRobin Campbell is one of my best buddies in the university. He lives in downtown with his parents. He loves surfing and taking part in outdoor activities and most importantly travelling. Both of us had made lots of planning to move here and there in the state but hardly could manage time for the short trips. Robin wanted to move to the Grand Canyon for a couple of days, in fact, he wanted to have some camping on the spot. But the others did not agree to stay at night under the open sky. Then it was decided that we will start early in the morning and come back by evening. Robin will drive the car and we will be his passengers.\n\nI had to borrow the car for some specific reasons. Firstly, I did not plan for the car in my original planning for the trip. Secondly, I have my own Fiat and have left that at Arkansas for my sister’s use. Besides, moving inside the park without a car is almost impossible. Using public transport may help us reaching near the park, but we need our own vehicles to move into this huge area. Robin suddenly felt some abdominal disorders on the trip day. So, he was unable to drive and actually he was not ready for the trip at all. His physical condition made him unfit for the day. So, considering all the issues, I asked him to borrow the car and he willingly did. It was a memorable trip for us all indeed."

    "Answer": "Thank you for this great cue card topic. I think that everybody wants to have his or her home in a beautiful place, and I am no exception.\n\nAnyway, the beautiful place, where I would prefer my home to be, is called “Nelson”. Nelson is a small city in New Zealand but it is certainly one of the most spectacularly stunning cities in the world. In fact, I have fallen in love with this beautiful city after visiting it for the first time about a few years ago.\n\nPrior to visiting this gorgeous city, of course, I had already learned a great deal about it by reading different kinds of magazines on travel and leisure, as well as by watching international travel news on TV, but learning about the place from reading magazines or watching TV was not even remotely as exciting as visiting the place.\n\nTalking about my home, I want to have a moderately large home so that I won’t really have to struggle to maintain it. It would have 4 rooms, with a large kitchen and a large living room. While I want my home to have all kinds of modern amenities, I also want to have some touch of nature in it by having some vines and climbing plants on the walls of my living room. I also want to have varieties of flowers in all the balconies. Besides, the windows of my rooms will be large so that enough sunshine and air can enter my home as often as possible.\n\nAnyway, I would choose to live in this place because it is a smaller city, but this gives it that familiar small-town feel. It is sunny year-round, with some of the best weather in New Zealand, so I won’t really have to worry about the cold weather. The landscape is just as spectacular as the weather, which allows for plenty of outdoors opportunities. Besides, the fact that the town is surrounded by lakes, mountains, rivers and beaches, also makes it a perfect place for living."

    "Answer": "This is a nice topic to talk about. I have been dreaming for a long to have a home of my own, where I will have absolute freedom to live in and the place would be a nice one, close to nature. Moreover, the home decoration would be according to my choice and everything would be picked by me.\n\nWell, this dream house would be near the hill which is around 2 kilometres away from my current living place. This hill is one of the most beautiful places in our hometown and I would pick this place to build my dream home. There are numerous hills and tea gardens in this locality and I would specifically choose a tall hill where I would be able to build a small home with pine woods. The flat top of the hills would allow me to build a home and a large portion of this place would be used for gardening and farming.\n\nI know this place from my childhood. This is a naturally beautiful place where I went for the first time with my family for a picnic. I was around 12 years old at that time. We had our lunch in the hilltop area where 3-4 farmer families used to live. The idea of having a home there was formed in my mind at that time. I have visited this place several times later on and the serenity and beauty of hills, river, tea gardens and simple lifestyles of the inhabitants appealed me a lot each time.\n\nI would build a wooden home that would have 4 rooms. One for my bedroom, one for guests, the third one would be my study room and the largest one would be the one where I will work. This would be a simple hut type home with large front garden and farming lands. I will pick the wooden furniture and obviously everything I will need to live a decent and hassle-free life.\n\nThere are many reasons I would love to live there. First, the beauty of nature: the surrounding view, the flowing narrow river, tea gardens, green picturesque scenery and sound of nature would be the perfect elements to live in peacefully. I think this would allow me to stay away from a chaotic urban lifestyle and to stay surrounded by Nature. Secondly, this would allow me to finish a book I have started writing which is still in its initial stage. I would have plenty of time to appreciate the life and meaning of being alive. The urban life surrounds us with so many problems and complexities that I sometimes feel severely stressed about. I would take this excellent opportunity to revive my spirit and self-satisfaction."

The place is enriched with a natural beach, scenic views, mountains, and most importantly modern amenities I need for a healthy living. Besides, the economic conditions of the locality are also stable and plenty of options for outdoor recreations have made it the most attractive place for me to make a home. Weather is another concerning issue for me and Santa Barbara is perfect in that term.      \n\nSanta Barbara is one of the renowned places in the USA and a popular tourist destination. The region is often highlighted in different newspapers, magazines and television programs. Besides, I have also visited the place many times. Since then, I have cherished the dream to make a home here to enjoy the natural beauty for the lifetime. Some call it a small city with very big thoughts. The city has been expanded and a good number of permanent residents are now leading their peaceful life. Some of the residents came for work or educational purposes and never left. In fact, Santa Barbara is one of the most beautiful cities and also considered as one of the top 100 places to live in the USA.     \n\nI want a well-designed and nicely decorated small home. Often there are restrictions even in larger homes for faulty designed. So, I will select a creative and suitable design for my home in Santa Barbara. The ceiling height should be 10 feet instead of regular eight feet height. It would also come with larger windows so that I could enjoy the daylight and simultaneously see the Santa Ynez Mountain Range and the coastline from my room. I also want a lawn before my home where I will grow the local vegetables, fruits and flowers. The porch will be in front of my main entrance which will make the home look bigger than actually, it is. I plan to make a green and energy-efficient home. No air-conditioning or heating system will be allowed. Moreover, the kitchen will be extended instead of a dining room.\n\nSanta Barbara is a beautiful place to live in for natural features. History of the locality dates back to the 18th century. The residents are satisfied with both the natural and modern amenities they enjoy here. Santa Barbara has its own cultural festivals and events. I like the fresh farm to table foods which forms better health. The adjacent ocean with enriched marine resources has made it splendid. The foods available in the restaurants are also attractive for tourists and city locals. Besides, walking inside the city also appeals to me. The commercial areas, coffee shops, groceries etc. all are well decorated and provides a nice view. All these matters have made living in the Santa Barbara city exceptional. So, I want to make my home in this city."

    "Answer": "I am one of those rather passive people who don’t really live to have any kind of arguments with anybody except on some very rare occasions. Today, I would like to talk about one of those rare occasions when I had a strong disagreement with a good friend of mine.\n\nAnyway, this good friend of mine, I am talking about, is an otherwise decent person, but, he had a habit of talking negatively about other peoples’ religious beliefs. Of course, I have tried to indirectly ask him not to do so on many occasions before, but he didn’t really seem to care too much about what I had to say or how I felt about this rather awkward aspect of his personality.\n\nBut, the other day, when we are enjoying some fresh coffee at a coffee shop, I just couldn’t keep my cool anymore as I found him to be doing the same thing amid a number of other people. I politely tried to alert him about how our conversation was making other people around us uncomfortable, but, as usual, he didn’t really seem to care. And, it was at that time that I told him very strongly that his religion bashing was totally wrong and unacceptable. Of course, he tried to argue that he was only trying to point out the inconsistencies within the religions of other people, but I told him that what he was doing was actually hurting the feeling of other people. He still wasn’t convinced that he was wrong. Finally, I told him that if he didn’t give up his religion bashing habit, I would have to terminate our friendship, and it was at that time that he stopped.\n\nAnyway, after the disagreement and finishing our coffee, I asked him in a very friendly manner about what he would do if someone else was bashing or questioning his religious belief. I think that he perfectly understood my point and as a result, never talked negatively about the religious beliefs of other people again, thereafter."

    "Answer": "I usually go well with all of my friends and I have a tendency to listen first and then react. However, this is always not the case and I can recall some events when I had to strongly disagree with my close friends. I will talk about such an event when I had a strong disagreement with Paula, who is one of my very best friends, how it happened, how we solved this dispute and then the result of this disagreement.\n\nI was in my early university days when this disagreement took place. Our course teacher gave us an assignment and it was about writing a review on a foreign movie. That was the part of our mid-semester assignment and the teacher could absolutely pick any topic as an assignment for the students. I was placed on a team of 4 members and Paula was also on our team. She was one of the top-performing students in our class and well-known for her enviable results.\n\nWe had only 4 days to submit our assignment and after the class, we agreed that we will watch this movie at Richard’s place (another team member for the assignment). Strangely Paula did not show up in the evening and her cell phone was turned off. We were worried about her and rescheduled to watch the movie on a later date. Next day I met Paula at the university campus and asked her if everything was okay. She looked surprised and said ‘oh, yes’, everything is absolutely fine.’ She also asked how was the movie and that shocked me. I then realised she did not come last evening intentionally. I told her that we had rescheduled the movie watching and this time she must appear at Richard’s place.  She laughed mockingly and told me to cancel it and write the review from the movie review websites. She also suggested that she is going to write the review for us and we could focus on something else.  That’s something I could not agree with and had to strongly disagree with her.\n\nI tried to convince her that the whole concept of the assignment was not to copy-paste contents from any website and that’s something I am not going to accept anyway. We had a hot debate for about 20 minutes and at the end of our loud conversation, we both became annoyed with each other. I finally told him that I will not be with her for this assignment and would report the teacher to assign me to a different team.\n\nUmm, after two days two other team members interfered and they proposed a solution that both of us (Paula and I) will write our own assignment and review while they will decide which one is better and that one would be submitted as the team assignment.\n\nHowever strong the disagreement was, our friendship was stronger and Paula yield to follow my lead to finish this assignment. That’s how the dispute, (or our disagreement) was resolved and we were all happy about that. Honestly speaking, the disagreement was so strong and at a time I thought that’s going to harm our friendship. But in reality, Paula was a smart and understanding woman and she accepted my proposal to resolve this issue. After we got A+ for our assignment, we were all happy and contented."

    "Answer": "Currently, smartphones offer different features while manufacturers try honing devices than before. Despite improved features, some of the brands have a poor power backup and I had a strong disagreement with a friend on this topic.\n\nI am an Apple product user and satisfied with the power backup of Apple smartphones. On the contrary, my friend was a Samsung user, and he was having troubles with power issues. His battery drained too fast which was unusual for a smartphone brand like Samsung. In fact, Samsung smartphones are unable to provide a steady level of power backup for users. After using the phone for a few moments, the power runs out strangely. He asked for a solution to the problem if I had any. I suggested him to change the handset as most of the smartphones from Samsung suffer the same issue. The disagreement begins.\n\nRid Cohen is one of my closest buddies in College. He lives adjacent to my residence and in fact, it is just a few minutes’ walks from my home. He feels comfortable with Samsung devices but equally, he alleges the disadvantages of using Samsung products. However, I am not blind to a relationship and bold enough to avoid double standards. So, I tried making Cohen believe that there are really some troubles with the batteries of Samsung smartphones. But he denied the allegation and placed poor logics favouring his phone. He said that the battery drains when a user uses many applications, but I believe using applications are what is smartphones are meant to. But the similar thing happens to me as well but I am not worried about the power issue of my iPhone 7. I use WiFi, play games, chat on social sites, make voice calls and much more. But the phone runs quite well and I plug it for charge thrice in a week.    \n\nIt was really difficult for me to resolve the disagreement. Actually, the disagreement went on for about 20 minutes. Both of us developed logics favouring our respective smartphones. But at a point, Cohen had to admit that his device really had some troubles. I pointed out each of the matters that I experienced when I was a Samsung mobile phone user. I told him that the phone heats up when it is used for making voice calls and playing games. He agreed. But he tried defending the facts saying that the battery heats up when it runs. I showed him my iPhone and asked to use it for the next 20 minutes. He did and there were no such issues like heating up or battery drain. Finally, Cohen acknowledged my reasons.\n\nBreaking a relationship is easier than building it. In some points, both of us went extreme. In fact, Cohen started shouting at me with the issues I criticised. Actually, Cohen wanted to be right for the wrong reason. But I let not that happen as there were several pieces of evidence to prove him wrong. I tried best to uphold his honour but at some points, he dishonoured himself placing some lame explanations. I had to be rude then. When the disagreement was over, he apologized to me for his unwanted interactions. But it was okay for both of us. We hugged and shook hands. Finally, Cohen was convinced to replace his smartphone and I am glad that he would have a nice smartphone using experience."

    "Answer": "To me, being able to speak or communicate in a foreign language is a very intriguing subject. Anyway, I happen to know only one more foreign language, in addition to English, and today, I would like to share my experience of using this language for the first time.\n\nThe foreign language, I am talking about, is the Japanese which I used to learn as a young university student about 7 years ago. The reason, of course, behind learning this language was that I wished to go to Japan after finishing my graduation and get higher education. But, then I had to change my plan because my parents just didn’t agree with it. So, with that change of plan, my motivation for learning the Japanese language also got diminished. But little did I know back then that one day, I would need to speak in this very language in my own home town!\n\nWell, to tell exactly what had really happened, I saw a few Japanese tourists doing some grocery shopping at a supermarket where I also was present. At one point, one of them approached me and asked me if he could use my phone to call his friends, staying at the same hotel with them. Suddenly, I asked them if they were Japanese in their own language. In response, he seemed so excited, apparently because I was talking in the Japanese language. I also got excited and told him to use my phone as long as he needed in the Japanese language. The conversation was brief, but I remember it to this date.\n\nWell, I felt very excited and emotional when I got the chance to use the Japanese language for the first time. In fact, I thought that all of those valuable efforts and time of mine, after all, in learning that foreign language didn’t go in vain. However, I also regretted the fact at the same time that I didn’t learn the language even more so that I could feel more confident about my Japanese language skills."

    "Answer": "Oh my, I have a feeling this is going to be a slightly embarrassing anecdote, but we all have to start somewhere experimenting with using another language ‘for real’ for the first time! Even though I blush at the memory, on balance it was also a lesson in how most people are a lot more forgiving than you might think, as long as you ‘show willing’ and at least make an effort to communicate in a friendly and sincere way!\n\nSo, I’ll tell you when it was, who I was speaking with (though it might be overstating things a bit to say it was a conversation), what the language was and how I felt about the interaction.\n\nSo, the situation was that I went to Vietnam to work as an English Teacher. I’m ashamed to say that even though I was going to help students improve their use of English as a foreign language, I myself am really terrible at learning and speaking other languages. I hope that this fact might make me more sympathetic to my students. I really do understand how hard it is to learn an unfamiliar vocabulary that sounds strange and even feels peculiar as you try to form the words in your mouth and move your tongue in odd contortions to create new sounds. This adventure was over a year ago now, but I remember it all very clearly. Anyway, I went to Vietnam speaking absolutely none of the language at all. I did have a guidebook, and tried to learn some ‘useful phrases’ in advance using that. However, I found out very quickly that learning Vietnamese was considerably more challenging than I’d anticipated – and that’s saying something, as I was quite fearful of the challenge before I went. The problem for me, is that Vietnamese is a tonal language, and as my first language is English (which isn’t)  I just didn’t have an ear sensitive enough to pick up the difference between how what seemed to me to be essentially the same word, might be uttered in 6 different ways to convey 6 distinctly different meanings. It was all very alien. However, where I was working very few people spoke any English, and I felt it was very rude of me not to make an effort to communicate in Vietnamese, however poorly.  My arrival coincided with Vietnamese New Year, and I did learn to shout out with enthusiasm a poorly pronounced version of ‘chúc mừng năm mới’ as I interacted with local people around that time. I fear my expression was rather ugly and inexact, but the context helped – it was pretty obvious what I was trying to say, and this, coupled with the festive atmosphere meant if I uttered it then usually I got a friendly wave and response in kind. \n\nWhere I was living, there weren’t any real cooking facilities, so I had to go out to eat all the time at local places. I am vegetarian, which was more uncommon than I expected in this part of Vietnam, so I set myself the task of learning to order a basic vegetarian noodle dish and an accompanying mango smoothie (because they were completely delicious and you can’t get anything like that in my county); along with a white iced coffee. I wanted to do so with courtesy and say ‘hello’ and ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to the staff at whatever eatery I ended up in. A kind colleague where I was working helped me by telling me what the phrases were, and how to pronounce them correctly. I’m not sure I could, to be honest, but I wrote the words down carefully in a way that I hoped would mean I’d be able to read them out later. If I took my time, I thought I might be able to approximate the correct pronunciation and so I could be understood. So it was, one day I took myself off to a new restaurant, and carefully used my prepared speech to order a meal. The Vietnamese waitress was absolutely lovely. I could tell she was struggling a bit to understand what I was saying, but after a few attempts, she laughed in recognition. She was really delighted that I ‘could speak Vietnamese’. Of course, I couldn’t really, but she told me (in very good English) that most overseas visitors didn’t make any effort at all to use her language, so terrible as my attempt was (my words not hers) she was happy to help and rewarded my efforts with a huge smile of appreciation. She was too polite to really correct my pronunciation, but in a way, it didn’t matter. We still managed to communicate, and I think it helped build up some rapport. I got the meal I wanted (including my delicious mango smoothie and iced coffee afterwards) and I felt like I’d made a significant breakthrough. I stuck out a bit in the community to be honest, as I was the only foreigner working in the area. This meant that all the local restaurants and street food stalls learned quite quickly what I liked to eat and order and probably brought it anyway without me having to really ask correctly. However, that isn’t the point. I do think it’s important to try and communicate in the native language of your host country. It also helped remind me how self-conscious my own students might feel in uttering unfamiliar English words publically, in front of me, a native speaker- although there was really no need, I would only ever applaud their efforts in trying. Trying to learn just a tiny bit of Vietnamese was quite humbling for me. I was just so bad at it!. In the many weeks, I was there, I don’t think I ever really progressed all that much, but I do have increased respect for anyone who can acquire even the most basic competence in another language let alone become fluent in communicating.\n\nSo how did I feel? Well, a bit self-conscious because I wasn’t very good, but I also felt pleased with myself for at least having tried. I And, I suppose in literal terms I succeeded too, as I did get the meal I wanted!  hope my efforts made me a better teacher, and perhaps a better guest in Vietnam too.\n\nThe ability to speak another language is an extraordinary gift and talent. For some lucky few, language acquisition comes easily, the rest of us have to put in a lot of hours and blood, sweat and tears to get to that point. However, the reward in being able to connect with other people and cultures from all over the world is priceless. I don’t think I’ll ever be fluent in Vietnamese, but I hope that whatever countries I may be lucky enough to visit in future I will always be brave enough to learn to say (and use) simple but important phrases like  ‘please’ and ‘thank you’… Having said that, though, it’s worth remembering that personally if in doubt I’ve always found nothing communicates more effectively than a wide smile, open body language and a willingness to laugh at yourself. Some things it seems are indeed the same the world over, a winning smile is surely one such thing!"

    "Answer": "Travelling is a great source of entertainment but most of the time I turn the fish out of the water while travelling to unknown places. Last month I went to Quebec in Canada. I had to use the French language to communicate which was uncomfortable for me.\n\nI am a college student in Canada and have just finished my first-year studies. From this regards, I am a Sophomore now. Before starting the second phase of the college, I planned a trip to Quebec. I had only three days to make the trip. So, I made it in the last three days of October. I went to see the most visited attractions in the state and enjoyed them. Besides, I took some pictures of the most beautiful and famous places. The foods were really attractive and I was glad about the serving process. But I struggled with the language.   \n\nIn fact, I am not a smart traveller. I made mistake always to get the things done right before the tour. So did I for this trip. I forgot that my host was French. Mr Austin was my host and a business mate of dad in Quebec. So, I did not book any hotels for staying there. He was a foreign businessman in Quebec and established himself as a reputed man there. But he felt uncomfortable to speak English. So, I was confused about communication with him. But uncle Austin was a man of great heart. He was a divorcee, lived alone in a large house. His daughter lives with his wife, in another state. His house is well decorated while his domestic help takes care of the home. So, he is free of troubles for caring for the large house. In fact, he is quite comfortable with this life.    \n\nBeing a French by birth, Mr Austin is unable to speak clearly and most of his pronunciations are incomprehensible to me. So, I decided to use the French language. Though I learnt the language in my school, I have forgotten most of the parts of the French language. So, it was a bit difficult for me to speak with my uncle Austin. Actually, my French language skills were not up to the mark and I just expressed my emotions with some selected words. He knew about everything going in the city and took me to the places I desired to go. I could not complete my thoughts for my weakness in the language but he understood everything.\n\nI had a mixed feeling about the events when I used the language. Firstly, I was unable to speak the French language fluently like native speakers. It took time for me to translate English into French and then deliver the speech. So, I was a late speaker. I understood most of the French instructions but was incompetent to express myself. However, it was a fresh experience for me. I used my French language skills to speak with a native for the first time in my adult life. In fact, I never talked to any French national before. With the preliminary skills, I had to pass the days at his home. But I think if I were in a hotel in Quebec, I could have missed the experience."

    "Answer": "In my humble opinion, if there is one actor in this world who deserves to be admired by his friends and foes alike, it has to be Al Pacino, or “Al Pacino – the great” is what I like to call sometimes.\n\nNow, I am not too sure when I saw this legendary actor, I mean saw in the movie, for the first time, but I am assuming that it must be quite a long time ago, given that I have developed quite a liking for him since a long time. To tell the truth, I feel like I have known him for all of my life. So, who exactly this Al Pacino is?\n\nWell, he is the 80 years old Hollywood actor who still has the ability to rock any movie or stage with his extraordinary role play and charismatic personality at any time of the day. Born in 1940 in the city of New York, this actor, with his rather average height of 5’ 7”, thick and dark brown hair, and blue eyes, started to hypnotize the movie lovers around the world with his first lead role in “The Panic in Needle Park” in 1971. Then, of course, came “The Godfather” which I consider to be one of the best 5 films ever made in this world. Since then, he has showcased his brilliant performance in all kinds of movies, including action, drama, romance and comedy, which has helped him receive many awards and nominations, including an Academy Award, two Tony Awards, and two Primetime Emmy Awards. He is one of the few performers to have received the Triple Crown of Acting.\n\nWell, I admire this legendary movie personality because of his extraordinary ability to blend in all kinds of characters, be it the angriest person in the world, innocently funny, charismatic boss or just a lovable mischievous person. In other words, he is a complete actor. I admire him also because he seems to be the only actor who has the ability to inspire us even when acting as a villain. Quite remarkable, isn’t it!"

    "Answer": "There are plenty of amazing and inspirational performing artists out there to choose from. However, for this topic, I’m going to go with my first instinct, because the first actor I can think of, must be at the forefront of my mind for a reason. If nothing else, this suggests that their work is memorable and impressive. This actress certainly is.\n\nI’m going to tell you who she is, what she looks like (‘though that is tricky, as she has had a career spanning decades); what sort of films and other work she has performed in and why it is I admire her so much.\n\nSo, the actress – or actor (in England, some women ‘actresses’ prefer to be called ‘actors’ as the word should encompass both genders really) is known affectionately as Maggie Smith. Her formal name and the title is Dame Margaret Natalie Smith, but she is so recognisable in the UK (and probably worldwide too now) that she is regarded as something of a British Institution, and everyone here in the UK would instinctively refer to her as Maggie Smith I think.\n\nIn terms of her appearance, because her career has spanned some 60 years, she has obviously changed a bit over time. However, I think that in some ways her career and recognisability have grown as she has got older, and probably she is still in her prime even now at the age of 81 (she was born in December 1934). She is very tall, upright and slender. She has an extraordinary presence and poise. Her face is very expressive - I doubt she has ever tried Botox, so she has kept her facial mobility which I’m sure must help her convey a wide range of thoughts and emotions! Her mouth is quite a straight line, and she seems to have had a run of playing fairly serious characters (serious to themselves, at any rate, they are often, in fact, comic star turns for the audiences). Her eyes and eyebrows are particularly good at communicating in a tiny movement what the character is thinking. I wouldn’t call her face wrinkled as such, but it is sort of ‘lived in’ if you know what I mean? She has a few crows’ lines or laughter lines if you prefer, around her mouth and eyes. In one word I’d say she was striking in appearance. She has an extraordinarily compelling air to her, the sort of person everyone would turn to look at as she entered a room, even without her being famous, but at the same time, she projects an air of calm confidence rather than arrogance. She tends to wear her hair in a short bob-like style. I think she has allowed her hair to go naturally grey with age, but in fact, in most of her work she wears a wig for the character anyway, so that is not her defining feature!\n\nAs for her work, well, I hardly know where to begin! She is probably most famous for the films she has been in. For example, she played Professor Minerva McGonagall in the Harry Potter film series. Other notable film appearances include ‘The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel’ and ‘Ladies in Lavender’, and the earlier acclaimed film ‘The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie’. However, she is probably one of Britain’s most recognised actresses for the many excellent quality TV period dramas she has appeared in. ‘Downton Abbey’ is one you may have heard of, she played a stern, Dowager Countess. Despite her impressive film and television career, for which she has won an extraordinary number of awards (BAFTA, Academy and Golden Globes just for starters), she began her career on stage. She has had a glittering career in the UK and America, appearing on the London West End Stages, Broadway and playing Shakespearean roles too numerous to mention. She was part of the newly established Royal National Theatre in London in the 1960’s.\n\nWhy I admire her? Well, the breadth of her career in terms of range of parts she has played is simply astonishing. She has done seemingly everything! Serious Shakespearean roles, comedy character parts; monologues film, theatre and television. She will do whatever a part requires, there is no vanity in her. She recently appeared in a film ‘The Lady in The Van’, which required her to play a belligerent and elderly homeless woman – a far from the glamorous part! Her professional longevity in a business where many actors struggle to get work is the testament to her remarkable talent. She has a gift for giving what seem to be entirely effortless performances. Whatever I have seen her in, she is totally convincing, I never think ‘wow, what a brilliant actress’ when I’m watching her, I just absolute accept the character she is portraying! If I knew what her secret was, I’d be doing it myself, but I wonder if it is perhaps partly, because whether the part she is playing is ‘comedic’ or ‘straight’ she seems to play it with conviction. She can give performances that are absolutely hilarious to watch, with a dry wit, but the character she portrays seems entirely unknowing of how funny they are being. She seems always to respect the writing and the role. She has worked really hard to be as successful as she is, and she deserved the recognition that came when she was awarded the honour of being made a British Dame. She is often spoken of as a ‘National Treasure’ and a ‘National Institution’ because her appearances are so ubiquitous in film and television (particularly period dramas), and so widely known and loved. In fact, I don’t know very much about her politics or personal life, but in a way, I don’t need to. I’d even go so far as to say I don’t want to. She is supremely good at her chosen occupation and that’s enough for me. She is well regarded by her peers, I’ve never heard any other actor say anything about her which wasn’t positive, full of admiration for both her work ethic and her talent. I think for her to be working right into her eighties is also truly remarkable. I hope she is able to continue working for many more years yet – assuming that is what she would like to do. After all, at her age, if she feels she’d finally like to put her feet up and take a rest, I think she has more than earned the right to do so!"

    "Answer": "Since settling down in one of the affluent suburbs of my city, my cousin Eric had invited me many times to visit his place, but because of a rather busy schedule from my side, I just couldn’t entertain his request until very recently. In fact, I managed to visit his place only a few weeks ago, and I would like to take this opportunity to describe his house here.\n\nAnyway, even though, I am calling it a “house”, it looks and feels more like a “luxury villa”, as far as I am concerned. The single building structure, or the actual residence, could be found there standing only on an area of 2000 square feet, but the empty space, surrounding the building, is probably as large as an average football stadium.\n\nBy the way, the whole area is surrounded by a 6 feet tall boundary with two entrances – one in the front and the other is at the back. There is a swimming pool just in front of the villa and a bit farther away from it, a beautiful garden can also be seen. I could also see at least 6 bay widows to ensure maximum light entering the house and 4 sculpted balconies around it, offering the villa a rather classy and elegant look. Inside the building, there are 4 large bedrooms, one kitchen and a huge living area, and all of them has a wooden floor on them. However, inside the rooms, which are conveniently located at a fair distance from each other in order to ensure maximum privacy, I didn’t really see many furniture, but the colour of its interior painting was simply stunningly beautiful.  \n\nWell, I really liked the villa, mainly because it was very spacious and it has all the elements of luxury. Besides, the villa is located at a safe distance from the main roads so that no noise of vehicles can be heard. Finally, I also like the fact that the villa was made with a very nice and uncommon design in an octagon shape."

    "Answer": "Well, at first, I was a bit flummoxed by this topic. I suppose that’s because it is easy to take for granted the sorts of accommodation people live in, and not really pause to think about it all that much. I have moved around a lot for work and so try not to get too attached to houses or flats I’ve rented as I am never sure how long I might be in them. The location of the accommodation is usually the most important thing for me when I’m choosing where I live, and so I don’t really tend to judge other people’s living situations as they too can be precarious. However, now you have given me the topic to talk about, I can think of one example of where a friend lives that immediately comes to mind. I’m going to tell you all about her house, where it is, what it’s like (as best I can) and the pros and cons of her choice of home.\n\nSo, this friend of mine is someone who I’ve known for years. She is married, and shares her home with her husband and two almost grown-up children. They are quite a sporty household, interested in lots of activities like walking, cycling, running and music. Both her sons play in student bands. My friend also runs her own business (mail-order cookies) from the basement of her home, so it’s quite a busy household!\n\nThe house is in Nether Edge, which is an established residential suburb in the south-west of the City of Sheffield, England. This is in colloquial terms quite a ‘posh’ area of Sheffield! It is a relatively affluent area with wide tree-lined streets and lots of little boutique shops, delicatessens and even its own well-established amateur theatre in the area. It has a real community feel, everyone there seems to know their neighbours and take an interest in what is going on on their doorstep. The houses tend to be Victorian, built of solid stone.  The grandest houses have their own walled gardens and are packed with ‘original features’ like large windows, beautiful old fire-places, picture rails and wooden floorboards. Some of the houses have now been sub-divided into flats, and there are a few newer properties tucked away within the region. Generally, though, it’s a very pretty area of the city, with a mix of attractive terraced houses and some larger detached properties. It is certainly a very ‘desirable’ place to live, particularly for people with families, as it is safe, with a community feel and properties large enough to accommodate the biggest of families.\n\nThe house my friend lives in is a beautiful rambling Victorian home. It has many original fireplaces with black hearthstones and attractive tiles along the sides of the open fire grates. There are wooden floors a-plenty, high ceilings and the house goes up three floors high as well as down into the basement. She has converted this area into a lovely kitchen for her business on one side of the basement, the other side has racks of bikes carefully stored away in the dry. In the walled garden, she can keep a few chickens – which is a relatively rare privilege in what is almost a city location. Because the house is usually a hive of activity, the kitchen is always a warm and friendly place where you can sit at the large kitchen table and catch up on gossip over a cup of coffee. From the hallway, there is a large reception room where in winter you can snuggle up in front of a roaring open fire on one of the two squidgy sofas placed in there for guests. The house has great character, a little bit of faded grandeur perhaps, but it is really impressive.\n\nWhat do I like about the property! Well, it’s gorgeous, I love the quirkiness of the Victorian property, the luxury of a real fire and the original features are stunning. It is a busy household where there is always something going on and a warm welcome too, it isn’t just the architecture of the building and the possessions within it that make it an attractive property, it is the family within it!  In my dreams, I’d love to live in a property like this, however, the reality could be a bit different. The tall ceilings and large rooms are indeed gorgeous, but they aren’t very practical in an English winter. The property is hard to heat and the electricity bills must be huge. All those open-fires and so many stairs and rooms make it hard to keep clean. Old houses don’t tend to have much in the way of storage, so there is a constant battle to find ‘homes’ for the clutter of living. Still, I reckon that would be a small price to pay for such a lovely home, one day perhaps... In the meantime, I feel very lucky that my friend is so willing to welcome me and others to come and visit her there and enjoy it too. I’ve had some very happy times in that lovely home, but you know what, if she had to move I’m sure as she is so hospitable, I’d find I quickly became just as attached to her new home even if it was a complete contrast and a small, modern flat in a high rise block. It is people that make a home, not the bricks used to construct the walls that surround them!"

The apartment is on the 3rd floor of a six-storied building which is located in the 2nd lane of the (… say the area name here…). It is only 20 minutes walking distance from my house. On average, I visit my nephew and sister twice in a month.\n\nThe whole apartment is more than 2600 square feet and has 4 bedrooms, one dining room. The verandahs are quite large and my sister had put several flower pots there which have enhanced the beauty of the whole apartment. The apartment is comparatively spacious and the while coloured indoor looks new to me. The rooms all have attached bathrooms with them and most of the furniture was bought from the most renowned and branded shops. My sister had an interior designing diploma and she has put every effort to make her own house look beautiful. From a neutral point of view, I would say she is a talented interior designer as she has been quite successful to make the interior of her own house impressive. The large wooden furniture, the modern and sophisticated design of most of the furniture and handpicked wall-frames gives a rich impression to a guest who visits this apartment.\n\nI like this apartment because it has got a large space, unlike in many other apartments I have visited. The rooms give complete privacy to the house members as they are not adjacent to each other. The interior of the apartment is quite attractive. Moreover, my sister, as an interior designer has designed it perfectly. The apartment gives me the impression of beauty and comfort. For these reasons, I love this apartment."

    "Answer": "In my mind, I think that the 20th century has produced more prolific and accomplished writers, with the finest minds, than any other times in human history. Today, I would like to talk about one such writer who I would certainly like to meet without even wasting a second.\n\nThe name of this world-famous writer is Ernest Hemmingway. Though he dies  many years ago, I would still want to travel back in time and meet this great writer.\n\nI came to learn about this great writer for the first time when we all had to read “The old man and the sea” in our high school. Of course, back then, I had no clue whatsoever about what actually made a great writer. But, as I grew older and started to read more and more books, I eventually understood the tricks of being a great writer.\n\nAnyway, Ernest Hemmingway was an American journalist, novelist, and short-story writer. Born in the year of 1939, this writer didn’t really gain much fame during his lifetime, but he certainly had his fair share of admiration from the later generations because of his adventurous lifestyle (took part in the first world war and also was a journalist during the second world war) and great public image. Having a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, Ernest Hemmingway’s many works are considered to be classics in American literature today. However, his greatest success came when he got The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 for his mastery of the art of narrative and the influence on contemporary style.\n\nAnyway, I would like to meet Ernest Hemmingway, even if means I will need to travel back in time, because there are still so much to know about him, such as what really motivated him to be a writer even though he had the opportunity to pursue another career. I would also like to know how it really felt to witness the two most devastating wars in human history. I would like to meet him also because it would allow me to learn the tricks of writing my experience, just as he did, in a minimal fashion. After all, I also want to become a writer someday."

    "Answer": "Writing is a great profession and I believe the writers come with a special type of virtues. So, meeting the writers is interesting and I would like to meet Stephen King for his extraordinary story developing capability, especially horror and mysterious stories.\n\nStephen Edwin King, commonly known as Stephen King to his readers, was born in 1947. He is also famous for his pen name – Richard Bachman. King is skilled in composing stories in genres like horror, mystery, science fiction, supernatural fiction and others. Some of his books are bestsellers while some of the books have been adapted for films as well. Besides, his books are globally admired and even comic books have also been made with the characters created on his books. So far, King has created around 54 books under his authorship and Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time which is adapted from one of his books of the similar name.\n\nTo me, King is one of the greatest writers of all times. He is famous for his distinctive style of narration and the plots are undoubtedly extraordinary. He has also achieved some prestigious awards for his contribution to the US literature. To make the long story short, King has achieved a wide number of awards and his works have been nominated for adaptations. His father was a merchant seaman from Peru in Indiana. But King’s family had to experience hardship as his father had left the family with a trick. It is said that the death of one of his dearest friends, in his childhood, made him inspired to create his darker works. His interest to write horror might have appeared from the reading of horror comics in his early days.      \n\nAs far as I realise, King had a spiky childhood. He was deprived of fatherly affection and love. A substantial portion of his life underwent amid hardship, struggle and survival were challenging. His academic career also experienced some shocks. But he overcame all the obstacles to his success. Now he is one of the most influential writers. He is a wealthy man now. He can do whatever he wants in terms of a writer, an influential person and a revered celebrity. But I would like to dig deeper into his life. In fact, it is impossible for everyone to overcome the adversities of life. The majority of them get ruined while the remaining are abolished from the earth. But there are some exceptional people who have overcome the barriers to success. So, I would like to find out and know about the secrets that have kept him so energetic and inspired. Actually, I want to learn from his firsthand experience to stand upright amid thousands of troubles.    \n\nThere are people who are extraordinary in every aspect. I sense King is one of them and even a five-minute meet with him may teach me a large number of things. In fact, the things I will learn from him are unavailable in books, seminars or in other meetings. These are his real-life experiences and invaluable. So, is I have a chance to meet him, I would come to know about the undisclosed issues of life. Moreover, it is a dream for me to meet my dearest writer. If I can meet him, I could come to a conclusion on how to deal with the adversities of life. In fact, the meet with King is beneficial for me in several aspects."

    "Answer": "Who doesn’t like nice weather? I think that we all do, except, of course, we just do not get the opportunity to enjoy such a nice or perfect weather that often. But, today, I would like to talk about a day when I thought the weather was impeccable. Thank you for this great cue card topic.\n\nNow, before I go to describe my version of a “perfect weather”, it is important to understand that different people have different ideas about “perfect” weather, depending on where one is born or grown-up. So, anyway, talking about a day when I thought the weather was just too excellent, I experienced such a perfect day about a few months ago when I decided to take a walk outside of my home on a fine summer evening.\n\nBy that time, the sun had very died down and there was almost no moisture in the air but certainly enough to smell the soil around me. The temperature was so pleasant that I almost wanted to take my shirt off to offer my skin, which remains almost always covered except when I am taking shower, the taste of a perfect temperature. A very gentle breeze was also blowing past my ears to offer me even a more “fresh” feeling around me. In fact, it felt so fresh around me that for a minute, I actually thought that I would just take my shoes and socks off and sit on the fresh-looking, green grass laying nicely on the side of the road, in order to feel the mother nature around me more closely, but decided against it and instead just kept walking as long as I could.\n\nAnyway, I thought the weather was perfect on that day, mainly because it made me feel very alive and energetic. In fact, I probably had walked for almost 2 hours and yet never felt a hint of tiredness in me. It felt perfect also because the nature around me on that day was so fresh and inviting."

    "Answer": "Days before the winter are perfect, I think, for travelling across the beaches in Florida. The days remain sunny and clouds float on the air with a light shape. In such a day, I went to Clearwater Beach last month and had some wonderful moments.\n\nThe Clearwater Beach is located on the west-central coast of Florida and the entire area is divided into several parts- residential and resorts. The locality is famous for its white sandy beaches. The beach is around four kilometres in length. Different water vehicles and ships always occupy the harbour. Besides, there are some restaurants available to cater to the needs of travellers in the locality. Usually, a large flock of the visitors get engaged with leisure activities like jet ski driving, travel on boats, parasailing, golfing, fishing etc. on the beach. In such days, the beach area remains crowded by thousands of local and foreign tourists.\n\nThe beach is considered as one of the best beaches in the USA and the resorts also famous for its world-class service. Besides, the weather was sunny and clear. Right before the winter, there are some changes in the weather pattern. But fortunately, there were little such changes found and thus I planned for the trip. Actually, I had long been planning that I will rise early in the morning and pass an entire day at the Clearwater Beach in such sunny weather. But hardly I could manage time then for my classes and exams. Since my exams were over, I was a bit relaxed and made the day out for me, alone. If the weather was cloudy, I could not have done the trip to Clearwater Beach. I think I had to wait for some other day to make it happen.\n\nAfter breakfast on the day, my first destination was to reach the beach on foot (this was a 15-minute walk from my home in Florida). Earlier I had lost my shoes and decided to move now on barefoot. Arriving at the beach, I selected a place to make my camp with the umbrella. I walked for around half an hour on the beach. The sands were wet by waves and I felt no heat reflected from them. I took a boat tour for the next hour. Visiting the Clearwater marine aquarium was another great experience for me. Though I visited the place with dad, it was my first solo visit. I planned to have a ride on the waterski but discarded the idea due to the unusual waiting line. Just before noon, I swam on the beach for half an hour. In fact, I played with some kids on the water than swimming.   \n\nUsually, the Florida weather is almost unpredictable. Though it rains heavily in October for the subtropical climatic condition, fall makes late to appear and summer does the same. In such conditions, the weather remains sunny only for few days. I took the chance and made my day. The day started with a bright sun and fortunately, I had no important tasks to complete. The college is closed for three days and it was more convenient for me to go out. Considering all the aspects, I thought the weather was perfect for going to the beach. At the end of the day, I really enjoyed the perfect weather."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this candidate task card and the opportunity to let me talk about a day when the weather was just perfect.  \n\nIt would be around 4 to 5 months ago and I was supposed to meet my friends on our college campus in the morning. This was a weekend and we planned to visit a local park and then play cricket on our college playground. The wind was chilly the previous night and that is why I took a jacket with me. The sun, however, unlike the past few days, was shining brightly and the sky was clear and blue. Just after I reached the college campus, I found that my friends were already there. Together we walked to the park and spent an hour there. In fact, this was our favourite park and we often visited it during our college days. The sweet and gentle breeze in the park was quite comfortable. I checked the temperature on my smartphone and it showed that the temperature was 17-degree Celsius. The weather forecast said that the weather on this day would be quite comfortable and it would be a sunny day. Though weather forecasts are often proven wrong, this was not the case on this day! The slight possibility of fog on the weather forecast was also true but not before 11.00 pm at night.\n\nAfter we left the park, we ate burgers at a local fast-food restaurant and brought balls, stamps, bats and other equipment from a friend's house to play cricket. We played cricket for approximately 2 hours and I bowled for more than 7-8 overs. The humidity was so good that even after we played for a long, we were not perspiring. The wind did not bother with playing at all. What could we expect more than that!  \n\nI went home at around 2.30 pm and was tired. After I took a shower, I slept for a while and went out for a walk with my mother in the evening.\n\nThe mild temperature, the sunshine, soothing humidity, gentle breeze, and the season made it a perfect day to hang out with friends, play outdoor games and take a walk in the evening. I was outside for the most part of the day and it was neither cold not too hot. Previous few weeks were almost freezing cold and we hardly saw the sun during this time. However, the day I am talking about had been an exceptionally bright and sunny day with a clear blue sky and a gentle wind. This was just perfect weather everyone in our town could wish for!"

    "Answer": "My friend, a political science teacher at a local college, and I often argue about the roles of the large empires in shaping the history of our world. And to prove our points and arguments, we try to watch TV documentaries, especially the documentaries on “important political events” in history and collect information from them. Today, I would like to talk about one such documentary which I watched about a year ago which was quite interesting.\n\nThe documentary, I want to talk about, was on the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. It, of course, was a series of documentaries (even though, I didn’t really manage to watch all of them) which tried to discuss 600 years of history of the Roman Empire in as much depth as possible in chronological order.\n\nIt has one particular episode on the Roman republic days with the problems of northern Gallic tribes, and then it also talks about the role of Caesar in shaping the empire and so forth. By the way, I already had learned a little about the history of the Roman Empire, by reading different kinds of books and watching some historical facts on TV before, but this particular documentary taught me a great deal about the history of western civilization as a whole.\n\nHowever, what was really remarkable about this documentary was that it really tried to contradict a very popular view, and a very important also in that, that the Romans were bad people and also the enemy of Christianity but they become good people after converting to Christianity. Besides, the documentary taught me a very crucial point (which other people may not agree with) and that is, our human history is nothing but the history of numerous wars and conflicts.\n\nAnyway, the TV documentary was particularly interesting to be me because it opened my eyes to the flaws and greatness of the Roman civilization which also essentially is the civilization of Europe. I found it interesting also because Christian religion indeed played a very important role in shaping the European civilization even though many Europeans today like to disagree with it."

    "Answer": "A plate of yummy food can remove the tiredness of the day. In fact, we eat, we live and this is true for all living being. But recently I had seen a documentary about food and their processing that shocked me heavily and it was one of the most interesting TV documentaries I have ever seen.  \n\nPeople take food for several reasons, and the most prominent of them is their craving for the food or they want comfort for their hunger. But my idea of taking food for comfort has been changed after watching the \"Food Inc.\", a documentary on the food habits, food processing and how the large corporations cheating on innocent people. Actually, the documentary unfolded some blind parts of the food industry across the world. Food habits and tastes have been changed with the course of time and to meet the growing needs, the food-producing corporations are following numerous irrational ways and having their profits.  \n\nGenerally, before watching any movie or documentary, I like to do some homework on them such as I analyse rating, read reviews etc. to know if they are worth watching. Accordingly, I found that Food, Inc., a documentary by Robert Kenner, has been nominated for some prestigious awards in the USA. Moreover, the teaser of the documentary also attracted me. So, I started watching this documentary and came to know about a large number of confidential issues regarding food business. In fact, staying healthy is not enough today, we should be also careful about our food selection. The food items that we take from the superstores and chain shops are entirely unhealthy for us. At the same time, food producers are damaging the environment. Such issues were highly confidential until Mr Kenner unveiled them on screen through his documentary. Watching the documentary film was a nice experience for me.  \n\nFood, Inc. taught me a wide number of things and I try to follow them in my own lifestyle. Basically, the documentary is an analysis of the existing food markets - how these food items are grown, how the corporations are abusing the environment, food, animals and people engaged in the food processing, how they are cheating the consumers and more other intriguing issues. The advertisements of different food products show that the foods items are handpicked directly from the farms. But in reality, they are not, the foods are ‘manufactured’ in factories. Has anyone ever thought how the seasonal vegetables are available all around the year or how they are found in plenty during the off-season? No, we do not think about such issues. We are not allowed to! The food industry owners do not want us to know these secrets lest they fail in the business. Moreover, the filmmaker had to remain careful about legal issues against him, the production company and channel that would broadcast it while making this documentary.      \n\nFood, Inc. has taught me some good and valuable lessons. I think it is good to be healthy but at the same time, we should be careful about the foods we eat. There are three segments of the documentary and each of the parts revealed some highly sought information for the audiences that the food producers never wanted to expose in public. The entire productions process, especially in the case of meat, it is inhumane and disastrous to the environment. Besides, the large-scale productions of grains, green vegetables and fruits are also not sustainable. The majority of the vegetables and fruits are preserved with toxic chemicals harmful to human health. The advertisements create an appealing impression of the food and grains are gathered from a large ranch filled with green plants. But the inner scenario is completely different and there are no links at all to the large farms or greeneries. I loved the documentary for its bold expression of unethical activities from the food industry owners."

I had to decide among 4-5 best and the most intriguing TV documentaries I have ever watched. 'The War Game' - a 1965 TV documentary that I watched in 2012 is the TV documentary I would like to talk about.\n\n'The War Game' was directed and written by Peter Watkins and was distributed in the UK by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It was a television drama, a masterpiece that depicted the nuclear war. This documentary portrayed the horrified and catastrophic effects of war and was quite interesting to watch. It was awarded the Academy Award for the Best Documentary in 1966.\n\nThis was approximately a 50-minute black-and-white documentary that I watched all of a sudden. It was the evening time and it was raining outside. I sat on a sofa and was surfing different satellite TV  channels. All of a sudden I tuned to BBC and within a few minutes, this documentary started. It would be 2012, I guess. The documentary was so absorbing, shocking, horrifying and yet interesting that I was glued to the sofa.\n\n'The War Game' depicts the prelude to as well as the immediate weeks of the aftermath of a Soviet nuclear attack against Britain. The documentary ends on a gloomy Christmas day after the nuclear war. The story was told like a news magazine programme style which made it even more interesting.\n\nWhile watching this documentary I realised the brutality of wars, unimaginable destructions nuclear weapons can cause, how people become the victims of war, how a single wrong decision can cost the lives of millions, how cities and civilisations can be wiped out in few minutes and finally that wars are political decisions that should never happen in the first place.\n\nThe topic, filming, narrating, theme, casting, camera work, the depiction of wars, true events are all very fascinating in this documentary. As soon as I finished watching it, I realised this was worth watching TV documentary and I would recommend it to my close friends. In fact, it was so interesting that I watched it once again in 2013."

So, essentially, I had all the free times in my hand to do random things as I wished before starting high school. But, of course, I needed to be careful as my parents were just not ready to listen to any excuses from my part had I really got into any kind of troubles. After all, they had laid down very clear guidelines as to what I was supposed to do, and what I wasn’t.\n\nBut, I was just too “bold” not to stick to the guidelines when it had come to messing with my fathers’ beautiful motorbike as, one day, in the absence of my father, I took the motorbike key and started its engine while it stood on its stands. Everything was fine this far, but the problem started when I started to jump up and down on the motorbike seat to mimic the physical movement of a biker on a running motorbike. In fact, in the process of jumping up and down on the motorbike seat, I lost my control and fell down on the ground with the motorbike also falling on top of me. As soon as I fell, I used all my strength to help the motorbike stand just the way it was but not before having a few bruises on my body and a torn-up shirt.  \n\nAnyway, when I accidentally fell down with the motorbike also falling on me, I started to panic because I didn’t want anybody to see me in that state. I also felt hurt on my body, but that was the least bit of my worry because I was more concerned at that time about how to offer a “credible” explanation to my parents about the bruises which I received on my body."

It was a very remote area and we had to travel for more than 11 hours to reach there. I lived with my parents in (…town/ city name…) but most of my uncles and their families lived in the village. As this was a joint family, I had so many cousins and I loved to visit this countryside for that. My parents were busy on a hot summer day during our stay there and I got the chance the play with my cousins. We played several games and got quite tired and then all of a sudden one of my cousins proposed that we should all go to the river and swim. I was a bit confused as I did not know how to swim. However, one of my cousins convinced me that I should always stay near them and should not try to go further in the river by any means.\n\nWe did not inform anyone and four of us walked for about 20 minutes to reach the river bank. It was summer noon and the river looked very placid to me. I went down the river and was trying to stay as near to the land as possible. However, my cousins were all swimming and were having fun. I do not know how but all of a sudden I felt that I was in deep water and two of my cousins were trying to pull me back. I remember that I was struggling a lot to get closer to them but the sudden waves were forcing me far deeper. That time I was quite frightened and was shouting for help. Two of my cousins went to get some help and luckily two adults came to the rescue.\n\nI would say these two good-natured unknown people saved my life that day. I was too young and too intimidated to handle the situation myself. I would say I got lucky that day.\n\nIt’s quite tough to explain how I actually felt that day. I was frightened and was completely taken aback by the surprise trouble. It was surely a near-death experience and even though I am a good swimmer now, I remain very cautious whenever I get into the water."

    "Answer": "Hmmm… it depends on what you mean by trouble! I can think of an example which was very troublesome at the time, even now I look back and cringe in embarrassment as I recall and relive the incident. I shouldn’t really though! With the distance of time, and looking at it from a different perspective, I probably got it rather out of proportion at the time.\n\nSo, I’m going to try and tell you what the situation was together with how I got into it. How I handled it (badly), and how I felt about it.\n\nSo, I must have been about 13 years old at the time. This can be a bit of an awkward and self-conscious age, which is why I found the situation so difficult. What happened was, I had to catch a train to somewhere. I can’t even remember where I was going. I went down to my local railway station, and bought a ticket from the station manager at the ticket office. I then made my way down a long tunnel towards the platform. I found I had a few minutes to spare, so I decided to take a little detour to go to the loo so I would be more comfortable with my journey. There was a lady's public convenience down another dark passageway, which was at right angles to the main tunnel. I wandered down, and as I went into the lavatory block, I noticed the main entrance door clanged shut behind me. I didn’t think much of it at the time. I just nipped into one of the cubicles, and then after I’d finished and washed my hands I went to leave. I approached the big, solid, metal door, and found to my horror it was locked shut. It didn’t even have a door handle. It was a really heavy-duty secure door, almost like you’d expect to see in a bank vault. For some inexplicable reason, once it slammed closed behind me, it couldn’t be opened again other than with a key, and only from the other side! I was locked in, that door wasn’t going to open again for me ever. Uh oh!\n\nTo begin with, I was a bit irritated, but not really worried. I thought someone else was bound to walk by at some point, and they’d spot the door was locked and ask for it to be opened. It was a bit inconvenient, but it was hardly the end of the world. This didn’t happen. Quite a few minutes passed. Then a few more. I started to feel a bit anxious. The station master was too far away to see or hear me, and because the lavatory block was at the end of a side passage, it began to dawn on me that really, very few people would bother to go down it. I looked around. I was essentially in a dark, locked room. There was a single window with bars across it, but it was really high up. What’s more, because of the way the station was designed, this window actually overlooked a street that was the opposite side of the station entrance. From the street, even assuming I could attract someone’s attention, it wouldn’t be at all obvious where my voice was coming from, or how on earth to get to space I was trapped in. It wasn’t even a very well-used walkway, I had no way of telling if any people were using it – the window was far too high up for me to see out of it. Pretty soon, I heard the rumble of the train I was supposed to have caught as it pulled into the station, stopped and then pulled away again. Fifteen minutes later, I heard the next train come and go. It was time to act if I was going to get out by nightfall!\n\nCautiously, I scrambled up onto one of the toilets, and hanging on to piping, managed to get as close as I could to the barred window. It must have been left open, so I had some chance of making enough noise to get some attention. To begin with, I was a bit shy about shouting out. I tried a few tentative ‘hellos’ and ‘excuse me’, no reaction, nothing. It would have been a quiet street anyway, and I had no way of knowing if there were any passers-by at all there in any case, let alone whether they could hear me, as I couldn’t see a thing! Eventually, my fear of being shut in there all day and maybe all night too got the better of me. I just screamed ‘help, help!’ After what seemed like an age, I finally heard an almighty clunk as a big old-fashioned key turned in the lock of the door behind me. The station master who’d sold me a ticket about an hour ago had come to my rescue. I climbed down from the toilet, I was relieved to be let out, but I was also mortified. I could have sworn he was smirking a bit, laughing at my plight – though now I look back it probably was a bit comical, and it was hardly his fault I’d got into this predicament!  I mumbled thanks rather sheepishly, without making eye contact, and raced past him to catch the next train and to get away from there as fast as I could. I never did find out who it was who heard my cries, worked out I was in the station and went to alert the station manager to my plight.\n\nSo how did I feel about it? Well, at the time I found the situation excruciating. I was so embarrassed that the station manager had had to come and rescue me that I avoided using the railway station for months afterwards, even though it was the one nearest to where I lived. I preferred to walk an extra couple of miles to the next stop and so avoid having to see him again. Even when I did start to use my local railway station again I never, ever used the public conveniences, just in case…\n\nSo, whilst I’d be the first to concede that getting locked in a public lavatory isn’t the worst of troubles to befall someone, it certainly felt like a big deal at the time. I was literally red-faced, as my cheeks were burning with embarrassment at the time when I was rescued. For ages, afterwards, whenever I thought about it I blushed again. If this same situation happened to me now I’d probably just laugh it off… After all, it was hardly life-threatening, and I’m not the first or last person to get locked in a toilet block I’m sure! I suppose also in truth I’d probably also have a mobile phone with me nowadays (this story happened pre the advent of mobile phones) so it would be rather easier to summon help more quickly too! Even so, whenever I’m using a public loo in an unfamiliar area these days, I always have a little look at the doors and locks before I commit to entering alone… you can’t be too careful as I’ve learned from bitter personal experience!"

    "Answer": "I indeed have received funny text messages from my friends on a number of occasions in order to enjoy some light moments from time to time with each other, and today, I would like to talk about one such occasion.\n\nI received this text message about a few months ago from one of my close friends who never miss a chance to make jokes with other people around him, whether he knows them or not.\n\nAnyway, on that day, I was actually on my way to buy a desktop computer. However, my budget was rather low, and so I was essentially looking for a bargain. My friends, including the one who is always in the mood to make jokes about anything, knew about this plan of spending as little money as possible in buying a computer. Of course, all of my friends had already told me that I wouldn’t really be able to buy a good computer with a good configuration with such a low budget, but I just thought that I was just going to get lucky and get a very good deal on my computer. But, obviously, I wasn’t really that lucky because in the end, I did, after all, had to spend a lot more money to buy my computer, as my friend had told than I initially had planned for.\n\nThe next day, I told about this to my friends after feeling really sorry for myself, and immediately after learning this, my funny friend sent me a message which said: “Our government has declared a 3-day mourning for the whole nation because a valuable citizen like you has suffered a huge monetary loss in buying a computer”. Needless to say, I started to laugh like crazy after receiving the message.\n\nI thought it was a funny text message because it actually made me forget about my monetary loss for a while. The message was funny also because it dragged the government into it rather successfully in order to offer a “serious yet a very funny sound effect” to it."

    "Answer": "Though some people might disagree, I find the concept of sending and receiving text messages quite fascinating. I often send text messages to others and love receiving witty and humorous text messages from my friends.\n\nI got a very funny text message from Rocky and it was one of the funniest text messages I’ve ever received.  This funny text message was about another friend who had a funny way of taking and dealing with others.\n\nRocky was my best buddy during my university days and we still are quite good friends. We often try to meet each other even in our busy office schedules. He often sends me text messages and most of his messages have some kind of humour or a unique way of expressing something. The particular message I am talking about was sent by him and we were in our 7th terms in our university. As far as I recall I laughed for a few minutes after I read his SMS. This was funny yet thought-provoking SMS while it actually characterised another funny friend of ours.\n\nIt described how the friend in question uses his money to earn respect and companionship from others. However, his trick does not work with us and this is something he has complained about to Rocky that days. On the evening Rocky sent me a text message which was more like a poem and it was quite a good one. I quite liked the rhyme and underlying meaning of the message and that’s why I still remember it quite well."

    "Answer": "It is nearly impossible for me to compose a funny text message marking any occasion as many other people do. But my cousin, Henry, is able to compose some extraordinary messages and he had sent me such a funny text message on my 22nd birthday.  \n\nIn fact, I turned 22 three months ago and observed my birthday amid a festive mood. I received a good number of gifts and wishes, and among them, funny SMS was the best gift for me. The SMS was about wishing me a happy birthday in a special tone. I was glad indeed having the SMS. The SMS read, “Actually, I wanted to get you something super great, super terrific, unique and beautiful for your birthday, but I don’t fit into the envelope.” I laughed a lot once I got the meaning of this text message.  \n \nHenry Johnson is my cousin. He lives near our residence of Port Elizabeth in South Africa. In fact, the entire family of my parents live in the same locality. Earlier, they used to live in an extended family but with the change of time, the family extension has been split and they have settled in a scattered manner covering an entire locality. So, often they come to visit us and this is similar for us as well. We love celebrating events together. Even, they all appear if they are not on the invitation list, and I like this cordial tradition most. Marking the birthday, I received the text message from Henry but he also brought a pleasant gift for me in the evening when the birthday party was held.   \n\nHe had sent me the text message at midnight. I received the text when it was just 12.01 am. I think he was counting his moments to send me the message at the right time to wish me. I was surprised. Henry was the very first man to wish me on that night and then I started receiving other text messages containing wishes of my friends and relatives. All of them wished me a very happy birthday and also wanted me to see smiling throughout my life. I was feeling lucky at this stage as a notable number of people and friends care for me. They have shown their love and care for me through the wishes and the presented me with the gifts which I liked most. In fact, the presents and wishes were encouraging to me and I loved them all.\n \nI received a large number of gifts and text messages marking the birthday and the text message from Henry was probably the best and funny. He wanted to send himself as my birthday gift, but unfortunately, he was unable to fit him in the envelope! So he sent me the text and wished the birthday. The SMS was funny to me because I could not get the meaning immediately after I received it. Once I got the meaning, I laughed for a while. Then I replied to him with a potential solution to his problem – ‘You can arrange for a bag, get inside and walk to our home in the evening’. Henry was amazed at my instant reply and texted me back that he would try it on some other day."

    "Answer": "As a young boy, I really enjoyed going to school as it allowed me to learn new things and make new friends. But, there were a couple of rules at my high school which I didn’t really enjoy that much, and today I would like to talk about one of them here.\n\nThe rule, I am talking about, was related to attending PT (physical training) classes. As students of our high school, we all were required to attend physical training classes at least two times a week, apparently to remain physically fit and also to get some bonus class marks at end of every term. Or at least, that’s what our school authority had thought.\n\nBut, as for me, I thought that I was way more fit and healthy than I could ever ask for! After all, I would almost always remain active in either playing with my friends or doing something else, outside of my sleeping hours and school hours. Of course, you could ask me about how exactly I was doing with my homework and class tests since I said that I was fairly fit and healthy. My response would be that neither my parents nor my school teachers had any problem with my academic performance. So, I guess that I was doing just fine on that front, and that’s probably why I didn’t really hesitate to violate this rule on many occasions, even though I frequently had to get admonished because of such unruly behaviour.\n\nBut, of course, my consolation was that, like me, a significant number of other students also violated this rule (not attending physical training classes) and as such, had to deal with some harsh “verbal assault” from our physical training instructor.   \n\nAnyway, if you are wondering about why exactly I didn’t like this rule, I would say that it would carry on for too long and thus making me a bit too tired for my liking. Besides, thought that the class was too boring since I was pretty much doing the same thing every day."

    "Answer": "Well, this topic reminds me of my school days when things were quite different than they are now. Things were magical, more colourful and in my mind everything was possible. I quite loved my school days and our teachers were very friendly. When some of my neighbours were worried about their kids in schools, my parents, on the contrary, were very contented about their son’s schooling.\n\nI loved everything about my school except one thing – attending the cultural programmes arranged by the teachers and class captains on last Thursday of the month. It was mandatory to attend this event every month and I did not like it at all.\n\nI mostly hated it because I thought that attending this event should have been optional, not mandatory. If I loved singing, dancing, debating or acting only then I would have felt attracted to such events and in my case, this was not true. I loved listening to music but when I had to sing, I simply loathed it. Same goes for dancing, debating, poem writing, acting in Shakespeare’s play and so on. In my timid and fragile mind, this was kind of torture. Though I feel differently these days about this rule and event and find it quite charming, it was not the case in my school days. Another reason I did not like the rule was that the power the class captains exercised during the event. To illustrate how they used their power I would like to tell you an event. One day I had a disagreement with my class captain and he threatened me that he will have his revenge soon. Two weeks later during the cultural programme, he selected me as a volunteer singer in a play without even notifying me. That was quite an embarrassing moment for me.\n\nI think others mostly enjoyed this event and rule until they were called to attend the programme in front of the teachers and other students. Some of our classmates have passions in such events and they enjoyed participating and they felt that everybody should attend it. A few students were more attracted to sports and TV shows and they did not like it as far as I recall. I actually violated these rules quite a few times. Once my parents came to meet my math teacher and I went home with them and skipped this programme. In many other occasions, I tried to skip attending this programme and in some cases I was successful.\n\nIf you ask me whether this was a good rule or not, I would say, this was in fact, a good rule to introduce art, literature and cultural programs to the young students. I learned more about Shakespeare and his work through this programme than reading academic books. Thus it was a good initiative and a good rule as I understand now."

    "Answer": "In my early days, schooling was never fun for me as it is today for the kids. In fact, I had to go through some unwanted and tiresome rules and regulations like detention in my school days. I will discuss the entire issue now.\n\nDetention is a kind of punishment, or a disciplinary measure’ – termed by our honourable teachers. They liked the process very much and ordered anyone even for the slightest excuse of discipline violation. I was lucky in this sense that I did not have to undergo any corporal punishment from my school in Kentucky in the USA that my ancestors did. But at the moment when the nation was forwarding in at a great speed, punishing the kids with detention was really unwanted and not welcomed by many, especially the students. But nobody stepped ahead to protest about this ‘touching’ issue at the schools. Now I am free of the troubles but the experiences were really shocking.  \n\nThe teachers and parents were positive about this particular disciplinary measures and they became glad when they heard their kids have been taken to detention at the school. In fact, they were of the view that the kids will be disciplined if they are punished for violation of the rules and regulations of schools. Yet the view was different among us – who were detained or punished in other forms. So, we were always in serious trouble when the detention order was issued for us. Actually, it was not a pleasant experience to be detained for three to four hours and have some extra burdens or assignments. Thereby, a majority of the students were unwilling to violate any rules and regulations of the school lest they are detained in the holidays.  \n\nOnce I had violated the rule. But I was not that much matured to realise the consequences of the violations. Fortunately, the teacher who issued the detention did not carefully investigate the issue and thus I was saved. On a Saturday, I was detained for six hours in the detention zone of the school with the charges of copying from another student’s answer script in the exam. But I left the place after only half an hour and fortunately the teacher who issued the detention was a bit careless about me as he thought I would be unable to get out before the detention was over. Actually, it was a tremendous success for me to bunk the detention.    \n\nThe school I studied had some hard and fast rules. If someone violated the slightest part of the rule, s/ he had to be punished. Sometimes the punishments took place for weird reasons. I was punished for my forgetfulness. Often I forgot to bring the homework copies and as a result, I was punished with detention for an extra one or two hours. Even sometimes, my parents also had to appear before the teachers to reduce the punitive measures. The entire environment was horrible at that time. The same thing happened to many of the other kids in my class. They turned reluctant to attend school fearing the punishments. For all such reasons, I did not like the rule of detention. However, I could not avoid the rule until I was in ninth grade. the students of this grade were free of the detention rules."

    "Answer": "I think that everybody likes to talk about famous people, probably because we all like to identify with them in one way or another. So, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to talk about a famous person who, I think, has some really good reasons to be considered as famous.\n\nThe famous person, I am talking about, is a prominent and former sportsperson, a very good soccer/football player that is, from my city where I currently live in now. His name is David Fernando and he was already a famous person in my city and other areas because of his excellent footballing skills, but later on, he became equally famous also because of his extensive social works and philanthropic activities.\n\nBy the way, I came to know about this famous person probably about 15 years ago for the first time when he came to visit my high school at the invitation of our high school game teacher, apparently because he (our game teacher) wanted his students to become more interested and encouraged to play football. Prior to that, of course, I did hear about this famous person as a great footballer, but when I saw him and got to talk to him in person, I became really overwhelmed with immense joy and happiness.\n\nHowever, one terrible accident (one of his legs became permanently damaged and weak) about 5 years ago ended his sports career, but since then, he has engaged himself with all kinds of philanthropic activities in my area. Needless to say, many people from my area, so far, have benefited from these philanthropic activities of his for the last 5 years or so.\n \nAnyway, he is so famous in my area, mainly because he hasn’t only spent his own hard-earned money, earned as a very good football player, but also encouraged many others to do the same. Particularly, his contribution to running the biggest orphanage in my city, as well as helping in building one of the biggest private orthopaedic hospitals in my country, has made him famous."

Instead of talking about a nationally famous person, I would prefer to talk about my uncle.\n\nHe is my favourite uncle and I like him for his amiable behaviours and talent. He is a kind-hearted and benevolent man who is around 45 years old now. Since he is my father’s only brother and was very close to us, I know him my whole life. Personally, I am quite attached to this uncle and we often play chess together or enjoy movies in a theatre.\n\nAs far as I recall, he has always been famous in our town. He is known to his student as a talented math professor, to his colleagues he is an excellent person, to us, he is a great mentor and to others, he is a helpful and kind person. However, his fame extended beyond our city area for his achievement of a national award as the best math book writer. His book is used in grade seven as a national textbook and this single achievement has made him famous among many literary and educated societies in the country.  He was once been in the headline of many national daily newspapers which I still remember very clearly.\n\nAs far as I know, he is kind of an introvert and not after fame or popularity. He has very little interest in money or personal achievements. I had many long discussions with him and I have come to the decision that he leads an exemplary life and he is quite a happy person. Like many other famous people, he has no desire for personal achievements and his good deeds and talent have earned him respects and popularity. When people find out that I am his nephew they treat me differently and this single aspect clearly demonstrates how popular and respected he really is."

    "Answer": "Fame does not come fast, rather it takes time, dedication and hard work. The people who have been famous, are sincere and hard workers. My cousin, Ali Karimi is also a famous person in my land, Iran. He is a footballer.\n\nAli Karimi is my maternal cousin and lives with his parents. He is now a popular footballer and midfielder in position. He is set to play in the 2018 FIFA World Cup as part of Irani football team. He had a great career in this short span of time. Currently, he is playing with Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb. He was keen to play football since his early age and finally, after 2010, he started shining in his career as a footballer. He signed with Sepahan, a football club in 2010 and played there in under-19. Karimi also played many leagues at home and abroad and thus he got selected for the national team of Iran for FIFA World Cup.   \n\nI know him since my childhood. In fact, he is my cousin and used to live the next door of us in the same city in Iran. He was brilliant in academic studies and loved playing football. But he was troubled with my uncle as he did not want his son to be a footballer. So, often Karimi had to experience anger from his father on his football issues. But later, the attitude of my uncle towards football was changed to a great extent when he sensed the success of his son. In fact, he realised his mistakes that Karimi owns the potentials to be a great footballer. When uncle realised the issue, he helped Karimi in all possible ways.\n\nKarimi is four years senior to me. He was born in 1994 and I was born in 1999. So, as per the calculation, Karimi is 22 now and I am 17. But age was not a barrier for us to form a very good relationship. Both of us share a strong bond and the bond is existing even today. He is a very caring brother to me and takes good care of almost all of my issues. He loves me as he loved his own sister. Though he is famous now across the country, he is amicable in his personal life and maintains a good relation with everyone regardless of his familiarity with them or not. Usually, celebrities are reluctant to have socialisation with the ordinary people but Karimi is different from them.\n\nKarimi had to struggle a lot to gain his current position. His childhood was filled with obstacles. He was repressed by his family, especially his father did not want him to be a footballer. Rather he was instructed to be a scholar and then finally possess over their family business. But the liberal mind of Karimi was unable to follow the traditional ways of life. He wanted changes and take challenges. So, he tried hard to be a footballer. He started playing with the local clubs and finally got the chance to appear before the limelight. In this year, he has joined at Dinamo Zagreb and he is supposed to play for the club for the next five years. He is rich, he is famous but he is simple in his lifestyle. Hope he would be more successful in the coming days."

    "Answer": "When I was attending my junior high school about almost 12 years ago, I remember writing some letters to my friends and my grandfather. Of course, writing a letter to my friends was fun, but writing one to my grandfather was even more special. So, today, I would like to talk about a letter which I wrote to my grandfather.\n\nLike any other grandfathers, my grandfather was the most favourite person to me also in the whole wide world, apparently, because he never used admonish me or discipline me even when I was an “unruly” boy. Besides, since he also used to buy me all kinds of things, like sunglasses, nice wristwatches, and delicious cookies/ or chocolates, I never really wanted to stay away from him. But, that, of course, wasn’t always possible because my parents had to live in different places at different times because of professional reasons. But, whenever I would leave my grandfather to live with my parents, I would write letters to my grandfather telling him how much I missed him.\n\nBut, this one letter, I am talking about, was rather positive since I actually invited my grandfather to come to us and live with us. This letter also included topics like how I would one day buy a piece of land near my grandfather’s place and build a house on it so that I would never really need to stay away from him. If I remember correctly, this was probably the longest letter that I had ever written to someone up and until that point.  After all, it had taken me at least about 6 hours to organize my thoughts and transfer them onto my letter pad!\n\nAnd, after writing that letter, I felt like I had finally managed to express my frustration (“anger” probably should be the right word here) to my grandfather. Besides, I also felt a bit excited while writing it since I was hoping that my grandfather would actually listen to my plea and come to live with us soon."

    "Answer": "With the invention and popularity of email and text messaging, letter writing has already lost its popularity. Nowadays people either text or call someone to convey a message rather than writing a letter and posting it. The letter I will talk about is the one I wrote to my younger sister Emma. It was about 4 years ago and I wrote it as a reply to a letter she wrote me. I would like to mention that I have written many other letters to friends and family members after I wrote this letter to Emma. However, the letter that I wrote to Emma was different than other letters.\n\nIt was a personal letter that mostly expressed my love for my family, how much I was missing them and how I was doing in my new school. Just after I moved to a new city and started my class, I received a beautiful letter from my younger sister who was only 12 years old at that time. In her letter, she wrote how much she missed me and how things were different for her without me being near her. She also mentioned how my friends were doing and how sad my parents were during the first few days of my departure. She wrote that my mother was particularly sad without having me around. She also asked me to write back as soon as possible with every detail of my new life and academic progress as my parents instructed her.\n\nI wrote a reply letter to Emma and let her know how much I loved her and how deeply I was missing all of them. I also wrote about my new school, teachers, classmates, and about the hostel I was staying in. I tried to give her a vivid description of everything so that she could visualise the details I wrote about. It was a large letter and took me around a couple of days to finish. I did not give details of my struggle and sad moments as that would have worried them a lot. I mentioned about my study, food and health condition to assure them that I was fine.\n\nMoving to a new city and adjusting there is a difficult experience. Personal touch with family is quite essential during this time and the letter I wrote and the one I received from Emma and my parents helped me to reduce my stress and depression level. Writing a letter to someone we care about is always important and this particular letter was even more important for me to write as my sister and other family members must have been eagerly waiting to receive it. I felt quite happy after I wrote and posted the letter."

    "Answer": "Pursuing a higher education is a blessing for people of a country like South Africa. In that consideration, I am lucky enough to expect that chance of higher study abroad. Recently I have applied for an MA programme at the University of Liverpool.\n\nWhile browsing the website of different universities, I found that the University of Liverpool is offering a research-based Master’s programme. So, I applied for it. By the same time, I had to write a letter to the Dean of the Institute of Psychology Health and Society to allow me attending the research course on Socio-Economic Factors in Health, Illness and Wellbeing. In fact, this was a one-year research-based MA programme of the university and I was able to fit with the course with my academic background.\n\nMr William Parkinson is the dean of the department and his approval is required for attending the course or get admitted to the department. So, I wrote the letter to him informing about my competencies on the course. Besides, I also had to answer some preset questions and elaborated the answers in my letter. Moreover, I described the importance of the course in the context of my country and its prospects and the other relevant issue. I was instructed to submit the answers in a handwritten format. So, I wrote a letter describing the necessary points and had sent it to the following address.  \n\nGetting admission to a foreign university is not so easy as it appears by the consultation with the foreign education councillors. It requires necessary documents and simultaneously the applicant needs to attain the minimum qualification to apply for the admission. I had to analyse each of my qualifications and collect all the scorecards so far I have achieved in my academic career. Moreover, the admission instruction asked me to provide all the copies of my academic results, and then write a letter to the dean of the department. After gathering all the necessary documents, I wrote the letter. In fact, without the letter, it was impossible to submit the application to the university. The instructions clearly stated that a letter should be submitted to the dean of the faculty and a scanned copy of the letter should be attached to the application form. So, I had to write the letter.\n\nIt was an exciting experience for me. In fact, I have not written many letters in my life and it was a lengthy one. Moreover, I had to be thoughtful while writing the letter. The letter contained all the academic credentials of my life which I hardly evaluated when I was an undergraduate student. Besides, collecting the necessary documents was also hard for me. I am a careless boy. I like to keep things in a mess. So, it was difficult for me to sort out the documents and prepare them to be sent in the UK. Finally, I completed all the tasks perfectly, though it took more time. Right before the deadline ended, I sent the letter to the university address. I am waiting for their response and hope I would get the chance to this research-based master’s programme of the University of Liverpool."

    "Answer": "I spent a significant part of my life in a village when growing up as a child, and because of this, I always feel a strong and special connection with villages, especially my own village, even though now, I have to live in a city.\n\nBut, the reason for which I brought the subject of having a strong connection with the village is that I like to visit my village whenever I get a chance in order to meet my close relatives like my uncles, cousins and aunts who are still living there. Another special incentive for me to visit my village is that I get to drink fresh coconut water from our own coconut palm trees.\n\nOf course, it is not like I visit my village to drink some fresh coconut water or something, but whenever I visit my village, I do make sure that I am drinking as much fresh coconut water as possible while I am staying there. So, I tried to do the same about a couple of months ago, meaning cutting fresh, young, green coconuts from the trees and drink its water except, of course, the ladder, my relatives used to climb the coconut palm trees, was looked to be a bit too old and weak for my liking. Therefore, I just didn’t want anybody to take the risk of using that weak looking ladder to climb the trees, as high as about 40 feet, and injure himself by having an accident.\n\nOf course, some of my cousins insisted that the ladder was going to be just fine, but I requested them to go to a good neighbour of ours to borrow his ladder. The neighbour was more than happy to loan his ladder to us.\n\nWell, the first thing that crossed my mind about borrowing that ladder from a neighbour was that it is quite a privilege to have such good neighbours who can help.  The second thing, which I felt, was that I needed to be careful with his ladder lest it gets damaged."

    "Answer": "Almost two years ago I had to borrow a rice cooker from one of my neighbours. Her name was Catherine and she was a very good person. She lived next to our house with her husband Alfred and three beautiful children. She was a full-time mom and I liked her amiable behaviour and genuine smile.\n\nI do not cook that often but one day when my younger sister and two of her friends came to visit us, I planned to prepare the lunch myself. When I was in the middle of my cooking preparation, I found that pour rice cooker was not functioning. I had no idea that it was out-of-order. Only then I knocked on Catherine’s house and requested her to lend me her rice cooker. In fact, Catherine had two rice cookers and that’s why it was not a problem for her to lend me one. As far I knew Catherine, she would have lent me her rice cooker even if she had only one of it.\n\nI was really confused when I decided to ask Catherine to lend me her rice cooker. I really needed it to finish my cooking, especially when my sister and her friends were waiting for lunch. This was the first time for me to ask something from Catherine. You can understand my dilemma about borrowing it. On the one hand, I needed it badly and on the other hand, I was quite confused about lending it from one of my neighbours. I was thinking if Catherine rejects my request, it would be quite embarrassing for me. However, finally, I felt totally relieved when Catherine lent me her rice cooker and I returned it just after I was finished with my cooking. Catherine seemed quite surprised but I explained that I did not want to use it more than once. She was laughing and assured me that I should ask her for anything I need without any hesitation.\n\nThe rice cooker that I borrowed from Catherine was manufactured by Philips and was one of the latest models. I liked it very much and in a few days, I bought a similar model for us."

    "Answer": "Sadly, I had to borrow some money from one of my neighbours last month to cover the medical treatment of my grandmother. In fact, I was helpless at that moment and the situation compelled me to borrow the money.\n\nMy grandmother is an asthma patient. She lives with my family. She is around 78 and requires medications to control her respiratory disorder. Often it happens that she forgets to take the medicines for her old age complications. Besides, she does not ask for medicines if they are finished. So, we have to remain careful about such issues. Suddenly, she felt sick and I had to hospitalise her. Unfortunately, my parents were not at home. So, I with my younger brother took her to the nearest hospital and to meet the initial expenses, I had to borrow the money.\n\nMr Abhinanda is my neighbour and lives in the next door of the house we live in. He is really a helpful person and tries to help everyone in their troubles. He is an engineer and works with the government of Nepal. Without having any other options, I knocked at his door and fortunately, I found him. I described the situation to him and asked him for some recommendations in this situation. In fact, my parents were absent. Both of them are teachers and had gone to attend a conference of teachers in Sri Lanka. They were set to return in the next week. Though they had managed everything, it was impossible for me to take care. So, I was unable to handle the situation for my young age. As a result, I sought help from Mr Abhinanda.\n\nI made a phone call to the local hospital and they suggested me to hospitalise the patient. My grandmother was having serious troubles in breathing. Her heartbeat slowed down. Actually, she had not been taking her medicines from last day as the medicines were finished. So, the situation deteriorated and needed emergency breathing service. But taking a patient to a hospital requires some formalities, time and most importantly money to pay the charges. I had no extra money with me to take her to the hospital. Basically, we had no idea that the situation will be so extreme. If the grandmother had told me before that she needs medicines, I would have arranged for them. So, being helpless, I had to borrow the money from my neighbour.  \n\nI am an introvert in nature and feel shy to ask for any help to anyone about any issues. So, it was not a happy event for me to seek help from my neighbour for my grandmother’s sickness. In fact, I really felt shy to ask for the money. But I had no other options left. If I did not ask for money on that day, I think I could have lost my grandmother. She was taken to the hospital emergency and the doctors provided her with oxygen to smoother her breathing. Then they pushed some vaccine and arranged for saline. Her nerve turned so weak that she was unable to speak with anyone. However, though I felt nervous for the situations including the money lending, finally I got my grandmother back, and I am happy with that. This was a different kind of experience for me."

    "Answer": "My country, has many, many street markets or open-air markets all over the place which are visited by hundreds of thousands of people every day in order to meet their daily needs. Today, I would like to talk about one of these open-air markets which I really enjoyed visiting about a few years ago.\n\nThe market, I am talking about, was located in a very old town and in the farthest north-western part of my country. Situated by one of the largest rivers of my country, it used to (and I am sure, it still is) be considered as a “business hub”, by thousands of people who live in that area and beyond.\n\nOccupying an area of almost 3 square kilometres, I think that this certainly is one of the largest street markets of my country. In fact, this open-air market is so busy and popular among the people that a significant number of people (or rather “wholesalers”) actually come to this a day ahead of the scheduled “market day” with their products and merchandises so that they can find a suitable location to conduct their business activities.\n\nHowever, even though, pretty much all kinds of items of our daily needs can be bought and sold in this busy street markets, this undoubtedly is aimed for mainly those farmers and businesses who want to buy and sell paddy and rice. In fact, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to suggest that this market is the perfect meeting place for all the wealthy farmers who either want to buy or sell their main “cash crops” (i.e. rice and paddy).\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed visiting the street market because I actually got to talk to so many different kinds of people from different backgrounds, and yet they were so friendly when doing business deals with each other. I also enjoyed visiting this place because I had never really enjoyed such a beautiful of the river where rows upon rows of boats were floating and carrying fresh produces, stacked one upon another in a beautiful manner."

    "Answer": "I was a bit stumped when I saw the topic on this cue card!  It’s been ages and ages since I’ve been to a ‘proper’ open-air street market.  Where I live in England the weather isn’t that great, so the fashion for completely open-air markets has passed.  We do have specialist monthly farmer’s markets that pop from time to time, but they tend to be just selling quite expensive luxury items. Speciality home-cured meats and home-made cheeses, all very delicious but too pricey for me to shop there. I could talk about one of those, but it would feel fake because I don’t really enjoy going to those, rather I just feel frustrated because I can’t afford to buy anything on sale there! Instead, I am going to tell you about my memories of a more authentic open-air market from my childhood.\n\nI’ll tell you where the market was, what it sold, how big it was and why I enjoyed going there so much when I was little.\n\nSo the market was about a mile away from my childhood home, and was held in a place called Kingston upon the Thames.  I didn’t know it then, but in fact, Kingston is a really ancient market town. It was of particular prominence as a trading centre because of its geographic location at a river crossing point as well as the boundary of some ancient territories. Depending on who you believe, it has a history that goes back for more than a thousand years, which is impressive in anyone’s calculations surely! So about 45 years ago, I would go to the Kingston market with my mum to do our weekly shop there. We’d usually walk, or sometimes cycle, locking our bikes up carefully at the end of a bridge before crossing the river on it to get to the market. It was a thriving, noisy and busy place. There were seemingly countless market stalls which sold predominantly food items. Lots of different fruit, vegetable and flower stalls competed to attract the attention of passers’ by to buy their goods. Because we went every week we were wise to any bad practice, and knew which stallholders could be trusted to supply quality goods and not over-charge us. I learned from an early age you should always watch the stall holder select produce from the display at the front of the stall – if they did it out of sight from the back you might end up with bruised or over-ripe produce. I also learned to haggle – which doesn’t happen so much anymore nowadays, but was acceptable even commonplace then. Also, I knew to always check the contents of the brown paper bags that were handed over to make sure the quality of fruit and veg was acceptable before paying for it in full! As well as the fruit and veg, there’d be other items. Household goods, ‘cheap and cheerful’ clothes and even impromptu ‘auctions’ of bargain scents or potions. It was a busy, heaving stimulating place. The gutters would be full of discarded fruit and veg, and sometimes I’d go and pick up these cast-offs at the end of the day as they were good food for our pet guinea pigs at home!\n\nThe market extended throughout the whole of the town centre, with different stalls selling the same types of things grouped close together. All the fruit was in a part of the town known as ‘The Apple Market’ for example. The area of streets it used to occupy is still called that now, but the open-air stalls with the colourful-striped canvas tops have long since gone, replaced with gentrified boutique shops selling rather more upmarket goods. Other areas had clothes stalls grouped together, you could pick up pairs of socks and pants for practically nothing. They weren’t good quality, but good enough for the price. Nowadays the market in Kingston does still take place, but is very much reduced in size, it is more likely to sell ‘posh’ food like expensive artisan bread; imported luxury olives and exclusive handbags. In my youth, it was a functional place to shop. You could pick up good value, fresh produce in season, and trudge home laden with bags of potatoes, plastic coat-hangers and other commonplace items.\n\nBecause the produce on sale was always what was currently in season, what was available varied week by week. Ripe strawberries in the summer were a particular treat!  However, one outing was a great tradition for us all as a family at Christmas. Once a year about a fortnight before Christmas Day, me, my brother and my sister would go with my Dad to choose a Christmas tree from one of the many stalls selling them in time for the festivities. We would carefully select one that was just the right height and amount of bushiness, and then all four of us would hold on to a bit of the tree to carry it the mile home together in a little crocodile line together. We probably looked quite sweet and festive all wrapped up in our bobble hats with thick scarves and gloves!\n\nSo I enjoyed visiting the market because it was such an assault on the senses. The crowds, smells and sights had a great atmosphere. The piles of fresh fruit and vegetable looked amazing, and there were many colourful characters calling out to sell their wares. You could also pick up some extraordinary bargains at the end of the day if you were smart, and could risk waiting to make a last-minute purchase. Stallholders needed to shift items before they went off, and/or didn’t really want to pack them all up again at the end of the day, sometimes it was easier for a market trader to just to sell things ‘for a song’. Occasionally I’d get a huge bunch of flowers for some trifling sum and feel a real sense of achievement carrying them home knowing I’d got myself a bargain!\n\nOpen-air markets are very different now, well it is in Kingston-upon-Thames at least. I’m glad I have my memories of the original one, though perhaps I romanticise it a bit. I daresay stallholders wouldn’t get away with cheating their customers by choosing stock from the back anymore, and the choice of products from all over the world is tempting, those have to changes for the better. Even so, I still think we have maybe lost something with the sanitising of the open-air market. It is undoubtedly better for health and hygiene, but I used to love darting round the back of the stalls to scoop up discarded cabbage leaves and manky carrots to take home to my pets! I suppose the progress is good, but it’s fun to remember past times too! I enjoyed those visits, and stored up some memories of what a ‘proper’ open-air market should be like, with a character and surprise around every corner. I like to think there are still places in the world still were such anarchic and crowded markets still take place week in week out and canny traders and shoppers sport with one another to secure the best deals!"

    "Answer": "Shopping is fun when it is done in a street market. I am happy that I had the chance to shop some special stuff from Temple Street in Hong Kong, China last year.\n\nI am an Italian businessman and love to travel. Annually I take a tour in different parts of the world. Last year, I went to China and travelled different parts of the country. Hong Kong appeared as one of the most prominent cities of the country with a special sort of appeal. The nightlife and the street markets are the keys to the appeal, I think. The market is near to the Jordan Subway station and easily accessible from any parts of the city. This is an enjoyable place to browse a large number of goods and have them after a beautiful haggling with the sellers.    \n\nTemple Street is a large street in Hong Kong and minly famous for street shops. The entire location is covered with crowds – mostly sellers and buyers. The market allows people to pass their time by checking the right goods for them. It sells a large number of goods and products and at lower prices. If you want to buy the products from a shopping mall, you are to pay more than the usual price. So, the locals and tourists from home and abroad come here to get their shopping done. The market is filled with plenty of clothes, foods, toys, dresses for men, women and children, crockeries, wristwatches, CDs, footwear, cookware, handicrafts, tea sets, glasses, antiques, electronic goods, pieces of jewelry, jackets and much more. Besides, the food stalls also sell traditional Chinese foods to fill the hunger of tired shoppers.     \n\nThis was a moderately large market covering around 600 meters. In fact, this was a night market that began in the evening. The shops are settled in rows and there are ample spaces before the shops to move and walk. There were large lights hung in almost every shops to exhibit the products. Almost all the sellers want to trick with foreign customers. They claim more price than the usual whenever any foreign tourist visits their shops. Besides, the car parking of the market is also filled with some other people playing music around the hours. The food stalls are located in a corner and some of the food vendors had set their stalls wherever they have got an empty space. Despite being a large market, it always crowded as a good number of people come to visit the stalls.  \n\nI have never experienced such a street market. As an Italian, it was kind of new experience for me. But I had the idea that I need to bargain, and finally, I was right about the assumption that the sellers are trying to cheat with the customers about the price of the goods and services. So, if the buyers are not serious in bargaining, they are to incur a huge loss. Even sometimes, the sellers try to sell some fake products logoed with renowned brands. This issue also needs consideration of the buyers. I bought some clothes and ornaments at a reasonable price after lots of arguments with the sellers. But I really enjoyed the snacks and traditional foods of the market. It was a pleasant experience for me indeed."

    "Answer": "I like to try new things every now and then in order to make my life a bit more interesting. But, I never really thought that horse riding would be one of them, and I still can’t believe that I actually did it! Anyway, here is how my horse riding story unfolded.\n\nIt was about 3 years ago when I went to visit a good friend of mine in the countryside. It was my first visit my friend’s place, so I didn’t really know what I was exactly supposed to expect there. Of course, as soon as I arrived there, about 200 kilometers away from my hometown, I was really impressed with the beautiful nature of the countryside. Equally impressive was the fact that some farmers there actually used to raise some beautiful looking horses which I never really thought that those farmers could have ever afforded.\n\nSo, when I asked my friend about how those farmers ended up having such beautiful looking horses, he told me that a group of wealthy farmers had been living in that countryside for generations who just loved to ride horses. In fact, I saw someone riding a horse one morning. After seeing this, I also became interested in horse riding. So, I asked my friend if he also knew how to do it. As soon as he said “yes”, I told him to borrow a horse from one of his farmer neighbours and teach me horse riding. However, my friend told me that I couldn’t possibly learn it just like that, but I could ride a horse with him, sitting as a passenger behind him. So, I just obliged and rode the horse for the next 15 minutes with my friend.\n\nAnyway, this activity was completely new for me, I never had a chance to touch a horse before, let alone riding one! Besides, the fact that we are still using the term “horsepower” to describe the power of a 'car engine' or 'machine' made me really wonder how “elite” of an animal it really is."

    "Answer": "I know what to tell you about here! I’m going to tell you all about what I did, where and when it was, who I shared the activity with and why it was both new and exciting for me.\n\nI love trying new things. I’m not particularly brave, but I hate missing out on adventures, and I am curious about the world. On balance, even if something is uncomfortable, or positively frightening, I’d much prefer to ‘give it a go’ and face the consequences than walk away from the opportunity and wonder what might have been.\n\nLast year I went on holiday to a fitness boot camp. It was in Northumberland, right by the sea. This is a wild and beautiful location in the north of England. The week involved lots of different activities, abseiling; hill walking; river kayaking; climbing (I was rubbish at that); bodyboarding; orienteering even learning how to build wild shelters out of scraps of wood. Lots of those activities were new and/or exciting, but there was one thing in particular we did that gave me a massive adrenalin high! Coasteering! Now I’d never even heard of this before, so I think you might also need me to explain a bit more about what exactly it is!\n\nEssentially coasteering is a cross between orienteering and coastal (ocean) swimming. The activity involves exploring a rocky coastline from the sea, by climbing, jumping, and swimming along its edge. It is quite strenuous, and you have to be brave as you are moving along the coast in an inter-tidal area with ocean currents, tides and hidden rocks to contend with. It isn’t just clambering over rock pools, nor is it swimming as such it is something in between. With the cold rough waters of the North Sea, it is an activity it would be far too dangerous to do on your own. You need to be with a group and a leader who knows the area and what is safe and what is not.\n\nSo the activity was coasteering, the location was Northumberland, and the timing was August 2015 I think. In terms of who I shared this with, well, I went out with a group of about 6 other fellow holiday-makers and our very experienced, patient and lovely guide Bruce. We all wore full wetsuits and old trainers to protect our feet as well as life jackets (buoyancy aids) and helmets. Even so, I was very apprehensive as we walked over the slippery seaweedcovered rocks towards the crashing waves. The first challenge was just climbing into the water as the waves seemed huge and the water was freezing. However, once you have literally taken the plunge, the shock of adrenalin and the effect of the wetsuit soon warms you up! Our leader was very safety conscious thankfully, so although I was a bit scared (I’m not all that strong a swimmer) in fact he carefully checked each route before we followed, using a rope to link us all together where necessary. As the time passed we got ever more confident, at times the waves washed us off rocks like we were droplets being shaken off the coat of a wet dog, but after a bit, you start to realise that even though you feel like you are being tossed around in a giant washing machine it is actually pretty safe. The buoyancy aid makes it impossible to sink, and as long as you don’t fight the currents, but go with them, it is really fun. You do have to surrender control to some extent which feels weird and unsettling but once you do, oh my what a ride! It was incredibly exciting. You are seeing the landscape (coastline in this case) from a really new perspective, in amongst the waves, gazing up at huge rocky cliffs, jumping in and out of rock pools, and screaming with laughter as you are swept along. Without the necessary equipment and guidance, it would be terrifying, you’d end up drowning, or injuring yourself by being battered against the rocks but this way it was enormous fun.\n\nSo coasteering was new and exciting because it was something I’d never even heard of before, let alone experienced. I had no idea at all what to expect. It was exciting because it moves you out of your comfort zone. Your heart is racing and it is a physical as well as a mental challenge to keep on going. However, it was also incredibly enjoyable and rewarding. Because we were a small group we all encouraged one another and pulled together, it was a great way to make new friends. I’m not sure it would suit everyone as a team-building activity in the workplace but I guarantee it would be effective!\n\nAlthough it was hilarious, it was challenging.  I’m really, really glad I did it, once. However, I don’t know if I’m quite brave enough to do it again! That said, I’ve already admitted I do have a terrible fear of missing out, so I think I probably would!  You should too, if you ever get the chance, but please make sure you trust your guide first, and don’t even think about it without proper equipment, it would be all too easy to get swept away, the oceans are a powerful force, and not to be trifled with!  It is being in amongst all that power of nature that made the experience so awesome and memorable!"

    "Answer": "To avoid boredom and monotony in life, I, along with my three other college friends planned to have a camp out in Mather Campground located in Grand Canyon of Arizona. Accordingly, we planned and made the camp out a grand success.\n\nIn fact, it is really intolerable to continue with academic studies, going to college, preparing assignments and again planning for the college the next day. So, I needed a perfect break from everything. Hence, the idea of camping out of home peeped in my mind. I placed the proposal to my close buddies and they also agreed with me. But it was difficult to prepare for everything and arrange leave for camping. But finally, we managed everything including permission from our parents, college and started for the campground by driving my Mazda 6. The experiences were really enjoyable for us.    \n\nIn the mid of the last October, we planned for the campout. Actually, in this last quarter of the year, there are huge pressures on us for completing the courses and appear in the final exams. To get rid of all the monotonous events, we decided to camp out. Initially, we wanted to set the camp in the garden in front of my residence. But the idea was not supported by others. Then we decided to move to the Grand Canyon national park. Accordingly, we hired a spot at the camping venue. Then we arranged for the necessary things. In fact, we wanted to spend a life leaving the modern city behind us. So, we did not take our cell phones, laptops and other electronic gears with us. We started for the Mather Campground and it was nearly a half-day drive from our city.    \n\nGeorge, Robert, and David accompanied me on this camping trip. We all were excited and had different plans to execute at the campground. But we also experienced some troubles from our parents before we start. Actually, none of them allowed us to live outside the home. They did not agree with the idea of leaving the cell phones at home. Later, we had a meeting at my home and decided to take the help of a friendly lecturer of our college. I think our parents were worried about our safety and security in the campsite. So, it was really difficult for us to make them understand that we can take care of ourselves. Besides, Mr Johnson, the lecturer of college, also played an important role here. Finally, everything was set and we began the journey.     \n\nThis was a new experience for and for my friends as well. Neither had we seen the Grand Canyon before nor had we experienced a night out of our home. So, it was really thrilling. Moreover, the weather was good and comfortable. We had a barbeque set with us. So, we caught some trout from a nearby water body and had a wonderful dinner with the fried fishes. Though there were cottages and tents for sleeping at night in the campground, we had our own sleeping bags. Besides, we only had a radio set which was the link between us and the civilisation we left behind. The sky was clear and filled with bright stars. They appeared to so close enough that we could have touched them with hands. The entire environment was natural and extremely enjoying. Hence, it was a remarkable experience for me and others."

    "Answer": "Thank you for choosing this nice cue card topic for me. The country, in which I live, indeed has seen a great number of people who have worked tirelessly to help others. Today, I would like to talk about one such person who essentially has become the epitome of philanthropy and philanthropic activities in my country.\n\nThe person, I am talking about, is very popularly known as “Haji Mohammad Mohsin” in my country. Born in the year of 1733 AD, Haji Mohammad Mohsin was one of the greatest Muslim personalities of undivided Bengal in British India. He is known as a great philanthropist and educationist of Bengal. In fact, he is such a popular figure in Bangladesh that whenever somebody does something good to help other people, they start to compare him or her with the “great” Haji Mohammad Mohsin.\n\nAnyway, He was one of the wealthiest men in the area as he possessed huge properties in Hooghly, Nadia in today's Bengal (a province of India which has a border with Bangladesh) and in Khulna and Jessore in today's Bangladesh.  \n\nI know about this person, primarily from the educational sources, like schools and books. In fact, it was a part of our course curriculum to learn about such great persons of our country. I came to learn about him also through some discussions on our television channels.\n\nThis great philanthropist dedicated all the income – yes, all of his income - from his property for charity and social and educational causes. He particularly helped the starved and destitute during the great famine of Bengal in 1776-77 which had saved the lives of thousands of people. Besides, he established many schools and colleges to offer free education for the poor and unprivileged, in addition to building many places for worship. However, the most significant aspect of this great person was that even though, he was one of the wealthiest few persons of undivided India, he earned his living by sewing caps and calligraphy of the holy Quran."

Of course, all of these things are incredibly important, impressive and of course helpful. And today, I’ll tell you about a person I know about who I believe has helped a lot of people.\n\nSo the person is known locally as The Mohican Runner, he lives in my home city of Sheffield. To be quite honest, when I first spotted him it was simply because he has a very distinctive look. He is quite lean and athletic and a talented runner, so a fast and furious participant in many local races. However, what makes him stand out is that he has a well sculptured Mohican haircut. It’s a punk style where the sides of his head are shaved, and then he has a distinctive central strip of long hair down the middle.\n\n His arms are heavily inked with various geometric designs, other shapes are marked on his shaved head and legs. If you just saw him, it is possible that you might feel quite intimidated by him at first glance, but once you know his story you will realise you shouldn’t be. Rather you should approach him and congratulate him and shake him by the hand.\n\nBecause The Mohican Runner runs and lives locally, I saw him around a lot. He, like me, is a regular attendee at my local Saturday morning 5 km parkrun. (Though unlike me he always finishes near the front!) About a year ago, I found out that he was setting himself some running challenges to raise money for some children’s charities. This caught my attention. Not content with seeking sponsorship for doing a single event, The Mohican Runner set himself the challenge of running a half-marathon every month for 13 months, the following year it was to run a race every weekend for a year. The challenges are in themselves impressive, but also not the point. It turns out that what drove this fundraising addiction was his own personal experience. He was himself the victim of really horrific physical child abuse when he was growing up. He was isolated, bullied and vulnerable. He was only able to escape his situation when certain charities got involved and intervened and he was then removed from his family. His story was so extreme it was used as the basis of a UK-wide funding appeal for a national charity.\n\nHis fundraising achievements are extraordinary, his story and efforts have raised somewhere around £1.3 million, which is an amazing sum of money. However, I believe it isn’t just that he has helped people through fundraising. I believe by being courageous enough to tell his story he reminds everyone of how important it is to be alert to the often hidden problem of child abuse. I think what he does is helpful beyond measure because even without the fundraising, he is giving a voice to a section of society that is often completely powerless and without a voice to represent them at all. There are few things more powerful than hearing someone talk from personal experience. I think it must take extraordinary courage to tell and retell a painful story that I’m sure you would much prefer to be able to forget.\n\nSo to conclude, I think the Mohican Runner has done an enormous amount to help people, in particular children who are victims of physical and sexual abuse who perhaps we would rather pretend weren’t there because their plight is hidden and it seems so impossible to comprehend and hard to help. He has helped by raising money; he has helped by making his own story public and he has helped by being a role model. He should be recognised for what he has done for others.  If you ever come to Sheffield do look out for him, you’ll spot him sooner or later I’m sure, he’s hard to miss, and he’s seemingly ‘always’ out and about, clocking up the miles, putting in the training and powering on for his favoured charities."

    "Answer": "After being matured I came to know about lots of people who spent their entire life for humanity. Among them, the contributions of Mother Teresa undoubtedly are more than any other one.\n\nIn her life, Mother Teresa was a Roman Catholic nun and missionary. She had spent her entire life to caring for the poor and destitute.  She passed a notable part of her life in India and was moved by the pathetic condition of the people living in the streets. So, she established some of the shelter homes for them in different parts of India. She is also the founder of Missionaries of Charity, and this is a Roman Catholic religious group that helps the people in distress with all sorts of facilities including the arrangement of their medical treatment, rehabilitation etc. for free of cost.   \n\nMother Teresa was born on August 26 in 1910 in Skopje which is now the capital of the Republic of Macedonia. She was named as Agnes which resembled the little flower. Her father was a politician and she was the youngest of all the children. Her parents had met from two separate villages. Unfortunately, she lost her father at the age of eight. In her early childhood, she preferred to listen to stories of missionaries, their activities to reduce the grief of the people in different parts of the world. When she turned 12, she decided to devote her life to the humankind and when she was 18, she left home to join Sisters of Loreto. She had never met her family members again in her life after she left the home.\n\nMother Teresa did a lot of humanitarian works in her life. She learnt different languages to communicate directly with people in the Indian sub-continent. She played the role of a teacher in schools to teach students about numerous issues. She turned into a nun in 1931, and selected a name which she had to alter the spelling for another nun had the same name with the same spelling. She served for around 20 years at Loreto convent school in Calcutta. But the poorness, ill conditions and deaths of the poor people disturbed her seriously. So, she planned to help the distressed. Accordingly, she arranged for opening some shelters in Calcutta to help them. Nirmal Hriday is one of her shelters where the poverty-stricken, ill-fated people can have their treatments for some specific diseases and it is for free.  \n\nShe is a motherly figure in the world and has been admired even after her death. She is mostly famous for her charitable works and Missionaries of Charities which comes in helping of the destitute across the world. In her lifetime, she was awarded numerous prizes and in 1979 she won the Noble Prize in Peace. But some of her activities were under criticism like the hospitals she ran received a huge amount of donations but on the contrary, the service quality did not improve at all and there were shortages of medical care. Her life has been the subject of literature, documentaries and films. She has been portrayed as an affectionate character who served humanity with great care and love. She really was an admirable woman of the world."

    "Answer": "My country, Bangladesh, has a rather rich history and heritage.  In fact, many buildings and architectural sites of this country bear testimony to this fact. So, today, I would like to talk about one such historical building which may not be as old as many other buildings of my country, but it certainly is no less significant as far as the history of my country is concerned.\n\nThe building is famously known as “Curzon Hall”. Named after Lord Curzon, the then-viceroy of British India, this historical building was built in the year of 1904.\n\nIt was initially intended to be used as a town hall, after the partition of Bengal in 1905, the building started to be used as a part of Dhaka college campus, one of the few best and most prominent educational institution for higher studies in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) up and until that point. And later when Dhaka University was formed in 1921 the building became a part of the science faculty of the university.\n\nIts massive structure acts as a beacon for the strength and solidarity of education in this country. By the way, the name of Lord Curzon and opening the door to higher education in Bangladesh are synonymous since it is Mr Curzon who helped establish the Dhaka university which also happens to be the first university for the then East Bengal. So, from that point of view, Curzon hall certainly played a very significant role in shaping the educational history of Bangladesh.\n\nAnyway, this historical building is known, primarily for two reasons: first one, of course, is that it has a mesmerizing architecture, and has a magnificent red colour without the use of red sandstones. The structure blends the unique style of European and Mughal architecture to combine traditional art with modern features, with beautiful Domes and exquisite horseshoes with ornamented brackets, deep eaves and domed terrace pavilions. Secondly, it played a very significant part in organizing the language movement of 1948 which eventually made “Bangla” the state language of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)."

    "Answer": "I live in England in the United Kingdom where we have a wealth of historic buildings. For this topic, I could take my pick from castles, to manor houses and even prehistoric stone circles! I am spoilt for choice in thinking about what historic structure to talk about. However, instead of telling you about one of our more obvious and famous places, I want to tell you about a little piece of living history that is near to where I currently live in Sheffield.\n\nI shall tell you what and where it is; and fill in as many details as I can about when it was built; why; what it is known for and describe it as best I can.\n\nI first came across this construction when I was exploring a woodland trail near to where I had just moved to in Sheffield after I had to relocate to this city for work. Hidden in amongst the trees, and next to a carefully constructed waterway where the narrow river seemed to have been diverted, was a humble-looking stone-built workshop of some sort. When I first discovered it, the building was very run-down, almost completely derelict. Although it was clearly part of the area’s industrial heritage, I had no idea what it was originally built for. It was overgrown with trees, brambles and ivy, and the wooden shutters on the windows were falling off and rotting away. Someone must have told me it was known locally as ‘The Shepherd Wheel’ but that made little sense. It didn’t seem to be in an area where sheep would be kept, and it seemed more likely it was for some sort of semi-industrial purpose, but what? So the building is ‘The Shepherd Wheel’ and it is in the woodland of the Porter Valley, in the south-west outskirts of the city of Sheffield. As to when it was built and why? - it took me a while to find this out!\n\nOver the course of the next couple of years, some money was made available by some sort of heritage trust, and a project commenced to return the building to its former glory. As part of the restoration project, some care was taken to put up signs explaining the history of the site, and eventually, I learned much more about it, and have been in to see the renovations, and even participated in some of the work to do so. Only last year I spent a morning volunteering on the project helping to paint the newly crafted wooden shutters on the windows, to protect them from the elements of driving rain.\n\nSo I can now tell you that this construction is connected to the knife-grinding industry for which Sheffield was once renowned. Even today Sheffield has a proud heritage of Sheffield Steel, and many of the buildings in the city are linked to the Steel industry and the work of ‘the cutlers’ who for some 400 years created fine knives, blades and other steel products. The building, is in fact, a surviving example of a cottage industry that was once widespread in the valley. Set in the picturesque valley of the Porter Brook, this Shepherd Wheel is a unique, now once again working example of Sheffield knife grinding industry. At one time there were many such small water-powered grinding workshops along Sheffield's rivers abut now this alone remains. I am told it is the earliest complete example of this industry with evidence dating it back to the 1500s. That is an extraordinary notion. That site has been worked for generations, a water wheel turning there since 1584 – or even earlier. It was mentioned in a will of that date when the wheel owner passed it to his sons, who knows how much further back in time something was first constructed on this site?\n\nFrom the outside, it is a single storey stone building, with windows at the side.  Inside is an open workshop that seems dark, despite the extent of the windows. However, at the side of the building, and this is what has now been restored to working order, is an enormous water wheel. Powered by the force of water diverted from the river to power the wheel, it turns, and through a clever mechanism provides the energy to power grit stones on which knives were sharpened as they rotated within the workshop itself.  Amazingly, the restoration project has managed to find photographs of people who worked in the Shepherd Wheel building toward the end of its time as a thriving industry, together with various tools and equipment that are now all on display. Pride of place is given to the two grinding hulls, grinding wheels and, of course, the waterwheel itself. It is a small working museum, staffed largely by volunteers. It is only open for a few days throughout the year, but well worth the visit.  On special days they will get the wheel turning, and give educational tours. You can begin to imagine how in this workshop, in dark, damp conditions, skilled grinders produced fine, sharp cutting edges. It was not until the 1930s that grinding ceased and the Wheel's pivotal role in Sheffield's cutlery industry ended, so this is relatively recent history, just about within living memory even though the site itself goes back for hundreds of years.\n\nI love this building, it is in a beautiful location, and has a solidity to it that pleases me. It is a link to our local industrial heritage. For those that worked there, the work was really hard. Back-breaking, and very dusty conditions with the blade on the grindstones generating lots of dust. I suppose that’s where the phrase ‘keeping your nose to the grindstone’ comes from, bent double over a wheel, knife grinders had to lean right into the gritstone to sharpen blades, sometimes even lying flat on their fronts, with their faces near the grindstone in order to hold the blades against the stone. Lovely as the building is, and important as the heritage is, it is perhaps unwise to romanticise the reality of what it would be like to work there. All the same, I’m so happy that people have made the effort to restore the works, it is important to remember how working life was for local people in times past"

    "Answer": "Sydney Opera House is a World Heritage Site, and a renowned building in Australia. I am glad that I got the chance to describe this famous building in my country, Australia. The building is also a wonder for the country.\n\nSydney Opera House is a venue mostly used for exhibiting performing arts. Now, this has become an iconic and historic building for the country. The building is located in Sydney Harbour. The Sydney business district is adjacent to the building. The building is also near to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and thus accessible almost from all the directions. The venue is used for several purposes together and hosts over 1400 performances annually. This is also one of the most visiting places in Australia and a notable number of people come to visit the structure.   \n\nThe initial plan to establish such a huge theatrical performance hall was adopted in the 1940s and with gradual development, the designing of the building was done in 1957 while the construction of the building started in 1958. The key aim of constructing the building was to create a unique facility where people can enjoy theatrical performances in a sophisticated environment. But the construction experienced some other troubles during its construction process and finally was opened in October of 1973 for the public. Now a wing of the New South Wales Government named the Sydney Opera House Trust runs the building. The building is covered with a series of concrete shells which appear uniformed from a distant view.   \n\nThe building is known for several reasons. Firstly, this is an important landmark for Australia that has been representing the country for years. The venue is mostly known for holding theatrical performances on its inside space. There are two large space and some smaller spaces inside the venue. One of the larger spaces is occupied by a concert hall inside the building. The seating arrangements inside the halls are done technically and the seats rise from the lower to the higher position so that the audiences could enjoy the shows and performances clearly. Sydney Opera House is also known for the Joan Sutherland Theatre, Drama Theatre, a Playhouse, a studio with 280 permanent seats, multipurpose venue for arranging parties, conferences and for arranging other functions and the recording studio.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House construction was completed in three stages. The site where the building is standing now was occupied by the Fort Macquarie Tram Depot and it was demolished before the construction of the Opera House. The building contains all the modern facilities to its visitors and even guided tours are also available here to know the building perfectly. The building has restaurants and cafes for ordinary visitors and even they can have a glass of drink as well sitting at the bar. Shopping is fun here on the retail outlets. The backstage tour is another popular aspect of the building and it shows the activities of the performers before the show begins. The concert hall can accommodate over 2500 audiences at a time."

    "Answer": "Well, I never really enjoy attending any meeting, \"period\". I didn’t like it when I was going to college, and I don’t happen to enjoy it now either at my work. But, of course, the world doesn’t really care what I think about attending a meeting and neither does my CEO boss. So, when he, my CEO that is, called for an urgent meeting about a year ago, I just didn’t have any other option but to oblige.\n\nThis meeting was held at the huge office chamber of my CEO. In fact, the office room is so huge that it could easily accommodate the seating arrangement of at least 50 people at the same time. And why couldn’t it?! After all, he was the owner and also the boss of one of the largest snack making companies of my country, with an annual business turnover of about US $30 million as well as almost 350 employees.\n\nHowever, after entering the office room of my boss, I could actually see only 12 or 13 people who were attending the meeting. Among them, the majority were the most senior-level managers and a few mid-level managers, including this poor me. Of course, I wasn’t really aware of the agendas of the meeting (usually only the most senior-level managers are notified about the meeting agendas at my work) in advance, but when the meeting actually started, I came to know that the boss was effectively thinking of raising the amount of annual bonus at the end of every year only for those employees who don’t ask for any extra time off other than the scheduled annual holidays and vacation time.  \n\nSo, what this meeting exactly had to do with my participation in it, or why I remember going to this meeting? Well, the answer is, I was the first employee to receive the additional amount of annual bonus because I was the one at my office who didn’t take any additional time off outside of the regular annual holidays and time off."

    "Answer": "Thank you, sir, for this nice and interesting topic. As I am a full-time employee in a large multinational company, attending or arranging meetings is a quite frequent event for me. But for this cue card topic, I would like to talk about a meeting I had with some of my classmates in my school.\n\nWe had this meeting at a public park which was located near our school. As far as I can recall, we went there after school was over. I was in my grade 7 at that time and we had this meeting to decide who should we nominate our class captain between Milton and Rifat. I think we had this meeting just before the day we were supposed to nominate our class leader. The meeting lasted for about one hour.\n\nAt least 7-9 of my classmates, who were very close friends and had a great bond, were present at the meeting. Ismail led the meeting and we wanted to come to a decision about the next day's captain nomination. In this group of 8-10 students, 2-3 were very close friends of mine. There were around 30 students in our class and all would be able to cast their votes for the class captain selection except the three who were candidates for the captain election. Since three students were competing for the election, 27 remaining students would be able to vote. As a group of about 10 students, our votes thus had been very crucial.\n\nThe first agenda of the meeting was to note down the pros and cons of Milton and Rafat as our class captain. Then the second issue was to score them both based on 20 criteria that we had already listed. After that, we let every one of us talk for 2 minutes to express his opinion. Our final agenda, the most important one, was to come to a decision point to choose a captain in favour of whom we will vote.\n\nWhy do I remember this meeting? - Well, this was probably the first important meeting I had in my life. The excitement of having a secret meeting that would influence greatly in deciding our class captain was overwhelming. Moreover, I felt like being an important part of this meeting since I proposed the idea of having this meeting. This meeting, in reality, greatly influenced the class captain selection the next day and we had our favourite captain, Milton, nominated! This whole event took place when I was only 12 years old. Due to my age, agenda for the meeting, our excitement for it, I still remember this meeting very vividly."

    "Answer": "Being an executive for a marketing company, it is really difficult to maintain schedules everywhere as the executive has to remain busy always. Still, I can remember the first annual meeting with this organisation where I am ranked with the senior marketing manager.\n\nThe meeting was held at around 12 pm and the participants were asked to be at the head office conference room at least 15 minutes before the meeting. But unfortunately, on the same day, I had to execute some other tasks at the same time. In fact, some of the clients asked me to visit them on that day and I was unable to avoid the requests as the customers are valuable to us. Thereby, I was unable to appear at the right time and informed the issue to my authority. The meeting agenda was about the annual sales and marketing planning, targets, ways to achieve the goals etc. for the upcoming year, promotion of the executives and so forth. So, all the marketing representatives were asked to attend the meeting.\n\nA large number of officials and executives were present at the meeting. The event began at the pre-set time and was presided over by the Chairman of the company. Almost all the invited guests were present there. The top officials and the board members were also present and took their seats in the first row. With the anchoring of the Managing Director, the agendas were discussed elaborately. Besides, the meeting was attended by the executives of all level (usually the junior executives were not allowed to attend such events but the trend has been changed considering some strategic issues of this annual planning). The meeting continued for the next two and a half hours and ended with a grand lunch.\n\nThere were lots of issues to be discussed at the meeting. It began with congratulating the newly elected board members, and the Chairman, in his speech, requested them to execute their respective responsibilities for the betterment of the company in their tenure. Then the annual planning issues were placed for discussion. Company’s overall progress was discussed as one of the key agenda. Though the company achieved a larger part of the previous year’s target, it was difficult reaching the entire goal. The human resource was a problem for the company and with the fresh recruitment, the company now aims to reach the set goals of this year and get a higher rank than last year. Among the other issues, the most notable are – the inclusion of new schemes of marketing strategies, ensuring the proper customer care and feedback, monitoring of the advancements and others.\n\nI have participated in many other meetings of the company but this one is particularly memorable to me. Firstly, I was late for the meeting as I had to complete some other official business and distribute responsibilities of my nine-member marketing team. So, I could not make my entry at the right moment. Besides, I missed the initial part of the meeting and had to check out the meeting minutes for that. I will remember the meeting for many days as I gave a speech at the meeting over my activities and presented the strategies for my team to achieve the goals within the limited time. Moreover, the company wanted me to play some additional roles for my special performance last season. So, they ranked me up with some benefits as well. For all such events, I remember the meeting."

    "Answer": "As a student of MA in Social Science at a university in New York, I passed some years in the USA. I had to work as a part-time sales executive at a local Samsung outlet to bear my expenses as I had no scholarships. I attended a strategic meeting there, and I will share my experience now.\n\nThe meeting was held in the afternoon at the outlet on a weekly holiday. I was asked to reach the outlet by the due time. The meeting was about setting up strategies for the increase in sales for that outlet. In fact, the other competitors selling similar products like Apple, Sony, Asus and others were having a very good business. So, the authority wanted us to increase our sales volume and wanted to set the right strategies for achieving the monthly sales targets. \n\nMy entire sales team and the higher executives of the company attended the meeting. An official from the Samsung headquarters was also sent here to instruct us on sales issues. They discussed different issues related to sales enhancing. I was present there with my part-time sales team while the other full-timers were also attended. In fact, the weekly leave was smashed by this meeting. So, almost everyone was restless in the beginning to get rid of it, but later when the serious issues appeared, they became active listeners and participated with their own thoughts. As a result, the meeting turned into a lively one and some effective strategies were discovered that helped us to move ahead successfully.         \n\nActually, the sales volume was lower in this particular Samsung outlet than the other outlets in the city. Most of the times, we failed to reach the monthly sales target. So, the authority was disappointed with our performance and services. They also alleged us that the sales representatives are unable to provide the right service to the existing and potential clients which are producing that poor sale volume. Accordingly, the instructions were delivered by the Samsung representative. The instructions were positive and meant for the success of the entire sales team. Besides, some additional recommendations were placed from our part in accordance with the potential situations.\n\nI remember the meeting for its importance. Basically, the moments were not positive for the outlet and it was unable to draw the attention of the clients to sell the products. The outlet used to sell different products from Samsung, basically mobile phones and computer monitors. The outlet owner had to undergo pressures from the authority when we failed to fill up the monthly sales target. Besides, the monthly sales had an impact on our salary as we were on a contract basis. As a result, such a strategic meeting was required to revive everything. I had the chance to share my idea and luckily the idea was accepted and helped a lot to generate revenue. For my contribution, I was awarded a handsome amount of money from the outlet. They implemented my idea for a long period. For all such reasons, I remember going to this meeting even today."

    "Answer": "It is indeed an interesting cue card topic as it gives me a wonderful opportunity to revisit my precious childhood memories again, involving my loving family and the people close to its members. Today, I would like to talk about one such people who was really a good friend of my family, especially, my father.\n\nThe person, I am talking about, was an old taxi driver. Of course, when I say that he was an old taxi driver, I don’t necessarily mean that he was as old as a senior citizen or something. Rather, what I meant is that he was older than my father. Now, I am not sure when or how my father exactly met this taxi driver, but I remember meeting him or talking to him for the first when he had come to pick me and my father up in order to take us to a doctor.\n\nBut, after meeting him on that day, I actually kind of started to like him since he somehow made me forget about my stomach pain with his pleasant personalities. Not to mention, since that day, this ever-smiling taxi driver, with his nicely groomed beard, has visited my home on numerous occasions, not only as a taxi driver to transport us to places but also as a family friend.\n\nIn fact, he used to visit my family at least once a week, either just to say hello to them or to offer them some fresh fruits or vegetables from his farms. By the way, this hard-working taxi driver didn’t just use to drive taxi to earn his living but also by growing fresh fruits and vegetables on his farmlands.\n\nI remember this person, mainly because he used to offer me all kinds of goodies and fresh fruits, just like a loving grandfather would give to his grandchildren. I remember him also because he had taken me to many interesting places, which a child would like to go to out of childish curiosity, in his taxi."

    "Answer": "Hmm, an interesting question. When I was growing up various friends of the family came and went, local shop-keepers were friendly but perhaps not truly ‘friends’ in the real sense of the word; neighbours were good fun but then moved away. The person I can think was around throughout my childhood, albeit intermittently. I’m going to try and explain to you who this person was as well as how it was we came to know them. The question about how often they visited our house is a bit tricky but doesn’t make them less of a friend, and finally, I’ll explain why it is this person made such a strong impression on me I remember them still.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I lived in a fairly suburban area. Once a year, for two weeks of the summer holidays, we’d all pile into the family car and drive for what seemed to me like an eternity to the English countryside of the far north – Northumberland. We always stayed in the same holiday cottage which was self-catering. It was on a mixed sheep/ cattle and arable farm, and our cottage was attached to the shepherd’s permanent home. He lived there with his wife and kept chickens at the end of his garden. The person who I want to tell you about is the shepherd. His name was Ronnie Shipley and to me, as a child, he was a magical figure.  \n\nBecause we holidayed there every year throughout my childhood, he got to know me and my whole family really well. His own children had long ago grown up and left home, and I think he liked having enthusiastic youngsters around who idolised him and were interested in his work. He would take us with him to feed the hens, show us where we could find the secretive diamond-backed adders in his garden. These are beautiful snakes, and the only venomous ones in the UK, but they are incredibly timid and difficult to spot. He would let us ‘help’ with the sheep, (I don’t think we were very helpful at all) but we swung on gates and cheerfully ran around herding them. He had a sheepdog that actually did all the work, but when I was very little I was none the wiser. When we were older he plonked us on to the back of the old farm pony and let us ride around the farm. On one memorable occasion, he even sat me on the back of a wonderfully tame but enormous Hereford bull. They are actually incredibly docile cattle, but I was still very impressed that I was able to do this.\n\nBecause he lived in Northumberland, and we lived down in the south of England just outside London hundreds of miles away, in fact, he never did visit our house. That seems a shame now I look back, but he loved his home in the north, and couldn’t see the point in visiting anywhere else. Also, I now realise that he was actually pretty old even then, way past usual retirement years, but carrying on doing the job he loved for as long as he could. I think a long journey by train would have been quite difficult for him.\n\nAs to why I remember this person, well he was such a wonderful magical figure from my childhood. It was as if he inhabited a parallel universe. He taught me to appreciate the countryside and the great outdoors. He was patient and kind with his time.  I remember him pointing out stars in the night sky – things that I could never see at home because of the light pollution from the urban area I lived in. He also looked very distinctive. He had a weather-beaten wrinkled face from working outdoors year-round for decades. He wore a flat cap and an old weathered tweed jacket, and always carried a shepherd's stick with him (which he’d made himself) and was accompanied by a collie dog to help him in his work. He must have taken a bit of a shine to our family, as he always welcomed us with warmth and genuine affection. We’d pop round for endless tea and coffee and shriek delightedly at the discoveries he revealed. In return, sometimes he’d come with us when we went off on a family outing to the seaside or some special place, trips out both he and his wife Annie much enjoyed.\n\nNow I’m long grown up and those holidays are a distant memory. Ronnie himself died years ago. However, I still have two sticks which he made just for me. One is a thumbstick – a very distinctive walking stick that you cut to the right length according to your own height and then walk with your thumb resting in the crook of a V formed where the stick has naturally divided. Mine was specially picked out by him for me. The other is a more traditional British shepherd’s crook. It is a hazel stick, with a sheep’s horn on the end. On the horn, he has carved my initials ‘L.M.’ together with the date 1978, so I know that I was 13 years old when he gave it to me. What a special treasure that is.\n\nIt’s funny, I was incredibly fond of Mr Shipley as I was growing up, but I took his attention and generosity a bit for granted, I think that’s easy to do when you are small. Now I’m older and wiser (hopefully) I think he is even more remarkable. We were just one of many families he must have met over the years and yet he always made us feel special.  He was a remarkable man and a great friend to all our family. I feel really blessed to have met him, and his legacy endures in very real ways. There is even a gooseberry bush in the garden of my parent’s house that is from a cutting he gave to them decades ago. I wonder if he had any idea how special he was, and how much his friendship meant to us all. I think above all else he gave us his time, and shared his stories, for me that was the best gift ever, as, with it, he stimulated my imagination and gave me happy memories, those can endure almost forever!"

    "Answer": "I was so lucky to have my aunt Sally with me during my childhood, and she still continues her bond with my family. In fact, she is my mom’s best friend, our neighbour - lives at the opposite door of our apartment in Canada.\n\nAunt Sally is a professional accountant and works as the Chief Accountant with an international organisation. She is my mom’s friend since their school days and they have been continuing the relationship even in their middle age. They are like twin sisters and love to share everything together. They share a very strong and enviable bond among them. Often they used to go for the outing together and also had their necessary things done together. I like aunt Sally much because she loves me like her own daughter. Even in these days, she helps me solve the accounting problems of my college.  \n\nMy mother met aunt Sally in her school. Both of them were at their elementary level. In fact, my grandpa admitted my mom to the local school for kids where all the kids had their elementary education. Gradually, the relationship between them started and they shared their home works, assignments etc. When they matured, the friendship between mom and aunt Sally deepened. The residence of aunt Sally was far from my grandpa’s house, and then both the families decided to make it closer to each other. It created the relationship between the two families and still, it is going on today. Both the families now have turned like a single-family. Accordingly, I got familiar with aunt Sally after being matured.  \n\nAunt Sally frequently visited our house. Since she is our neighbour, there are no specific schedules for her visit. It has happened that she comes to visit my mom even in the late hours of the night which made us surprised and shocked as well lest we are to listen to any bad news at that late night. On the other side, my mom was also similar to her. She also used to visit aunt Sally’s home frequently. As a result, the friendship has turned matured which is rare at this present age. Presently, visiting has become limited. She is now unable to manage time much to visit my mom for her occupational engagement. So, now she comes at least twice a week to visit my mom and us.\n\nI remember aunt Sally for some specific reasons. The first and the most important thing about her is that she is exceptionally smart and brilliant. She is able to solve even the toughest mathematical problems within a short time. She looks pretty with her bluish eyes and curly hair even in her 40s. She is also an amicable person who loves to chat with people. She loves kids and spends time with them. When I was a kid, she took much care for me with my mom. Both of them have endured lots of troubles for me in my early days as I was a naughty girl. Now I actually have less time to socialize with other people for my academic studies. But still, I seek help from aunt Sally if I am in troubles and she also manages time to spare with me."

    "Answer": "My friend, Robin, is essentially a party animal. In fact, he likes to party whether he wants to celebrate his birthday or just celebrate buying a new bicycle with the money which his grandfather gives him. But, the party, I attended and am going to talk about here, was organized by Robin for a more serious and formal reason, and the reason was to celebrate his new job.\n\nAnyway, Robin wasn’t just a party animal, but also somewhat a careless person when it had come to choosing a proper job or career. Of course, he would get a part-time job here and there, but he would stick to them only for a few months at maximum. However, this careless behaviour of Robin became a serious issue for his parents, so they actually forced him to find a real job. So, Robin, at least for once, gave his best shot to search for a real job. For that, he even went to a number of employment agencies to learn about the interview tips and also how to write a great resume/CV. Finally, after trying almost 6 months, Robin did find a real job, and that too as a Senior Officer at a very prestigious bank.\n\nNaturally, it was time for some party and Robin didn’t want to waste any time in doing it. So, he invited all of his friends, including me, to a nice restaurant to enjoy some great foods. The restaurant also had arranged live music for us. Apart from enjoying great foods and live music, we also had the opportunity to see the rare video of Robin in which he could be seen dancing for the first time at a high school party.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed pretty much everything about this party, but what I really enjoyed the most was the way how we all teased Robin for behaving like a “grown-up” person for the first time. Besides, I also liked the live music show which played some of my most favourite songs that I almost forgot about."

    "Answer": "Ooh, parties!  That conjures up so many different possibilities.  Children’s parties with jelly and ice cream and silly games like ‘pin the tail on the donkey’ when I was little, or more ‘serious’ celebratory reception parties after a wedding.  However, the most recent party I went to was neither of those things, and it was great!\n\nI’m going to tell you what it was about; where it was held; what people did during the party (which might be a bit unexpected) and explain what it was that I enjoyed about this party in particular.\n\nSo, the occasion was a birthday, but not for a person, for an event.  In the UK – and indeed in many other countries worldwide now, there is an organisation called 'parkrun'.  This umbrella group sets up free, inclusive running events all over the country.   I think at last count there were 406 of these runs taking place every Saturday at 9.00 a.m. at different locations throughout the UK.  Parkrun organise free, weekly, 5km timed runs. They are open to everyone, free, and are safe and easy to take part in.  The initiative first started about 10 years ago, with just one run, now it has expanded and new runs start up all the time.  It has become something of a tradition that every community-run celebrates their ‘birthday’ on the anniversary of the date on which they were first established.  It is a good excuse for an annual prize-giving, conversation and lots of cake!  This particular party was at a parkrun that is reasonably local to me, although not my ‘home’ parkrun, I made a special trip to their event to join in their celebrations.\n\nThe ‘party’ was held at a place called Graves Park in Sheffield.  It is a lovely public open space, which also has a small animal park, so part of the 5km run takes you past an eclectic mix of animals including highland cows; alpaca; donkeys; pigs and a couple of curious goats.  Everyone assembled in time for the usual Saturday at 9.00 a.m. starts to take part in the run, but because it was the Graves parkrun’s fourth birthday everything was a bit different from normal...\n\nSo in terms of what people did at the party?  Well, we all ran 5 km for a start.  That’s not what usually happens at a birthday party, but it is what always happens at a parkrun.  In other ways though, the event was a bit more unexpected.  The main change was that the course was run in reverse.  This was quite comical, as it is confusing running in the ‘wrong’ direction, and meant some of the steep uphill climbs on the usual route were replaces with death-defying downhill scrambles!  It’s a bit like trying to cross your arms the wrong way round, you’d think it would be easy or at least ‘no different’ from how you usually do it - until you actually try.  Go on, have a go, you’ll soon see what I mean!  The next difference was that lots of us were in fancy dress!  I’ll wear fancy dress at any excuse.  I have a child’s toy wrap-around pony costume.  It looks great, like I’m riding a miniature pony, but is in fact incredibly light and easy to run in.  Other people wore onesies (all in one jumpsuit made to look like animals).  A few men wore drag (dressed in women’s clothes) some more imaginative runners came dressed up as Roman soldiers (complete with helmets and large circular shields) or various cloaked superheroes (Batman and Robin and Wonder Woman just for starters).  It was great fun, we must have been quite a sight, some 250 runners or so storming round in ridiculous outfits.  At the end of the run, lots of people had brought sweets or cake with them to share as part of the birthday celebrations.  We all adjourned to a convenient café within the park for a good-humoured prize giving.  Lots of awards were handed out, not just for running fast but for humorous things too.  Champion volunteer; fastest canine (there is a whippet that regularly takes park, and sometimes its owner’s even auctions the opportunity to run with the dog as it will drag the runners round and give them a chance of getting a really fast time!)  I clapped in recognition as the prizes were awarded, but, most exciting of all, there was one extra prize.  For ‘Best Fancy Dress Costume', I won!  My pony is called Roger, and we collected our prize of a big box of sweets together.  I am not very athletic, so I’d never win any sports prize for actually running, but I was so delighted to win a prize within the parkrun community I thought I’d burst!  After the prizes had been given out, we all stayed in the café, chatting, admiring each other’s costumes and most importantly of all drinking tea and eating cake.  Someone had even made a special parkrun cake with the parkrun logo on it.  It was a great party indeed!\n\nWhy did I particularly enjoy it?  Well, I think it must be obvious surely.  I got to spend my Saturday morning doing my favourite thing, which is taking part in parkrun, with a fantastic group of people, followed by tea and cake. What’s more, I got an excuse to wear a party dress, have a good old giggle with friends AND I won a prize. What’s not to like.  Parkrun is great and parkrun event birthday parties?  Well, they are better still!"

    "Answer": "Luckily I was invited to a private DJ party last month arranged by one of my college friends. This was a different kind of experience for me. I will describe the event for this cue card topic as it was a great party.\n\nThe party was organised marking the birthday of Samantha, my bestie in college. We are at the undergraduate level at the American College of Greece. We both share everything between us which has created a strong bond between us, and accordingly, she invited me to this private party. I was amazed at the party arrangement. It began in the evening with light snacks and soft drinks, and then the show started. We took our supper during the DJ show and returned home safe and sound once the event ended. The show was extremely exciting and the invited guests were enjoying the music. I also danced on the rhythm and enjoyed the moments perfectly.\n\nThe party was held in the garden of Samantha’s house. In fact, she lives in a large villa with her family. Though it was difficult for her to arrange the show in the garden, she managed the permission from her dad after a lot of struggle. Some of her cousins helped to decorate the entire garden which finally looked like a football ground with a round boundary. So, it was really difficult for them to decorate the entire venue. The stage for the DJs was built with the help of outside professionals. The lighting system was unique. The food corner was set in a corner containing different delicious food items and beverages. I liked the arrangement most among the other features of the party because it was the first of its kind for me.\n\nA limited number of guests were invited to the party. Before the DJ show begins, Samantha had cut the birthday cake. She stepped 18. The guests present there, including me, sang the traditional birthday song and wished for her very successful in the coming days. Then she distributed the pieces from her birthday cake. Really I have never had such a juicy and delicious birthday cake before. The DJs were not on time. So, the show was late. The people passed their time by gossiping with each other and taking photographs. I think the number of selfies was more than any other thing on that day. However, the DJ show began at around 7.00 pm. Then the people moved to take seats near the stage. But the majority of them stood before the platform to dance with the music. I went there as I could not manage a seat to sit. \n\nI enjoyed everything at the party until the last moment. It was exciting for me. In fact, this was the first experience for me to participate in a DJ party and listen to live music. All of the people invited there were amazing and helped me to dance by showing some steps and moves. I loved the food and drinks. Some of the traditional foods of Greece were ordered (as her mother was unable to cook for this crowd) and we enjoyed them profoundly. The lighting of the venue was breathtaking. Some hidden lights were set that illuminated the entire ground from different parts. Overall, it was the very best experience of a party in my entire life."

    "Answer": "Sometimes, I think that if this particular electronic equipment were invented during the middle ages or little later, it surely would have been considered as one of the 7th wonders of the old world by replacing one of the existing ones. Today, I would like to talk about a piece of wonderful electronic equipment which I think deserves a lot more credit than we are ready to give.\n\nThis electronic equipment is called the mighty “vacuum cleaner”. Of course, we might not just call it “mighty” because we are probably too much used to working with it, but if we can just manage our world for a week without a vacuum cleaner, I am sure that we would gladly change your mind about putting the word “mighty” before a vacuum cleaner.\n\nAnyway, so what is exactly so special about a vacuum cleaner? Well, we can answer this question by simply saying that this incredible equipment helps me clean my home and office, and all other places between them, and put them in order through the mechanism of an air pump and a suction device inside it. Now, even though, we have this equipment at our home since the time I can remember about things, but I didn’t really learn to use it until after I had started high school. Of course, for that, I will have to thank my elder sister since it was her who taught me how to switch it on and manoeuvre it on the floor and carpet to suck the dirt off them. By the way, unlike other vacuum cleaners, the one we have at home is lightweight and rather easy to operate on all kinds of surfaces.\n\nAnyway, I find this electronic equipment really useful, mainly because it helps me and my family keep our home dirt-free and clean without using too much of our efforts and time. The equipment is useful also because it helps us save a significant amount of money since we don’t have to hire any cleaning person to clean our home."

    "Answer": "This is an interesting topic. My immediate thought is that I don’t use all that much electronic equipment – I don’t even have a smartphone. I do use a lot of a rather commonplace technology; phone; laptop; ‘white goods’ like refrigerators and washing machines, but I think they’d be quite boring to talk about. I mean, there isn’t much I could say about learning how to use a fridge is there? Not to worry, I can think of something I find really useful and only acquired very recently. It has been a learning curve, but it is so worth it. I’ll tell you what it is, how I’ve learned to use it, how long I’ve had it and how come I find it so useful.  \n\nThe piece of equipment is a GPS (global positioning satellite) watch. It’s called a tomtom runner, and basically, if I wear it whilst out running it tracks various bits of information. It will tell me how long I’ve run for, what pace, what distance, the elevation and other useful things. It can buzz on my wrist after every mile for example which is either motivating or dispiriting depending on how well my run is going! When I get back home after my run, I simply connect the watch to my laptop, and through some magic of technology, it uploads my run onto a software programme called Strava. This means I can see a map of where I’ve run, compare that day’s run with previous attempts at that route, and even see who else has done the same run if they use Strava too. It even tells me how many calories I’ve burned doing that run – never as many as I’d like if I’m honest!\n\nHow did I learn to use it? Hmm, shall I be honest... I cheated a bit. I’m something of a late adopter of technology, I find it frustrating learning to use new equipment, and given that I’d been managing perfectly well without a fancy GPS running watch ever since I’d started running a couple of years ago I couldn’t see the benefits of putting myself through all that angst or working out how to use it properly. However, all of that changed in January this year. My running club had organised a three-month winter challenge, we were put in teams and had to commit to doing so many runs each week of a certain distance. To take part, I’d need a GPS watch. Points were given for distance, elevation and number of runs, with bonus points for running in sub-zero conditions or very early in the morning. The idea was to encourage us all to keep on running through the dark and dismal British winter. Rather reluctantly, I went to my local running shop. They were BRILLIANT. They recommended a ‘cheap and cheerful’ starter watch, and set it all up for me. They charged it, connected it up to my laptop (which I took in with me); downloaded all the software. All I had to do at first was push a button to start the watch when I set out, and push the same button again to stop! After my run, I just connected it to my laptop and as if by magic everything updated. To begin with, this was enough, but after a few weeks, I started to play around with other buttons on the watch and discovered it can do more fancy things! I am still learning how to use it properly, and it is rather trial and error, but now I can see the benefits of this nifty bit of kit I’m much more motivated to invest time in working out its finer features! I’ve now had the watch for just about 6 months.\n\nWhy do I find this GPS watch useful? Well, it’s been really unexpected, but I love that I now have a record of all my runs. Even if I feel I’ve had a bad day running, being able to see the overall distance I’ve covered, or the elevation builds my confidence. I was surprised at how many miles I actually cover each week. True, they are slow miles, but they add up all the same. It also has made running much more fun. I can see if friends have done the same run like me, and there is even a feature on Strava that allows me to identify other runners I pass en route, so you can see how your runs compare with theirs. There are some fun things too. There is a trend towards something called Strava Art. Basically, that means you deliberately try and run to create the outline of a picture with your route. During our winter challenge, we had to try and ‘draw’ a rabbit, with our run route (for Easter) and a heart shape (for Valentine’s Day). It was had planning it out, and plodding round the paths I was really unsure if it would actually work. Would the satellite pick me up? Would the route really turn out as expected once it was uploaded? It was incredibly rewarding when they did, but even when they didn’t that was really entertaining. Because everyone in the running club was doing the same challenge I really forward to seeing their shapes too.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say, is that this unexpected bit of technology has really revolutionised my running. It enables me to track progress, it tells you if you’ve achieved a ‘Personal Best’ time on a particular segment, and it makes running much more social. It has also made me a bit more accountable to others. I can see what my friends are doing – but they can see what I’m up to as well. It makes me want to try harder so I’m not caught out slacking. Seven months ago, before I got my GPS watch I really didn’t understand why anyone would want one. Now, I feel bereft if I run without it. It feels like ‘if I can’t upload it on Strava afterwards, my run didn’t really happen!’ I know rationally, that is a stupid attitude, but honestly, it’s true. I think if you asked most runners, or cyclists who use this bit of electronic equipment they would sheepishly admit to the same thing. It seems it is quite true, you can’t miss what you never had. I never gave a moment’s thought to how useful a GPS watch might be until I was nudged into it by my running club, but now I find it hard to imagine how any runner could function without one! What a difference a few months makes eh?"

    "Answer": "Presently, it is almost impossible to do without a laptop for an undergraduate student like me. So, recently I have bought a Dell Inspiron 17 7000 Series Laptop for my ordinary use of the money my dad gave am and the savings from my part-time job at a bar.  \n\nThis a highly useful electronic device for me. It helps me in great ways. The outlook and design of the laptop are extremely beautiful and the operating system has been improved. This is a great piece for gaming as well. The design of this laptop comes with forged aluminium. Moreover, the laptop screen does not irritate eyes and the backlit keyboard helps to work in lower lighting condition. The touch display is made with Corning Gorilla Glass and it has made it stronger than the other brands with a smooth touchscreen. The excellent sound quality truly impresses me when I listen to music on this machine.  \n\nI was in trouble while using the laptop in the primary stage due to my ignorance on how to use a touchscreen. But gradually I developed skills and find it interesting to work by touching the screen. Besides, I was not familiar with the backlit keyboard and now it seems interesting. I can work even in dark. No chances for frequent mistakes while working in a darker room. The large display is another blessing for me. Earlier, I used a desktop which had a 14-inch CRT monitor. So, everything appeared smaller in size and shape. But the experience has changed completely with the 17-inch display. Though I was unable to smoothly operate the laptop for the first two or three days, I have learnt everything within a very short time.  \n\nI have been using the laptop for around one and a half months. By this time, I have been habituated to use it randomly. Even I am taking the laptop at my classes for presentations. A few months ago I asked my dad to buy me a desktop computer because my existing computer could not provide me with the required level of performances. It was too slow to run and even took an unusually long time to open the word processor. If I got connected to the internet, the situations turned worst. The machine turned non-responsive. Considering all the issues, I decided to buy a new computer for me. Surprisingly, I found that the price of the Dell laptop I just bought was within my budget and thus I bought this laptop from Dell and it was the latest model. Though it comes with a warranty for three years, I am careful in its use.\n\nThis laptop I recently bought is highly useful for me. Most of the times, I watch movies on it. The screen resolution is the top standard and comes with perfect sound quality. Moreover, I no longer have to worry about the backup time as it has a good charging backup (up to around 7 hours). So, the tensions to save the documents frequently are gone. The lightweight of this piece is also helpful for me. I can carry it easily on my shoulder if I have any presentations in the class. Considering all such aspects, this is a very helpful electronic equipment for me."

    "Answer": "Last year, I took a trip to one of the most beautiful places, with the most beautiful tea gardens in it, of my country. It was supposed to be a fun and exciting trip, as my tour guide had told me, but instead, it actually became a boring affair in the end.\n\nAnyway, I had planned for this trip well in advance since I don’t really get much vacation time from my job. To make the trip really smooth and fun, I even contacted a famous tour organizing agency of my country who was supposed to manage everything, from booking the hotel to deciding the food menu, on my behalf. For all these arrangements, of course, I had to pay some good amount of money to the touring agency, but I didn’t really mind it much since they assured me of a fun and exciting trip.\n\nNow, everything was alright with my trip up and until reaching our destination. After all, the bus, which took us to the destination, was nice and comfortable, but things started to become a bit messy and unpleasant as soon as I arrived at my hotel. In fact, the hotel, chosen for our stay, was spreading foul smell. To make things a bit more complicated for me, the hotel manager told me that I would need to share my room with another guest (a person who was touring with me also to visit the tea gardens), apparently because the hotel didn’t have enough rooms for all the guests. However, the worst part of the tour was that my visiting period to the tea garden was cut short due to the forecast of some bad weather.\n\nThe trip indeed wasn’t up to my expectation since the touring company didn’t collect enough necessary information from its partners (i.e. hotel) to ensure an enjoyable experience for its customers. Besides, the touring agency didn’t have any contingency planning either to deal with bad weather. All in all, this was not what I was expecting from my trip after spending so much money."

    "Answer": "Right, I’m racking my brain to think of a good example for this one. Often when I set out on a trip or mini-adventure, I try to keep an open mind, to be flexible and make the most of whatever experience presents itself. I think if you embark on things with very fixed expectations that can end in disappointment. Then again, sometimes it’s pretty clear that you have a reasonable expectation that, for example, a bus will take you from one place to a particular end destination, or your outing to collect a purchase from a certain shop will pass largely unremarkably. So a trip doesn’t have to be anything especially adventurous, just in this instance something which didn’t pass in the way I’d expected it to… Hmm, hang on, I’ve got one, I think it’s a good example, perhaps even a comical one too – I wonder what you will make of it. I’ll tell you where I went, what I did, what happened, and why the trip was not AT ALL what was expected…\n\nSome years ago I celebrated my fortieth birthday by booking an exotic holiday. I saved up for a very long time so that I could afford to go, and it was certainly special. I was to spend some time in Tanzania on safari and then immediately afterwards travel on to the Island of Zanzibar for a two days extension on the beaches there. The holiday itself was absolutely amazing, and when I got to Zanzibar I couldn’t believe how lovely it was. Beautiful beaches, friendly and welcoming people, and extraordinary architecture. The city seemed to me to be out of a fairy tale. A labyrinth of passageways with tall ancient walls and enormous Morocco style solid wooden doors towering over the narrow streets, which were heaving with local people going about their daily business. Now, the first thing that happened in Zanzibar, was that I heard from my travel agent, that there was a problem with my return flight back to the UK. They were very sorry, but I’d have to stay on for three extra days – at their expense of course – in a luxury hotel! I couldn’t believe it! This wasn’t a hardship at all, I felt as if I was in paradise, and the hotel suite I was staying in was bigger than my own flat at home, this was really no inconvenience at all, I felt as if I’d won the lottery! However, this is not the unexpected trip I want to tell you about, although it \"I\", the cause of my embarking on it. Finding myself with some extra days to fill in an unknown location, I met up with some other travellers in the same situation and we planned what we could do together. One of them had read about a really amazing restaurant in the city and suggested we all go there together. The problem was that gorgeous as Zanzibar undoubtedly was, its main centre really isn’t a city to explore at night. The winding maze of lanes with its mix of Swahili and Islamic influences were beautiful certainly, but also nigh on impossible to navigate. The streets were unlit, and although most people were law-abiding as naïve comparatively wealthy tourists we were warned we would be at risk of the pickpocket or worse if we ventured out unaccompanied. However, there was an easy solution. The hotel said that if we just stepped outside, there would always be some enterprising local person who for a dollar between us, would take us safely to wherever we wanted to go. By employing them, we would be safe from other touts or pickpockets, and could easily walk to where we wanted to go, plus contribute a bit of money to the local community. This sounded like a good plan and we all agreed on this trip to the favoured restaurant.\n\nFrom memory, I think there were about half a dozen of us. We stepped outside our hotel, and just as we had been advised a potential guide approached us and agreed to take us where we wanted to go for just a dollar. We handed over our fee, and he set off – at quite a pace. We jogged behind him through the dark maze of narrow lanes. It was exciting being out at night, the main town – called Stone Town with good reason – was even more spectacular and spooky at night. We marvelled at how our guide was able to take us down hidden rat-runs on seemingly un-navigable shortcuts. At one point one of our members lost his nerve. He became convinced that this man was trying to lure us to a secret location where we would all be mugged and robbed away from spying eyes, but the rest of us laughed at his ridiculous caution! After some half an hour or so, our guide announced we were at the restaurant because we had already paid him, he then vanished into the dark. After a few seconds, we realised it wasn’t where we had wanted to go at all! It was a completely different restaurant, perhaps one where he got a commission for bringing tourists. Nevertheless, it looked very good, and laughingly we decided to eat there anyway. The food was absolutely excellent, and with the exception of our more cautious fellow traveller who feared treachery at every turn and was indignant that we’d been tricked in this way, the rest of us found it hilarious. After all, we’d enjoyed our night tour of the streets of Zanzibar, and there was no way on earth we’d have had the courage to do that on our own. In any case, we had a delicious meal so where was the harm.\n\nAfter our meal, it slowly dawned on us that we now had to find our way back to the hotel, and we had absolutely no idea where we were. This wasn’t looking so good. We paid our bill, and managed to ask at the restaurant for directions ‘home’. We showed him the card with our hotel’s details on it. The restauranteur looked really confused. At first, we thought he just didn’t understand what we were asking, but eventually, he took us to the door, pointed down the road, and there was our hotel. It was within sight, we were perhaps 300 metres away from where we started off. Our guide it seemed had taken us round in a big circle, ending up almost back where we started!\n\nSo to summarise, the trip was a guided excursion to a restaurant, so that is where we went. What did I do? Employ a guide to take me and some others to a recommended eating place. What happened? Well, we had a magical mystery tour that ended up somewhere else entirely. The trip didn’t meet my expectations because strictly speaking, we didn’t end up where we were supposed to, not even close! However, it honestly didn’t matter. I really enjoyed my tour through the pitch-black maze of streets in Zanzibar, I still had a delicious meal with new friends, and for just a dollar that adventure was worth every penny! All’s well that ends well after all, and it was a great mini-adventure.\n\nIt just shows that things might not always work out quite as planned or as expected, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that things end in disaster. Far from it, I think I get more pleasure from this traveller’s tale than I would if everything had gone exactly as expected from the outset!"

    "Answer": "Travelling is my hobby and from my travelling experience, I have gained both pleasant and disappointing experiences. Luckily my delightful experience outweighs my unpleasant experience. Today I will share one unsatisfying experience of mine that was in Acapulco, Mexico, in the last year. \n\nBeing influenced by the scenic beauty, by one of my college mates, of the beach in the city, Acapulco, I commenced the trip. I fact, Acapulco is a beach resort in Mexico. But the city is filled with high-rise buildings than scenic beauties. Now the town got a shape of the resorts and attracts tourists around the world but earlier it was primarily used as a seaport and a colony of Spain. The naming of the town has a history and the city also achieved fame for its enriched nightlife. Diving under the sea is one of the most attractive activities here in line with other leisure activities.   \n\nI went there as a tourist with the intention to enjoy the natural views and get engaged in the leisure activities available there. So, I did a lot of things there but had some unwanted experiences (will talk about that soon). Among the activities I performed there, the notables were – taking a sunbath, diving on the sea, having the fresh seafood, wandered through the beach and more others. I liked the sunrise and sunset scenes more than the other things. The seafood was delicious indeed. Besides, I went to visit the other tourist spots in the city and came to know about the past history of the city and how the population here survived. \n\nEverything went well but some of the experiences were not up to the mark. Despite being the oldest beach resort in Mexico, there are lots of chances for improvements in every sector of the city. In a majority of the visiting spots, the services are unsatisfactory. The entire city has been divided into two parts – the north end and the south end. Discriminatory treatments are a common issue there. If you are rich, you would get a royal reception. On the other sides, if you are an ordinary tourist like me, you are to get disappointed. The services will be minimal though you are to pay higher than the ordinary expenses. \n\nI am dissatisfied with the journey. My flight got delayed for eight hours. It could not land at the Acapulco International Airport at the scheduled time. It was also difficult to manage a taxi. I booked a single room in a hotel (not naming that) but once I reached there, they said to me that the hotel was full of guests. So, I picked another one after spending a couple of hours on the Acapulco streets. But the accommodation system was not high standard and they charged me more than usual. The restaurant was unable to meet my requirements for cleanliness and thus I took my meals out of the hotel, as long as I stayed there. Moreover, I expected to enjoy a great vacation here, but the surrounding environment forced me to leave the place on the third day of the visit. So, the trip could not fill my expectations."

    "Answer": "There are so many tools and technologies around us today, which we can use in our mobile phones, in order to make our life a bit easier and to have more fun.  Today, I would like to talk about one such tool, or an “App” rather, which I have recently added in my smartphone.\n\nThe name of this “app” is called “Goggle Fit”. Now, before I tell you what Google Fit exactly is, and what it does, I would like to provide some general information on why we usually use an “App” on our mobile.\n\nWell, an “app” (short for “application”) is a computer programme or software application which is specifically designed to run on a mobile phone or device in order to accomplish a specific task.\n\nGoogle fit is just like one such “application” except, of course, it is used to keep us healthy and fit in a rather systematic and yet convenient manner. Anyway, made by Google Inc., in collaboration with the world health organization, this fitness application is rather easy to use. All one needs to do is to open the application and “add” workout type (like running or biking) and track the workout in order to get the related data and stats about your workout activities, like how long you have spent in doing the activity, or how many calories you have burnt. This app can even give us stats on how many steps we have taken and what distance we have run in order to keep our fitness activities on track. However, this particular application works best when general data, like a person’s height and weight, is also entered into this rather useful mobile app.\n\nIn conclusion, I would also like to add that this application is important to me, mainly because it allows me to understand what kinds of activities are working best for my health without any help from a health expert.  Another benefit of using this app is that it is rather simple to use, and it allows me to adjust my health metrics in real-time."

    "Answer": "I own a Sony smartphone and it is powered by the Android mobile operating system. One of the applications I frequently use on my phone is Gmail. This is an email application that allows any Gmail user to send or receive emails. This application enables me to check my emails or send an email whenever I need to. Gmail is a free email service provider which is owned by the tech giant Google\nInc.\n\nBoth my personal and work email accounts are in Gmail and I have to check for new emails several times and day. I often send emails to my colleagues, friends and family members using this application. The application is quite easy to use and offers an intuitive interface. To use it, I just have to tap on the app icon and the main interface appears. The home screen shows the Inbox, Compose Email, Search and Menu options. The menu brings several other options including the categorised email viewing option along with the 'Label' feature. I can use the 'Label' and 'Tag' features to manage categories of my emails. The emails I sent are saved in the 'Sent' folder and deleting an email takes just a tap of a finger. The 'Settings' and 'Help' options are present at the bottom of the menu. The 'Search' feature helps me find any email quite easily. Furthermore, whenever, I need to open a document,  I can either save it to the local memory or directly open it using Google docs and this is quite convenient for me.\n\nThe Gmail mobile application is one of the most downloaded and widely used applications that has more than 1 billion users. Gmail used to offer more than 1 GB storage a few years back and these days Google accounts holders have access to a shared pool of storage i.e. every account holder of Google gets 15 GB of free space, which is shared across his Gmail, Google Drive, and Google+ Photos. It also offers 25 MB attachment option in a single email. I often need to send large files, especially to my colleagues and I find Gmail application a lifesaver for me! This application that I use for accessing my email has an advanced spam filtering feature which keeps my 'Inbox' clean and keeps away the spammers.\n\nI have tried a few other email service providers and their emails access applications before I finally switched to Gmail. In terms of features, storage, accessibility, performance, security, Gmail application is second to none. I have been using this application for more than 6 years and it hardly crashes or cause any problem.\n\nSince email has become one of the primary modes of communications and we cannot do without it in modern days. we need to use a handy email application so that we can check or send emails anytime, even when we are on the streets. The Gmail application perfectly match the requirements and expectations I have for such an application. Finally, I would like to say that this is the most important mobile application to me."

    "Answer": "Recently I have bought an iPhone 7 mobile phone and I am very glad of its features and performance. I installed the Viber application and this is a very useful application for me. Now I will describe the features of this particular application, how I use it and why this is a handy mobile application for me. \n\nIn fact, Viber is a kind of platform that is able to transmit messages instantly to another end where the similar app is being used. Besides, the app is able to transmit images, audios or even videos as well. So, globally a wide range of people use this app for instant messaging. As a direct result, it has become a popular communication app for smartphone users. The platform has been developed by Viber Media, an Israel-based company. Now the app is available for several mobile operating systems like iOS for Apple, Android, BlackBerry OS, Windows Phone and others. The number of registered users is on increase for this app. \n\nUsing Viber is very easy and efficient. There are no complexities of the installation process. At first, the smartphone users are to download the app on their device from their respective app sources like iTunes App Store or Google Play store. Then they are to install the app on the device and set it up. During the installation process, they are to allow the app to use some of the features of the phone like access to the phonebook or photos etc. Besides, the app may ask for the permission on some other specific issues based on your device features. Once the installation is done, one can start using the app. But without an active internet connection, the app will not work. The users would not be able to send or receive any messages or notifications. So, an active internet connection is required to use Viber.   \n\nI am glad about this app. It has helped me greatly to cut my phone call costs. In fact, communication through the app is for free. Only some megabytes are used to send or receive the messages. So, I do not need to pay any extra charge for making a call on Viber. Besides, it is easier to send images using this app. Using the smartphone, any Viber user can send images from the device’s image library. The app comes with another special feature using which I can create a group with the other users and may have chats with them where I can share my latest images. The use of emoticons is also another feature that is benefiting me to express my feelings.  \n\nIn this age of globalisation, using the internet-based apps to communicate is the best way, in my opinion, and experience. As a student, often I need to share my notes with my buddies and it helps me in sharing the notes and lessons in image formats. Besides, the cost is quite low. Additionally, I am able to share my other important events using the images and emoticons. But such facilities are still unavailable with the ordinary telecommunication system. Though they are present in some mobile platforms, they are available on a limited scale which cannot express the entire emotional state. Besides, Viber has a number of functionalities and the users can also buy credits to make voice calls. The user interface is attractive and allows me to have my image with my contact details. I prefer this application for all the advantages it offers."

    "Answer": "I remember my little 5 years old cousin who just loved to play cricket. Not to mention, of course, I also loved to play cricket. So, when he insisted one day, almost about 14 years ago from now that I would need to make him a special cricket bat, I just couldn’t say “no” to him.\n\nSo, why he needed me to make a very special bat for him? Well, apparently because he wanted to beat everybody who was playing with him and against him except, of course, I was probably the worst “craftsman” under the sun. But, I still took the challenge upon me because I needed to prove to my cousin that I was indeed the best cousin in this world.\n\nSo, anyway, now coming to the real challenge of making the perfect cricket bat for my little cousin. For that, of course, I had to find a fine piece of flat wood, a small table saw, sandpaper and a rubber strip. To make the cricket bat, I first cut the wood with the table saw, followed by a wood plane work, in the shape of a cricket bat with a width about 3 inches, the thickness of about half inch and a length of about 2 feet (please understand that it is a mini bat for a little kid that I was making). Then I made the whole piece of bat shiny and smooth by pressing sand over it. Finally, I glued the rubber strip over the handle of the bat to make it look like a real cricket bat before formally handing it over to my little cousin. Thankfully, the little guy liked my handy work!\n\nI felt really happy and glad that I didn’t disappoint my little cousin after making that cricket bat for him. Besides, I also felt little proud of my work because I never really did anything like that with my own hands before. All in all, it was a fun thing to do while learning something new."

    "Answer": "Kite flying is a popular activity in China and I have made different types of kites on various occasions all by myself. For this cue card topic, I would love to talk about a dragon kite that I made when I was around 16 years old.  \n\nQingming Festival, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, is a traditional and widely celebrated festival in China and it usually falls in April. During this festival, many people, especially children and young play around with a variety of kites. On such an occasion I made a kite which was more than 4 feet in length and looked like a red dragon. This sort of kite is usually called \"dragon kite\" and it is quite tough to make and fly. When a traditional kite might take an hour to be made, a dragon kite sometimes takes more than a week, depending on the size and shape of it.\n\nIt took me more than 4 days to complete this kite and I required to purchase some special papers, colour, plastic, glue, ribbon, and sticks to make this kite. First I had to use the sticks of different sizes to build the main shape of the kite. The sticks were linked to each other very strongly and I used glue, sticks and plastic to make the final shape of the kite. Then I  checked whether the structure was strong enough to fly or not. After that,  I wrapped the frame with colourful papers and plastics to give it a beautiful shape. I was quite happy to see the final outcome and was convinced that it would fly without any obstacle. The wings of the dragon were more than 1 feet each and I had to be very careful while making it. Any wrong shape of the wing would actually ruin the whole project. I had to make it strong while keeping it light. That was a tough challenge but luckily I was quite successful in making the final kite.  \n\nWhen I made the kite and finally flew it in the sky, it was a great experience for me. I was relieved that it was flying and looked good. People were looking at that large size dragon kite and some of them appreciated it. It was embracing the white cloud in the sky and went higher than most other kites. It was moving as if a great dragon was acting as a guardian of the sky and protecting the people below it. I was quite excited when it finally declared its prominence in the sky."

    "Answer": "Oh my goodness! This topic is tough for me. I’m not really a ‘handcraft’ sort of person. I am very bad at creative things, I really admire it when I see what other people can do – somehow taking some old newspapers and a bucket of glue and creating some extraordinary work of art out of papier mâché, but that isn’t really me, unfortunately. If I tried the same it would end up with spilt glue and newspaper print smeared everywhere and a gooey heap of soggy paper trailing all around the room! However, when I was very little we used to sometimes do crafts at school, and occasionally I’d see a children’s TV programme which would include ideas of things that were easy to make with discarded household items. I can think of an example of this, and that’s what I’m going to talk about today. I’ll tell you what it was (though that might be harder than you think), how I made it, what I did with it, and what I felt about it too.\n \nWell, as to the ‘what it was’. I suppose I can only say it was a ‘useful box for putting things in’, (which is a quote from Winnie the Pooh in case you were wondering). Not that useful probably, because it was very small. It will make more sense when I explain how I made it.\n \nSo, what you needed was an old matchbox. Nowadays, matchboxes tend to be made of cardboard, but when I was very little they were actually made of very finely cut wood sometimes. I have no idea how that worked, but they were. All I did, was take an old matchbox once the matches had all been used. Then I got hold of some very special sellotape. It was gold, I really don’t know where it came from because it would be unusual even now. However, I had it, and some silver tape too. I very carefully wound the gold and silver tape around the outside of the matchbox until it was completely covered up. If you look at the box now you can see it’s a bit wonky, so it must have been hard to do with my little podgy fingers as a toddler. I then found a button from somewhere and stuck it in the middle of the top of the box. Job done! A little box for secret treasure. So what did I do with it? Well, the purpose of this creative outburst was to make a gift for my Dad. I’m not sure if I did this for fathers’ day, or whether I made it for a birthday present, but it was very definitely made with my dad in mind. So what I did with it, was wrap it up carefully for him to open at breakfast on the morning of his special day.\n \nHonestly, I don’t remember now how I felt about making it myself, but I’m guessing I would have been very proud, because I was at an age when I’d have been too little to have any money of my own, and it took quite a bit of initiative to come up with this gift idea and follow it through (though I have a suspicion my mum might have helped a bit with glueing on the button!). However, last year my Dad died, and over the subsequent months, I’ve been sorting through some of his things quite gradually. In a side drawer of his desk, I came across this little box which he had carefully kept for nearly 50 years. It had been put into service for storing potentially useful paper clips, and was very suitable for such a job. It was really strange seeing it again. On the one hand, it was long forgotten, until that moment I had no idea he still had it, let alone for current use. On the other hand, as soon as I saw it I recognised it instantly. It was quite poignant, but also a good memory. I had done this spontaneous thing for him, and although essentially it was just an old matchbox wrapped up in sellotape which had now largely lost its stickiness and was peeling away that didn’t matter. It wasn’t the quality of my handcraft that was important, it was the love and determination that had gone into making it.  \n\nSo it seems, even though my attempt at handcraft wouldn’t win any prizes in a competition, I hope this little story goes to show that really and truly, it is often the case that it really is ‘the thought that counts’! How do I feel about making it myself? Well, really happy, it was such a personal exchange, and I was happy that my Dad must have really appreciated it to have kept it for all those years."

    "Answer": "Until recently, the city, in which I currently live, didn’t really have that many serious problems, probably because the city had enough resources at its disposal to deal with any kind of problems. But, something happened in the last few years, and suddenly we can see that our city is facing a lot of problems, and today, I would like to talk about one of them here.\n\nThe problem, I would like to discuss here, is our city’s overall healthcare problem which was never an issue for us even before 5 years. But, over the last 5 years, things have deteriorated to such a point that the common people of our city can’t really trust our hospital authority anymore with their health.\n\nAnd the reason, for which, they can’t trust the healthcare providers of our city anymore is that the patients have to wait at least 30 minutes in a big queue just to get a simple thing, like checking the blood group of a person, tested. Besides, we can also see a number of patients lying or sleeping on the floors of our hospitals and clinic, apparently because they just don’t have enough beds for poor patients.\n\nAnyway, people and the city authority are mainly blaming a huge influx of population from the urban areas into our city, in addition to other reasons, like the lack of budgets and enough skilled health workers. But, whatever is causing this problem, the truth is it is a serious matter - matter of life and death - and something needs to be done immediately in order to take care of it.\n\nI believe, in order to solve this problem, first, we need to make sure that people in the urban areas have better income opportunities in their own areas so that they don’t have to move into the city. Besides, healthcare budgets should also be proportionately increased in order to take care of the more healthcare needs, like paying for building new healthcare facilities and employing more healthcare professionals."

    "Answer": "I live in (… say the name of your city...) and this city has a very large population. With the increasing population, unplanned urbanisation, rapid industrialisation and lack of proper steps from the authority have led to many different problems here and traffic congestion, in my opinion, is the worst of all.  \n\nTraffic jam in large cities is a common problem; however, this in our city is far worse. It is a common scenario in our city that cars are stuck on roads and passengers and drivers have to wait for an unusually long time before they can move forward. Sometimes cars and buses remain unmoved for more than an hour and people get very depressed and annoyed due to this. The long lines of cars and buses and their movement at a snail's pace have become a very annoying yet common scenario in this city. The rush hours are even more devastating and bad traffic kills a considerable amount of time each day. The business owners, office goers, students and their parents and people from all walks of life suffer seriously due to this uncontrollable traffic jam. Everyone seems devastated and vexed about it, authorities know that as well, and yet, no proper step has been taken to solve this heinous problem.\n\nThere are many reasons behind this problem and an increasing number of cars and vehicles, in my opinion, is the main reason. The number of cars is increasing more rapidly than the construction of new roads and roads are becoming more congested. Second, the lack of proper traffic control system and scarcity of traffic police could be another reason for that. Moreover, the public transportations are not as reliable and updated as they should have been and due to that people are mostly relying on private cars in my city. Violation of traffic rules is another main reason for this unbearable traffic jam.\n\nSome effective measures must be taken in order to address this serious problem. Since this is already a grave issue, steps should be taken before it gets worse. First, government and road authority should invest more money in building new roads and for the repairing and maintaining of old ones, particularly in areas where a traffic jam is more severe. On the other hand, public transportations should be improved so that people use them more frequently. Restriction on private car ownership in our city is also required for the control of increasing traffic jam. At the same time, it is essential that stricter traffic rules be issues and violation of traffic regulation should be severely punished in order to reduce the traffic jam."

    "Answer": "Oh no! I love the city I live in – Sheffield in the UK! It feels wrong to talk about its problems when there is so much about the city that I’d like to celebrate and share with you instead. However, if you really insist, I can think of a problem in my city that certainly leaves me breathless with frustration more often than I like to admit. I’ll try to explain what it is, how serious it is, and the causes of the problem.\n \nSo, don’t laugh, but the problem with my city of Sheffield is the hills! Before I moved to Sheffield a few years ago now, I didn’t really know anything about the city. Since I’ve come here I absolutely love it. The city is quite compact, known as ‘greenest city in Europe’ because of a large number of outdoor green spaces within the city boundaries, and is next to one of the UK’s National Parks, The Peak District. I suppose the clue is in the name, ‘the peaks’. Sheffield is said to be built on seven hills – like Rome apparently, though I’ve never been there so I don’t know how the two cities compare. I do know, that when I first moved to Sheffield I could not believe how steep, how long and how many hills there are! I am not talking about gentle undulations, I am talking about proper steep hills, where you have to wear walking shoes, dig deep, head down and haul yourself up to the hills. I thought I was reasonably fit, but soon discovered I was a ‘soft southerner’ (that’s a sort of affectionate derogatory phrase some people who live in the colder, hillier north use to describe their compatriots who live nearer to London in the south of the United Kingdom). I really puffed my way up those hills, and would have to stop now and again to recover my breath, whereas my friends who were born and bred in Sheffield had no problem in storming up gradients that I thought impossibly steep.\n \nHow serious is the problem? Well, it depends! It is genuinely a problem if you are, say, elderly or disabled, it is physically challenging to get around. In winter, when there are snow and ice often roads become completely impassable, buses are cancelled and those that are able to walk to work have to do so – sometimes clinging to sidewalls and lampposts along their route to avoid sliding downhill all the way! When I first came to Sheffield I was worried my car wouldn’t be able to cope with the steep hills, I’d never driven up anything with such an incline before. Over time I’ve become a bit more confident in my driving skills, by clutch control and the reliability of my handbrake, but I still won’t venture out in the car at the first sign of ice. In the UK, it is quite common for people to have driveways outside their houses where they can pull up and park their cars on dedicated off-street parking. Sheffield is no different, but what is different is the angles of those driveways. Local people will think nothing of parking their car on a 45-degree slope that would terrify me. I always thought only a four by four vehicle would be safe negotiating such terrain, here the consensus is otherwise!\n \nHowever, even problems can have unexpected positives associated with them! Walking round Sheffield certainly keeps you fit. I might still puff going up some of the steeper hills, but I can now get up them without stopping. I now take it for granted that everywhere is hilly round me, and although I still can’t work out how it is possible for a route to and from the town centre to apparently be uphill both going out and coming back, I do take it in my stride. I now forget how hilly it is. A few months ago I took part in a half-marathon running race in my home city. The organisers had warned participants that there was a really steep hill section. In fact, it was 6 miles continuously uphill, and then about another 7 miles return undulating back to the start. As we set off, quite soon some runners around me were saying ‘this must be the really steep hill the organisers warned us about’ I was astonished! We were still on a part of the course that in Sheffield terms was flat. The ‘proper’ hill was a long way off, if they thought the route was challenging already, well, oh my, they were in for a shock later on! As a local, I wasn’t necessarily any faster going up those hills, but psychologically at least they didn’t take me by surprise!\n \nWhat is the cause! Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, local geography! There’s not much to be done about that. So when it comes to saying what might be done to ‘solve the problem’ I think it isn’t about ‘solving’ it at all. Rather it is more of an ‘if you can’t beat them, join them’ sort of situation. By which I mean, instead of fretting over what can’t be changed, it’s much better to accept it, and even learn to appreciate it! After all, hard as those hills are to climb, one of the very best things about Sheffield is getting up as high as you can on the edge of the city. Way, way up where the open moors of the Peak District meet the city boundary you get amazing views. In one direction you can see back across the city, and pick out landmarks in amongst the hills. In the others, you can see heather and moor or woodland depending on which way you choose to look. So the hills are a problem, sometimes, but they are also what gives the city its unique character as well as help me in my literal and metaphorical battle to keep fit! Besides, after all, that walking in the open air I think I’ve earned the right for a restorative cup of strong Yorkshire Tea and a slice of cake! So, the hills might be a short-term problem, but they are certainly a long-term gain!"

So, I would like to thank you for this great cue card topic before describing a person, who is older than me and who I also happen to admire.\n\nAhh! the person, I admire and would like to talk about, is one of my former college teachers. I saw and met this great teacher, known as Mr Paul, of mine in my English class about 10 years ago. Initially, I didn’t really make much of him except that he was a good English teacher, and he liked to wear his dark colour sunglasses almost all the times. But, as more and more time passed, I discovered him to be one of the most talented persons I had ever seen.\n\nIn fact, soon after graduating from college, I came to know that he was a multi-lingual person with a great level of fluency in Arabic, French, and Japanese, in addition to English. Then, I also came to know that he had written a number of good books on the history of languages.\n\nBy the way, both I and Mr Paul live in the same city, and I still see him (now old and retired) walking at a local park or visiting a grocery shop to buy groceries. As a man of very little words, he doesn’t really like to engage in unnecessary talks, but he never forgets to remind me that he is very much happy to be alive and still learning at his old age when he is asked about his health. And talking about health, Mr Paul is very serious about his health as he always likes to follow a strict diet.\n\nWhy do I admire him? Well, I admire this great former college teacher of mine mainly because he never gives up on learning new things - academically or otherwise. I admire him also because he has a very good personality and is very respectful to other people around him, whether they are old or young."

This would be without any doubt my brother, John, who is five years senior to me. He is my idol, a person I admire from the bottom of my heart and a great friend of mine.\n\nJohn is an architect and he has been working in a large design and development company for more than 3 years. His academic records are excellent and he is planning to move to Canada next year to further enhance his career. I have got only one brother and that is John.\n\nHe will be 30 in this coming November and has shown a great promise throughout his academic life. My parents and John's teachers have always been optimistic about his becoming a great person in life. I am proud of being his younger brother. Last year John had been a team member of a historically important monument design in our country and a news article described all about the project and people behind this. When I saw John's picture in the newspaper, I was quite happy and excited. He is quite handsome and has got the look of my mother. He is fond of different outdoor sports and I often play football and volleyball with him. \n\nJohn has always been there for me. In my early childhood, he was my best buddy and other children knew that John would always protect me no matter what. In several occasions, John fought for me and I was happy for having such a great brother in my life. Furthermore, he has always been a great mentor and adviser for me. He helped me complete my homework, taught me how to play different indoor and outdoor games and always treated me very kindly. He is a good-mannered and a punctual person and he has tried to instil so many moralities and good habits in me that only a good mentor would do.\n\nMy parents were both busy in their professional life and yet they tried to spend their time with us whenever possible. Despite that, I often missed them and it was John who supported me all the time. Without him, my life would have been much difficult and full of loneliness.\n\nI like and admire him for his well-manner, respect for others, great talent and the unparalleled support he has in my life. I consider him a great person who would help a thousand others through his words and works. I personally feel that having a brother like him is indeed a matter of great pride."

    "Answer": "I am a student of journalism at Murdoch University in Australia. This is really difficult to describe a single person whom I admire but I think Mr Henry Robinson will be the perfect match here.\n\nMr Henry Robinson, the middle-aged person, is a teacher of mine, and he takes the course on investigative journalism. In his career, he was a reputed journalist in his days. Now he teaches journalism at this university. But I adore him for some other reasons. The first and most important thing is that he is able to focus on the deep of any issues and brings out the solution within a short time. Moreover, he is smart enough to deal with unfavourable situations in real-life. He behaves gently with his students and really loves to teach.   \n\nPresently, Mr Robinson is attached with teaching and before entering into this profession, he used to be a journalist. He has worked for a remarkable number of newspaper and news agencies home and abroad. Most of the times, he was in many other countries as a residential correspondent for the newspapers. He left the job in 2010 and been engaged in teaching as he is unwilling to carry the hard and fast duties of journalism anymore. Besides, there were some other hidden issues that triggered his early retirement from journalism which he does not like to share with everyone. Now he is happy with the students and instructs them how to have investigative journalism. We are happy that he makes the lessons clear with his real-life examples. \n\nIn his personal life, this well-behaved man is very simple. But he is proud of his large curly hairs and bigger eyes. He looks dashing when he comes to lecture on the class even in his middle age. He is a bit different from the other teacher at my university and loves teaching without books. As a result, the complex issues are made simpler with discussion and participation of the students. Besides, his approach to students is completely different and he speaks in a very lucid and clear voice. Actually, he is able to enchant the audience with his magical voice. Sometimes he also takes part in television commercials and performs as a voice artist.\n\nI admire him so much because of some particular reasons. He is a great man so far I have ever met in every term. He loves teaching and also inspires his students to learn. He never follows the conventional modes of teaching rather he has his own distinctive style. He helps us to understand lessons instead of memorization. There are some teachers in the university who are unable to create a simple relation with the students and bind them in restrictions. But Mr Robinson is quite opposite in this case. His door is always open for any of the students and he loves advising them even on their real-life problems. Consequently, he has gained popularity among all the batches of journalism. So, it is almost impossible to dislike him for all such reasons."

    "Answer": "I live in a rather small town which doesn’t really have many interesting things to see or places to visit. However, there is one thing, which my small town can boast of, is the existence of a beautiful river garden, and today, I would like to talk about that here.\n\nAnyway, initially, this river garden, as the story goes, used to be privately-owned by some famous landlord of our town, but later on, it was acquired by our local city government about 50 years ago or so. But, whoever is in charge of taking care of this beautiful river garden, which stretches about a couple of hundred metres in length and 50 metres wide on one side of the river coast, I must thank them from the very bottom of my heart because it is a beautiful looking river garden.\n\nMany people, from my town as well as from the outside, visit this magnificent river garden to enjoy the stunning nature. Some even visit it to have some family picnic (not allowed to cook anything there though) and after-wedding photo sessions.\n\nThis river garden contains a collection of differing herbaceous borders which are a mixture of the conventional to some unusual plantings, but it surely offers a great view of the river if looked over from the other side. Besides, the impressive stretch of lawn, just below the garden, leading down to the river also looks distinctly remarkable. By the way, since this river garden is not really far from the city centre, one can easily go there with their own transportations. People can even reach there on feet if they are willing to walk about 30 minutes.\n\nWell, I consider this place to be interesting because it is really old and also has many stories (more like legends) to tell. It is fascinating also because all kinds of people visit this place with only one goal, and that is to just enjoy the exquisite view of a river and the mother nature at its best."

    "Answer": "For my job I currently live in the capital city of our country which is ... (say the name of the capital city in your country...). It has been more than 5 years since I left my hometown and yet this is the town where my heart belongs to. I will always remember the days and places where I spent my childhood and teenage, the golden years of my life. The name of my hometown is (...say the name of your hometown...) and it is located in the northern part of the (... say the city/ district name where this town belongs to...). This town will always be special to me, no matter where I go, how far I go. There are many interesting places if I consider from different perspectives in my hometown that I can recall now. Out of these places, the rail station, which is located in the southern corner of our city is the one I would like to talk about.\n\nIn my childhood, the rail station in my hometown was the most mysterious and interesting place for us. We, as children, were not allowed to enter the main premises where the train stopped and this prohibition made us more curious about this place. This is still a place which is quite interesting to me. This is probably because this rail station is the entry and exit point for me- to and from my hometown. When the train drops me in this station, I feel a sensation of being home. On the contrary, during the time of my departure, I feel an acute melancholy that I won't be able to express in words. This place has always been a mystery to me and it is still a place full of happiness, sadness and enigma.\n\nFrom two other perspectives, this place is quite interesting to me. One- the surrounding view of this station is quite spectacular and would give someone an impression that he is standing on a tall mountain and can see the green fields below all around him. The view gives the first impression of the natural beauty this area has. In fact, I have never seen any other train station which is located in such a higher place and gives such a beautiful view.  Second- the different types of people who come here each day is an interesting thing to observe. Some people come here to sell numerous products, some wait for their relatives or family members to arrive, some to see off their relatives or friends, and finally, some are part of the administrative office of the rail authority. In my opinion, this is an interesting hub for people of different ages, places and purposes.\n\nIf I am to suggest a foreign tourist about the interesting places in my hometown, I would suggest him to start with this rail station. This rail station will give a very good idea for our town, people and places to be there. To me, this is the gateway to a beautiful town where my heart belongs to."

    "Answer": "I live in New York with my parents. There are a good number of interesting places to see and visit here. But the New York Public Library is more interesting to me than any other places.\n\nI am a citizen of the USA by birth but my parents are not. They came here in search of living from Larissa in Greece during the 1980s. They have been living for around 36 years in this city. After my birth and I got matured enough, they took me to different interesting places to visit in New York City, and these places are really interesting. But being an introvert, I disliked the crowds and the public library appeared to be more interesting to me than other places. The place is filled with books on numerous issues, magazines, documents and many other things. The classics available in the library were my favourite.\n\nGoing to the library is easier for me. In fact, this is not far away from my residence. The New York Public Library is only a 10-minute walk from my home. It remains open from 10 am to 8 pm, except for the weekends. Usually, I go there in the evening and read books or novels until the library is closed. Besides, the library is accessible from the other parts of the city. The people who want to visit the library can reach here using several transportation modes. They can reach the library by taxi, metro or by their private cars. But the people who live nearby, like me, come here mostly on foot.       \n\nThe New York Public Library is a great place to read. But the people who come here are not readers always. Some of them are researchers, while some others may be historians or musicians. Actually, the library is visited by a wide range of people. Basically, the library comes with the reading facilities. But there is also the scope to check the reference books, peep on the music directory or crosscheck any history. Besides, the reading rooms are well expanded and the readers have ample opportunities to use the books and references after their needs. But they have to be careful with the books. Silence among the readers while reading books is expected there.\n\nReading books may appear boring to many but it is very interesting to me. I love reading books. The books help us to know the unknown and unseen. The experiences of the past thousand years have been preserved in books in words. So, when I read them, it appears that I am travelling through time! But every place is not suitable for reading and it requires a very special environment. Hence, I think the library is a nice place to read. At the same time, it is an interesting place as an enriched collection of books are available together. In fact, it is impossible for an individual to collect a part of the books of this library in his entire life. So, I find more interest in reading books in a calm place and the New York Public Library is a place I would recommend to a tourist."

    "Answer": "I have had a number of interesting trips within my country, but never really got a chance to visit outside of my country. However, I do dream of having a special trip to one of the European countries in near future, and today, I would like to talk about that here.\n\nOn this special trip, I would like to go to England which had become the epicentre of the world in the early 19th century and remained so for the next one century, as far as the political power and industrial revolution are concerned. Of course, I have heard and read many other things about this great country, but learning them from someone else or reading them on some books is certainly not the same as seeing them with your own eyes.\n\nBy the way, here it is worth mentioning that a distant uncle of mine, who treats me like his own nephew, lives in London, but whenever he visits us, he never forgets to tell me and my family that we were more than welcome to visit him in London and live with them as long as we would stay there. But, that’s, of course, easier being said than done, as far as I am concerned. After all, it would take a great deal of preparation from my part, including saving enough money for the trip and getting a long enough of a vacation time from my work.\n\nBesides, I would also need to find a suitable place to stay because I just don’t like to stay with my distant uncle and bother him with my presence at his place. But whatever preparation I need to take, I sure will visit England in the next 6 months or so.\n\nAnyway, this would be a special trip, mainly because it would be the first trip outside of my country. Besides, this trip would also allow me to learn about a country and its culture, which has made a tremendous impact on other countries of the world, from up close."

    "Answer": "I love to travel and being in a new place is quite a sensational experience for me. I have visited more than 10 countries and most of the famous places in my homeland. However, most of my trips were either solo or with friends. A few months ago I planned a very special trip that I would like to go on in the near future. I want to visit (... a sea beach name in your country...) and take my parents on this very special trip. The main reason this would be a special trip is that my parents would be with me and this would be the first time they will visit the largest sea beach in our country. Having my parents with me there would make it special. It's been more than 7 years when we had our last trip together.\n   \nProbably we will have this special trip in the next January. I will take a few days off from my office and would prepare for the trip. This would be 6-8 hours journey and we would prefer to travel by train rather than a bus. My parents are also very excited about the journey and they are also looking forward to going on this trip.  \n\nWe do not need much preparation for this trip as this would a short trip and we would be staying for only 4-5 days, I guess. We would only need to be concerned about the weather condition and pick clothes that are suitable for the summer season. We will start this trip from the city train station and our preference would be to book a first-class compartment of the train. The train journey is usually pleasant in our country and we will have the chance to enjoy the scenic beauty on both sides of our route.\n\nAfter we arrive at the destination, we will first reserve a nice hotel for us that will have the view of the sea beach. If we take the train at around 6:00 in the morning, we will reach there just before 2:00 pm, I assume. We will have our lunch and take rest for a couple of hours. In the afternoon we will go and enjoy the sea beach and stay for a couple of hours there. We will also enjoy the sea-foods from a renowned restaurant and get back to our hotel at night. During this trip, we will visit two other nearby famous tourists destinations and enjoy our stay there. We will buy some gifts for other family members and relatives and enjoy the whole trip."

    "Answer": "The enjoyment of travelling is exceptional indeed, and when I am to describe a future travelling plan, I am delighted to almost the same extent. Here is a brief description of the special trip that I intend to have in future.\n\nI am planning the trip next summer. In fact, I will take leave from my office for the entire summer. I have not been taking leaves for the past one year and have been working like a machine. Even I had worked in the office on the weekends to meet some emergencies. Now, I am badly in need of great refreshment and the trip will help me to get refreshed. The trip will begin from the very first day of summer vacation and will last around a month.\n\nI am an NGO worker here and live with my parents. So, I am planning to visit any of the European countries, particularly Italy, with my parents. They have not been out of South Africa for a long time. Besides, I have conducted minor research that Italy is the most attractive place to visit. The country contains a notable number of natural visiting places with beautiful landscapes. Moreover, the lakes of the country are excellent with their bluish water. The foods are delicious and almost all types of foods are available here. Besides, this is a destination for global tourists. Considering all these facts, I have planned to have a trip to Italy.      \n\nInitially, I have selected some of the most visiting spots in Italy. But all the other preparations are still remaining. I am unable to manage time for the preparations. I have to renew my passport in line with the passports of my parents. This is really a hefty task. Then I have to arrange for visas though this is not a problem at all and manageable within one day. Then appears the issues of collecting maps for the locations I want to visit. Changing the currency is another potential issue to be considered. So, before starting the trip, I have to collect the changed currencies or it will be difficult to meet the expenses in Italy. Booking aeroplane tickets is another important issue. I have to book tickets at least 15 days before the trip. So far, these are the necessary preparations that I need to take.\n\nThis would be a very special trip as I am travelling with my parents for the first time out of the state. In fact, this would a family trip where all three family members will be present together for the first time. Earlier, I was unable to manage time for such a trip and could not dare to even plan for. It was my occupational engagement that made me separated from my family. Only we met at the table at night during supper. So, I made the plan to have the trip for a long time so that we could spend some quality moments together in a very special place. In view of all such aspects, this would be a special trip for me."

    "Answer": "I have had the opportunities to read some good stories which are written by some famous writers from my own country as well as from other parts of the world. But, I have always preferred to read stories of the writers from my own country since they more directly relate to my own culture and lifestyle, and today, I would like to talk about one such story.\n\nAnyway, the story, I read, was about an epic struggle of a farmer who had fought well over a decade against the existence of a very brutal feudal system in his own village. By the way, unlike many European countries as well as the other parts of the world, the feudal system was very much alive in my country even before a couple of hundred years ago or so. And the story was written based on these troubled times when hundreds of thousands of farmers of my country pretty much had to live on the mercy of the many brutal landlords who didn’t know anything except the absolute loyalty of their subjects called the “peasants”.\n\nBut, whenever their subjects (i.e. Poor farmers) failed to abide by their harsh feudal system, as the story said, these cruel landlords used to torture them until a complete submission from them was offered. But, then came this poor but very brave farmer who didn’t only refuse to submit but also organized a revolt against his landlord. Eventually, the brave farmer had died, but so did the landlord. By the way, I bought the storybook and read it about a year ago before visiting a historically famous village in my country.\n\nAnyway, this story was interesting to me mainly because it has managed to depict the picture of a village of my country and the lifestyles of the villagers there in such a beautiful and realistic manner. Besides, the story also reminded me of a very sombre fact that a huge sacrifice was made by our ancestors to make our country a peaceful place to live."

    "Answer": "Every story is taken either from human experience or from human imagination and when a story is told, the audiences and readers try to connect it with their own experience or creative thinking. Thus each story is a great one and interesting if this is told to the right audiences in the right tone. An interesting story that I would like to talk about for this cue card topic is not taken from someone's imagination; rather it is taken from a real event. I heard this story from one of my uncles and he told me this story in my childhood and this is still an inspiring story for me.\n\nThis is a story about a man who risked his life to save others from an imminent disaster or more accurately from death. It was 1995 and a massive hurricane stroke in the (...say the name of a suburban/ rural area...). As soon as the hurricane hit, the disaster and destruction were everywhere. Many people died and many were injured. Yet many others were trapped in and needed to be rescued and hospitalised immediately. Though there were many rescue workers who were working ceaselessly, they did not have enough time to save all the trapped people. At that time a man named Thomas came forward and made a group of young people in order to arrange a rescue team. Thomas himself was more than 50 years old, yet he had been able to motivate 10-12 other young men of this area to help the trapped people within a very short time.  \n\nThey worked really hard for more than 24 hours and as I heard from my uncle, more than 30 people were rescued due to the brave initiative of Thomas. My uncle was one of the team members of this rescue team and every time he mentioned Thomas, I could feel great respect in his voice. It was a great tragedy that Thomas lost his wife and only son in a devastating earthquake a few years later and left the area to settle in a different city. People of this area will always remember his bravery and great courage, at least for the next few decades.  \n\nI have read and heard many other interesting stories but Thomas and his team did something extraordinary and I will always remember how good people among us work selflessly to help others."

    "Answer": "Reading stories is always preferable to me and it is a delight to talk about one of the very best and most interesting stories I have ever read. Now I will discuss the novel - 'The Old Man and the Sea' which appears a very interesting and intriguing story to me.\n\nThis is a short novel by Ernest Hemingway. It was written in 1951 and was published in the following year. The entire story is about the struggle of an old man who lives by fishing and how he deals with a large marlin in the sea. In fact, the old fisherman underwent troubles in fishing and was unable to get the desired amount of fish to make his living. He passed 84 days in such condition and on the 85th day, he started a long journey on the sea to change his luck. Though he came in close contact with a large marlin, he was unable to bring the living fish on the shore. The fish was consumed by sharks on his way back home.    \n\nI read the story from the private library of my father. He has a huge collection of books, novels, old documents. He gathered all the books since he was 20. But he did not allow me to read all the books at the earliest stages of my life. Rather he prescribed some of them to me and I guess he wanted me to read books that were suitable for my age. Consequently, he asked me to check the book titled – The Old Man and the Sea when I was 15 years old. I was attracted to the cover page of the book. Though dad said that the book was a novel for all ages, I was surprised by its size and shape. In fact, I was unaware that the book was a short novel. Then I started reading the novel and completed reading it in a single sitting.\n\nActually, I was passing lazy days that summer. Most of my college mates were out of the city to pass the summer. So, I had nothing to do except reading books and playing video games on my computer. Besides, my dad also left the city for his business. So, I made a phone call and asked for his suggestions to pass the days. He then suggested me reading the book. Following his directives, I bought the book from his library. He also asked me to keep the book in the place I took it from. I followed all of his instructions once the book was read.   \n\nThe Old Man and the Sea is one of the greatest works in the arena of literature and I think the best work of Ernest Hemingway. The book brought him fame and contributed to achieving the Noble Prize as well. The plot of the story was interesting and intriguing. There are twists and thrills in the story. The story is about an unfortunate old Cuban fisherman, Santiago and how he tried hard to change his luck. His struggles to change his fishing luck and how he finally came to meet his dream. Unfortunately, the dream partially came into being. Besides, this is the story that was an influential one that has held Hemingway to win the Pulitzer Prize for the fictional story plot. For all such reasons, the story appears interesting to me."

Just like every other people, I also have to buy things for myself and my family, and it’s not that I always feel happy about my choices or purchases. But, today, I would like to talk about buying a product which really made me happy.\n\nAnyway, the product, I bought that made me feel happy, was a vacuum cleaner for my home which I bought about 3 years ago. I needed to buy the vacuum cleaner because the old one, we had, got damaged because my 3 years old little nephew had poured water in it, apparently because he thought he needed to clean it!\n\nIt is worth mentioning here that it was for the first time that I bought a vacuum cleaner, so I was really very sceptic about it since I had almost no or very little knowledge about it. But, however, it turned out to be a really good product in the end. Interestingly, this vacuum cleaner had a beautiful and shiny magenta colour, and it also felt rather light to carry, even though it was relatively bigger than a standard size family vacuum.\n\nOf course, I will have to thank my sister-in-law in a big way for managing to purchase such a nice vacuum cleaner because it was her suggestion, after all, who had told me about what kind of vacuum cleaner I should have bought. She was also kind enough to give me some hints about the brands or the name of companies which manufactured the best kinds of vacuum cleaners.\n\nI was really happy to buy this product, mainly because it ran and still running without giving any kind of troubles whatsoever! I was happy for this nice looking vacuum cleaner also because it didn’t really make much sound like many other vacuum cleaners in the market. Finally, it also had some great safety features if my little nephew wanted to “clean” it (again)!"

Well, I can remember many such experiences, however, after I bought a washing machine for my mother, I was exhilarated.\n\nMy mother is a housewife and she does a lot for all of us. She is like a comfortable shadow in our life on a hot summer day. We quite often forget to tell her how much we love her and sometimes we do not even thank her for things she does. But without her, our life would simply be a disaster. After I started my job, I had a plan to buy her something. I saved some money each month and then after a few months, I decided to buy her a washing machine so that she no longer needs to do her laundry manually. I thought that would save her from some tedious weekly works and would allow her to enjoy more leisure hours.\n\nOne day I went to a large LG showroom and selected a medium-size washing machine. It was a bit expensive for me to afford at that time but I bought it anyway. After I reached home with this washing machine and surprised everybody with this sudden commodity, I realised how exhilarating it is to be able to make others happy. My mother was very excited that I astounded her this way. She asked me to teach her how to operate it and then cooked some special dishes at night to make the event memorable. This was probably something she wished to own and when I bought it for her, she was very amazed... She was also worried that I had to spend a large sum of money to buy it, but I told her that it is something I always planned to do with my salary.  \n\nAfter that, I have bought many products and electronic gadgets for me or for others, but being able to surprise my mother with my first earned salary was something very special. The washing machine I bought worked fine for more than 5 years and it was then replaced with a newer one. However, my memory regarding this first washing machine at our home was something I will never forget."

I am very happy with the laptop.\n\nI am the eldest daughter of my family and live with them here in Islamabad, Pakistan. Recently I have got a job and found that I have to perform some tasks at home. Besides, it has become impossible for me to use the internet with my old cell phone. Considering everything, I have bought a laptop from the ASUS brand shop. Though I saved a portion of money from sources like private tuition for the laptop for a long time, the best opportunity came when I got appointed to this multinational company. I added the remaining from my salary and brought the laptop home.\n\nThis is the age of technology and using the internet with mobile phones is not very efficient. Someone may browse the internet or social networking websites temporarily on a mobile network, but that is not suitable for any large scale jobs. Often I have to perform some official tasks using the internet and this is almost impossible by using the cell phone. Besides, I like watching movies for recreational purposes and my cell phone is unable to come with such support for me. Moreover, my parents are religious and they love listening recitation from the Holy Quran and a laptop can serve this best. Considering all such matters, I decided to get a laptop but unfortunately could not manage the entire amount. So, when I got the salary, I bought it in the first attempt.   \n\nI have bought a laptop last month and have been using for around three weeks. By this time, the laptop has proved its worth. It has an outstanding charging back up and the battery lasts for seven hours approximately once it is charged completely. Besides, my parents are also using it and they are happy too. I planned to use the internet modem but my father has arranged a broadband internet connection. So, using the internet is no longer a problem for us. I have two younger sisters and they are also careful about using the laptop. They mostly use the laptop when I am not home and watch cartoons and animated movies on the internet. My mother takes care of the laptop and she is responsible for keeping it safe and clean from dust.\n\nI was really happy to buy this laptop. It may sound weird that it was a dream for me. I have realised the necessity of a laptop when I was at my university. I was unable to complete projects and assignments. I had to rely on my friends who had their own laptops. Though they cordially allowed me to use their laptops, I felt uncomfortable most of the time. On the other side, my father was not rich enough to spend some extra bucks for me to buy a laptop. So, I had planned to have a piece of this device. After lots of struggles, I got the job and finally have my own laptop. So, I am extremely happy to own it and with its so far performance and utilisation."

But, the news here, I am about to share, is certainly interesting as far as its news value is concerned.\n\nAnyway, this piece of local news was aired on one of our national TV channels just a few weeks ago. This local news was related to the tough life of an old lady, in her early 70’s, who earns her living by selling local newspapers in my very hometown. By the way, I have seen this lady, in her old clothes, in my home town myself on a number of occasions but never really felt the need to talk to her or buy any newspaper from her. Instead, I have just thought of her as a mentally ill person who could use our help.\n\nIronically enough though, it is her steel-strong determination of not seeking any help from anybody to survive, as the TV news had described, that brought her story in the light. Of course, many people had tried to help her, but she has refused to accept their help, apparently because she thought that it was a disgrace to accept other peoples’ help and that she was very happy living like that for over the last 30 years. On top of that, it is her who have helped many helpless and poor people from the very insignificant amount of money that she earns by selling newspapers.\n\nMainly, I found the piece of news to be interesting because it made me realize that even though we don’t value many people in our society because of their “purposeless life”, ironically, it seems that these are the people who seem to have a greater sense of self-respect. Besides, the news also had taught me that it doesn’t really take much money to help others but it is the heart of a person which is needed the most to heal and help others."

    "Answer": "Ahh! an interesting topic indeed. For this cue card topic, I would like to talk about a piece of interesting and captivating local news that I read in a newspaper. It would be more than 5 years ago, I assume, when I read this news in a local newspaper called (...say a newspaper name common in your country…).  \n\nIn a fine morning, I opened the newspaper, like any other usual day, and found a news story that caught my eyes. It was about a giant animal that people had seen on the streets after midnight and many of them believed that it was a ghost and could change its shape. The story even included some local people's interviews who told the reporter that they saw this mysterious animal and shape-shifter with their own eyes. The length of the news and its coverage with pictures were evidence that it was getting some attention, at least to local people who like to gossip and believe strange stories. The reporter also gave a hint that some recent crimes that the policemen were still struggling to solve might have been connected with this unknown animal!  \n\nI am not a person who can be easily convinced with such baseless stories. However, I must give the reporter some credit to be able to present the news very interestingly. The report did not mention a single time that such ghost story is mostly fabricated and exaggerated. Rather it tried to convince the readers that there was some solid ground of this news and people should be careful at night. However, the reporter also reported his doubt about the authenticity of people's opinion. Clever indeed, to attract both type of readers - believers and non-believer of ghosts!  \n\nThe report also included that some people have informed the nearby police station that a child was missing and they saw a giant beast around the house of this child. However, the reporter cleverly avoided the fact that it was some hearsay, not confirmed by the police. The story that I read ended with mystery and uncertainty. I would say it was quite engaging and this was mostly because of how it was presented to the readers rather than the facts of the story.  \n\nBefore I end, I would like to tell you about the findings of this ghost story that was published at least 3 weeks later. The giant animal was a big panther who was sick and fled from a nearby zoo. The authority caught it in a week. The missing child was found after 2 days and this was a common missing-child case. Finally, the people who fabricated the story somehow got busy with other such cock-and-bull stories."

    "Answer": "Batticaloa is a city with less interesting events but the recent event of saving lives by a teenage boy, Kushal, had created great excitement among the local citizens. In fact, this is really interesting news for me and for most others in our city.\n \nDue to the simplicity and ordinary living style of the local people, exciting events are very few here and so, whenever there are some excitements, the events turn exclusive. The event took place last Thursday when Kushal was able to stop a bus immediately before an accident. The accident might have caused some serious detrimental impacts on the passengers and the bystanders. In fact, the bus driver was unable to identify the newly dug holes on the roads which were unmarked by the workers.\n\nI heard the news on the local television channel on the evening of the same day. The television channel publicised it as a special report periodically and described thoroughly from the beginning to the last. The reporter also praised highly of the ready wit, smartness and bravery of Kushal. Generally, the drivers stop their vehicles when they see a red signal and sensing the accident, the boy arranged for a piece of red cloth to stop the bus. The news was telecasted around the day but I was unable to know about it in the daytime for my class. After returning home, I sat before the TV to enjoy a special reality show, and it was then when I came to know about this particular event.  \n\nThe news presenter began the news with an exciting tone that a highly interesting event took place on the day. Then he gradually described the courage of the boy and how he managed to stop a tourist bus on a sideways in the city. Actually, the bus driver was a novice in his job and was assigned to make a tour of the city with foreign guests. Being unskilled, he was unable to trace the holes on the road which were meant for the road extension. The workers were on a break as it was the breakfast hour and so they did not put any mark beside the holes. So, the bus driver moved towards the hole while Kushal noticed that. So, he managed a red cloth from somewhere and stood in front of the extension zones, waved the red cloth and the speedy bus stopped just before him.\n\nThe event was really interesting as it contained some excitements. Despite being a major city of Sri Lanka, the events in the city are dull and boring. The citizens are bored with the local news of export, import and other agricultural issues. In fact, we lead a routine-bound life which has made life tiring. So, whenever there is something exciting, we become excited. The bravery of Kushal was the same for us, especially his heroic stance to stop the bus was praiseworthy. He stood before a speedy bus which could have hit him and resulting in his death or any other serious injury. The entire event has thrilled us all and so it was interesting to me."

    "Answer": "Well, this is such a challenging topic for me. In fact, I don’t really like to take my pictures or talk about them since I very seldom look good in my pictures. But, still, I would like to pick a picture from the archive of my memory which I took about 16 years ago.\n\nAnyway, back then, I was just a young boy and I had just started to explore the world around me. In fact, as a young school-going boy, I was curious about a lot of things, which included things like how fishes could swim in the water, and how aeroplanes could fly in the sky. But, out of all those things, which would interest me so much, one of the things, which I was really curious about, was how to make binoculars.\n\nIn fact, I was so curious about making a binocular myself that my family actually was forced to buy me a couple of magnifying glasses, a cardboard tube, duct tape and a scissor so that I could make my own binocular. I am sure that by now you have probably already guessed that the picture I am talking about has something to do with making a binocular, and you are right, as it indeed is. In fact, I took a picture of me, holding my binocular, which I made all on my own after a marathon tries for almost one week! And the camera, used by my father, to take that picture was called “Kodak” if I remember correctly. By the way, I took the picture because I wanted to preserve the rare moment of displaying my “creativity” as a child!\n\nAnyway, I think that I like this picture, mainly because it is one of the very pictures where I looked unusually happy and confident. Besides, I like this because it tells the story of a little boy who was loved by his parents, no matter how “unreasonable” his request might have been to them some times."

    "Answer": "Well, these days such photographs are called 'selfie' and I did not know that there was something called selfie until I turned to 23! Selfie is indeed a craze these days while it was unheard of in the past, at least to me. The photograph that I would like to talk about was not a so-called selfie that teenagers take these days using the front camera of their mobile phones. I took this picture many years ago when I was around 12 years old with a large Canon camera. \n\nMy father gave me this camera on my 12th birthday and this was the first time when I owned a camera. I loved to capture pictures of my relatives and beautiful sceneries. We had to use a rolled film at that time called ‘roll film’ and did not have the freedom to take as many photos as we wanted unlike the digital camera owners have these days.  \n\nOne day I was invited to one of my friends' birthday party and his parents requested me to bring my camera with me. I took many photos at that party and at night when I returned from the party, I noticed that 2-3 film strips were still empty and I could take more photos before I send the film roll to be washed and printed. At that time I was in my room and could not find anything suitable to capture. I was standing in front of the looking glass and the idea of taking my own picture popped into my head. It was a Canon CF-23 model camera and had only 3-4 options to adjust the light and flash while taking a photo. I had to spend more than 5 minutes to capture the picture and after I saw the printed version of this photo, I loved it.  \n\nThe picture shows me standing straight and holding a camera in front of my eyes. The backlight was visible and was more like a shining star in the sky. A part of the room was visible but everything in the opposite direction as it was through the mirror. I like this photo very much. It was taken by me, the idea was new, at least to me and the photo looks nice. My mother has this picture in her picture album and every time I see this photo, it reminds me of my teenage days."

    "Answer": "Photography is indeed an art and requires a lot of perseverance to click the right photo at the right moment. Recently, I have taken a photo of mine with my phone which is also an example for me how difficult it is to capture a photo of oneself using the primary camera of the mobile phone.\n\nI took the photo last week when I attended a marriage ceremony of a cousin. This is the selfie-age and it is easier to get a selfie than any other thing. But I wanted something different. I am a girl who has recently graduated from the University of Kuala Lumpur and for the outstanding result, my dad bought me a smartphone. I heard about the top class photo from the camera of my device, iPhone 6s+, but did not have the chances to check the quality in a professional manner. So, I took the photo in that event to test the camera.\n\nBasically, the mobile phone camera has been used to get the photo clicked. This is a standard mobile phone camera that comes with some special features like face detection, flash, geo-tagging and more others. The primary camera itself belongs to 12 megapixels while the front camera (used for video calling and self-images) is 5 megapixels. This was a great experience for me as I have never used such a wonderful mobile device before. I, in fact, had no idea that image would be so nice though I had to struggle enough to click the photo. The image quality is of a high standard and the pixels do not get saturated even if the images are taken with zooming from the device.\n\nI took the photo out of my hobby. Usually, everyone takes photos of others using the front cameras of their mobile phone and it is really difficult to get the right picture of oneself using the primary camera. This is a blind try. It often happens that the object on the photos are not in the right place or there are some unwanted objects on the photos which need to be removed by editing. In a word, it is troublesome unless someone is clicking for you. But I made the almost impossible thing to possible. It was a kind of challenge for me to click the right photo entirely based on my intuition.\n\nOf course, I like the photo and this is one of the greatest photos in my life. This is a great picture for me and I desire to print and bind. The picture shows that I am standing on a stunning dress before an illuminated garden. Some distant objects have also been captured but those were blurred for focusing on me only. Interestingly, it is impossible to understand that I took the photo using the primary camera of the phone. Though my cousins asked me to capture some moments for me with the phone, I did not allow them and instead took the photos by myself. But I think if the distant objects could have removed, the photo would look more beautiful."

    "Answer": "Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to tell something on this great cue card topic. Actually, I am truly blessed to know a number of great families, and today, I would like to talk about one such family who I have known for a long time.\n\nThe family, I am talking about here, is none other than the family of a very good friend of mine. I have known them since my childhood when both I and my friend used to attend the same elementary school.\n\nHowever, even though, both I and my friend became close friends right after meeting each other at our elementary school, I didn’t really have a chance to meet the whole family of my friend until after they had come to watch an annual sports competition of our school, which was actually long time after I had met my friend. Needless to say, immediately after meeting them at my elementary school, I started to like the whole family of my friend, which included his parents, three elder brothers and a couple of younger sisters (yes, my friend has a big family). By the way, one of the remarkable things about my friend’s family is that they always like to spend a lot of money in travelling and buying gifts for other people, even though, they may not necessarily be that rich.\n\nAnyway, since meeting them for the first time on that day, there had been hardly any week when I didn’t visit them at their place or one of my friend’s family member didn’t visit my family, even though, both my family and my friend’s family live at a fairly long distance from each other.\n\nWell, I like this family, mainly because each and every one of its member treated me like their own. In fact, since meeting them a long time ago, I can’t remember of a major festival of my country during which they didn’t buy me a gift or invite me to their place to have a family feast."

    "Answer": "Umm... that's an interesting topic, I would say. There are many families I know about and I am very close to some of these families, but I have never thought that I would have to describe such a family. Well, I think describing Emma and her family would be more convenient and natural for me as she is one of my best friends and I know her family very closely.  \n\nEmma has a family with 5 members- her parents, she, Jonathan who is 11 and Emma's sister Paula, who is a doctor. They live only 5 blocks away from our house and as a friend, I know Emma for more than 15 years. They moved here some 16 years ago and they often visit our house, I would say at least once a week. Emma is a talented girl with an excellent academic record. The reason she is a very good friend of mine because of her tender nature and friendly attitude. The first time I met her, I found her very sociable, easygoing, gregarious and cordial. Since then we two are close friends.  \n\nHer father, Mr Alex is an architect and would be around 48 years old. He is working in a large private company and stay out of the town most of the time. When he is not working, he remains busy in his garden. He is quite a devoted gardener and I must state that he has got the finest garden on our block. He does not speak much but I had few conversations with him and I found him quite intelligent and he has a sense of humour that makes him more friendly than he appears to be.\n\nEmma's mother is a school teacher and she teaches English literature in grade 7. She is a beautiful woman who loves every living soul. She is also a great cook. She has a natural talent for cooking a variety of food items and this makes her very famous among our friends. Some dishes she made for us was completely unknown to us and she brought the opportunity for us to taste those for the first time in my life. Her father was a photographer and she travelled a lot in her early age in different parts of the world including Asia, Africa and Europe. She is more like her eldest daughter Paula than Emma.\n\nI guess Emma is a fine mixture of both of her parents and that makes her an excellent person. She is my friend for a long and we two have a very close relationship as two close friends. I find her very curious and her amiable behaviour and polite way of speaking make her very cordial and affectionate.\n\nPaula, Emma’s sister’ is a doctor and she is married to a doctor as well. She had two children who are both in their elementary schools. As Paula lives with her husband, I have met her only twice and know very little about her. She is beautiful and blunter than Emma.\n\nFinally, Jonathan, the youngest member of the family, is in grade 5 and he is full of new ideas and joy. He always smiles, plays and talks and has a good relationship with me. I like him very much due to his frankness and his respect for anyone who is senior to him. As he stated he wants to become a great detective like Sherlock holmes someday.\n \nThis is a good family that anyone would expect as his neighbour. We often visit Emma's family and have family parties. Our family members have a close and friendly relationship with Emma's family and surprisingly Emma's father talks a lot when he is with my father. Probably they love to discuss things together and have common interests and topics to talk about."

    "Answer": "Family life in Australia is a bit imperilled and the number of single-parent families is on the rise. But I think the family living the opposite direction to my apartment is luckier than the other ordinary Australian families.\n\nI like the family of Mr Jonathon Smith. The family is just in the opposite direction of my apartment I am living in with my parents. Mr Smith is a lawyer while his wife, Mrs Smith, is a school teacher. Both of them are highly educated and thus they know the value of living together in a family. They also exercise all the other necessary customs for living peacefully in a family. In fact, I have never seen them getting engaged in a quarrel whereas almost all the other families have such events and unfortunately those are so frequent that play an influential role to be separated.\n\nMr Smith lives with his wife, two daughters and a son. The son is the younger member of the family and aged between 13 to 15. In fact, the boy is a junior friend to me and often comes to have chats with me in my leisure hours. One of the daughters, Martha is my classmate in college while the other one is junior to me. Besides, the family has a cook cum maid who looks after everything for the extreme business of both Mr and Mrs Smith. But they complete all of their activities during the daytime so that they could spend quality time with their kids. \n\nThe family of Mr Smith is highly social which may appear unconventional to the strangers. They greet the new tenants of the apartment complex and on such an occasion, my family got familiar with them. The bond between the two families has been made stronger for internal communication. In fact, Mr Smith is very helpful in nature and a man of his words. Besides, his wife is also kind to others and be with them in every ‘situation’. So, they have gained popularity in the apartment complex and everyone rushes to them when they are in any sort of distress. Such really peace-loving families are numbered in the country.\n   \nI like Mr Smith and his family for few reasons. The first thing is their cordial love to others and adjustment with the situations. I have experienced some events where all the family members of Mr Smith had superb coordination among them, internally, which saved them from embarrassment. Besides, they are peace-loving and do not get engaged in any trouble with the other tenants of the complex, though they own the apartment they are living in. Parenting of their kids is the most impressive aspect of them. Both Mr and Mrs Smith spend enough time with their daughters and sons and share different things. They maintain a complete balance among everything that can impact their family life and living. For all such reasons, they appear to be a perfect family for me and I like them very much."

    "Answer": "Air pollution is a big problem in many, many cities around the world, where the authorities just don’t seem to know how to deal with it effectively. Today, I would like to talk about one such place – a residential area rather - which is also struggling with this air pollution problem.\n\nAnyway, the place, I want to talk about, is located close to one of the major industrial areas of Cairo which I visited about a couple of years ago in order to meet a good friend of mine. I met this good friend of mine on my first visit to Egypt when I went there to see one of the 7th wonders of the world – The Pyramid.\n\nBy the way, since I had visited Cairo a couple of times before my most recent visit, I was already aware of the terrible – I mean, really terrible - air pollution situation of the city, but little did I know that the air pollution problem in the particular area, where my friend lived, was even worse. In fact, within only a few days of arriving at my friend’s place, I started to have a mild cough, along with a blocked nose, due to harmful particles like dust, dirt, soot smoke and liquid droplets that could found in the air of that residential area.\n\nBesides, I also noticed that a number of trees there looked colourless and lifeless because of the negative effects of air pollution there. In addition to that, a very thin layer of “dust-like” thing could also be noticed on many buildings there which made the buildings look essentially old and worn out.\n\nAnyway, one of the main reasons for such air pollution of that residential area was that it was a bit too close to one of the major industrial areas of Cairo where dozens of heavy and large industries could be found operating. After all, the smoke and other toxic chemicals, released from the industries there, spread not only over the residential area of my friend but also all over Cairo City."

    "Answer": "Thank you for letting me talk about this topic. Last year I went to visit (...say an area name in your city/country...) with two of my friends and thought we would enjoy our trip. We heard from a teacher that this was a beautiful place to visit and after that, we planned to go there. To our surprise, this place was severely affected by pollution and instead of enjoying our trip, we cut it short and returned home immediately.\n \nIt was early summer last year and visiting a place near a river which is surrounded by natural beauty and recommended by one of our favourite teachers was an excellent idea, at least at that time. I am sure the teacher who suggested this place had no idea about the severity of the pollution there and how things have become worse.\n \nThe water pollution was quite severe there and the black and greasy elements that were floating on the water created a shocking scene. Uncontrolled waste management, toxic elements from factories and industries, motorised vehicles running on the water and the lack of proper maintenance of the riverside are the main reasons the water has got polluted. More shockingly, the air pollution was also noticeable. I saw many industries and factories that were exhausting black fumes and that has made the air polluted more than any other part I know about.  \n\nUncontrolled urbanisation, the establishment of new factories & industries without proper planning, lack of strict policy and corruption in government offices are so far the main reasons for increasing pollution in our country. I wish this will stop and we will be conscious enough not to destroy our own inhabitants."

    "Answer": "My recent trip to Mumbai gave me a horrific experience! The water of the Mithi River has been polluted to its greatest extent for several reasons. The river, also known as Mahim River, is connected to the Arabian Sea and it was formerly used as a bird sanctuary.\n\nThe river is located beside the Salsette Island in Mumbai. This is a seasonal river that swells up during the monsoon only and remains like a creek around the other months of the year. Presently, the condition of the river has deteriorated for the discharge of different chemicals and wastages from different sources that fall on the water of Mithi River. Before being polluted to this extent, the river served the role of the stormwater drain for Mumbai city.\n\nI went to Mumbai to take part in an admission test at a college. I have completed my secondary level and now aim to get admitted to any reputed college in Mumbai. I live with my family here in Kolkata and some of our intimate relatives live in Mumbai who invited me to attend the entrance exams. As this was my trip out of the Kolkata, my living place, my cousin took me out to show the entire city of Mumbai. But it was not possible for us to see all the notable things in a single day, and thus we made a plan to visit only the most remarkable places at a time. As part of the plan, my cousin took me near the bank of River Mithi. I was astonished by the current scenarios of the river. Thinks have changed negatively than the last time I saw this river!\n\nIt seems that the residents of the city have no idea how the water of the river got polluted. Most of the polluting sources are the raw sewage that had been discharged into the water from sources like mills, factories, households etc. Moreover, the river water is also being polluted for cleaning animals on water, water vessels, releasing unsafe chemicals, organic wastes, animal wastes from cattle sheds, scraps, industrial waste, dumping garbage etc. Those have seriously contributed to the pollution of the water. As a result, the water is unusable now. Besides, the pollution is a great threat to the marine life of the river. But before the pollution, the river was a great place to visit and the banks were occupied in the evening hours by crowds to enjoy natural beauty. Unfortunately, those days are over and now the river bank stinks.\n\nThe pollution of the water is the outcome of some unplanned activities by both the government and residents of the city. A substantial number of industries have been set in the city and they discharge all their chemicals, garbage and other wastages on the water of Mithi River. Besides, there are some unplanned establishments near the river bank which also contributed to polluting the water by throwing waste materials here. The river is always seen busy with the cleaning of vessels, oil drums and some parts of the river is covered with water hyacinth. The combination of industrial wastes, sewage and other garbage dumped on the water has made it almost dirty, unusable and unhealthy. It appears that this is the detrimental impact of urbanisation and industrialisation together."

    "Answer": "This is such an important topic to ponder over every once in a while. So, I would be more than happy today to talk about a person (and his job) who I think has a far greater impact on our society than any other person or professional.\n\nAnyway, the person, I want to talk about, is a policeman and also a cousin of mine, who has been working in the police force for more than 5 years. Now, I don’t really want to put my police cousin in any negative light, but initially, I didn’t really like him to work in the police force because I thought that it would complicate his relationship with his family and friends by essentially turning himself into an “unsocial” fellow.\n\nAfter all, as a policeman, he would almost always need to deal with all kinds of “bad” elements of our society. But, as time went on, and I found how hard and tirelessly he works in order to keep the good citizens of our country safe and secured from dangerous and criminal activities, I had no other choice but to change my mind about the job of a police officer.\n\nOf course, some would argue that in a first-world country, like ours, police has a rather limited role to play since we all more or less are law-abiding citizens, but that may not necessarily be true always. In fact, after seeing my good cousin how he helps the elderly walk out of a grocery store and find her car in a parking lot, and helping a little, lost kid to find his parents in a stadium, I know that a police officer does a lot more than just keeping the bad elements of society at bay.\n\nAnyway, I think, the job my cousin does is important to society because it is the dedication and hard works of police personnel, like my cousin, that we have managed to thrive and peacefully coexist in a beautiful country like ours. Besides, it is usually the police people who always extend their helping hands whenever we are in any kind of danger or distress."

    "Answer": "Every honest job is noble in my opinion if it somehow helps others. While police officers risk their lives to protect the people and ensure the law and order, lawyers defend the innocents or prove a criminal guilty. Likewise, politicians devote their time and life for the greater good of the country, doctors heal our illness, scientists and researchers put our civilisation one step forward and this list goes on and on. However, for this cue card topic, I would like to talk about a person who is a teacher and in my opinion, her job is quite important to society as well as to the country.\n \nThe name of this teacher is Mary Margaret and she is an English teacher in a high school located in our area. She is in fact, a much-revered teacher among her students and colleagues and I like the invaluable contribution she has for teaching in an excellent way. Besides, she is an honest person with many other excellent qualities that make her an exemplary person in our society.  \n\nTeaching, in my opinion, is a very noble profession and makes society a better place by eradicating our ignorance and by creating an enlightened generation. This profoundly important job is done by teachers who are doing a really great job for all of us. In this present era, formal educational institutes help us to enhance our knowledge and prepare us for the future. Creating an illuminated society is the main purpose of the education and teachers are helping us to acquire the wisdom and knowledge we need to lead a better life. This is why I personally think that a teacher's job is one of the most important jobs in our society.  \n\nSpeaking of Mary Margaret, I was one of her favourite students and her teaching style was quite unique. Her excellent teaching style helped me learn many grammatical rules and use English more fluently. As a teacher, she was quite devoted and punctual. She must be very proud that some of her students are in important positions nationwide and some of them still visit her."

    "Answer": "It is indeed a pleasure to talk about a person who plays an important role in society for the nature of his profession. I feel lucky as I know such a man and he is relative to me. Mr Alfred Cadman, my uncle, is such a person who contributes greatly to society.\n \nUncle Cadman is my paternal uncle, and in fact, the youngest of all the three brothers from my dad’s family. He completed his graduation in journalism a few years back and now works as a journalist. I believe his work is quite important to society. He looks smart with his adventurer-like appearance and I like his humorous and courageous characters. He is around six feet in height with a bunch of solid muscles on his body. He loves to smile and helps people in their distress, and thus he is loved by all in the locality for his benevolent nature. Besides, he often participates in different types of adventurous activities and takes part in the annual adventure festival that takes place here in the last part of December every year.\n\nBy profession, uncle Cadman is a journalist and works with a local daily. He is a senior reporter cum special correspondent for our locality on the daily newspaper. He collects news and prepares reports to be published in the daily newspaper, The Daily Life. Besides collecting events for his newspaper, he tries to bring out the real facts behind the events. Often he receives misinformation over different issues but he carefully verifies the information. He is careful about the authenticity of any information and when he seems satisfied with his thorough investigation, he submits the reports to his office to be published. As a result, he remains busy all the time around the day. Often he goes out for information even at midnight to get some stories for his newspaper.\n\nHe is very cooperative with anyone. He has access to almost everywhere in the city and by dint of his profession, he is influential. So, when someone asks for help, he extends his hands towards those people and let them get the right things for them. If any officer at any government office denies providing any service to anyone without showing the exact cause, he helps the people to get the service and often report the corruption that the government officials get involved in. Besides, he is always informed about the surroundings in the locality and if smells something unusual, he tries to solve the issues immediately to prevent detrimental or unwanted impacts of the event. By this way, he always helps others and keeps the entire locality calm and peaceful.\n\nThe profession of uncle Cadman appears something more than journalism. As he is a journalist, he has some commitments to society. His job is to collect news and events, prepare them for the reporting and send to the headquarters to be published on the next day. But if he narrates everything on the report, it may bring a catastrophe for all. So, often he sends reports in a filtered manner to keep everything under control. The information he provides to the people keeps them updated which is a must to keep pace with society. Actually, if there were no journalists, it would have been impossible to get to know about surrounding events regularly."

    "Answer": "I have borrowed many things from my friends and family members, especially, when I was a high school student. Of course, I needed to borrow those things because they were important to me. Anyway, today, I would like to talk about one such important thing, which I had to borrow about 9 years ago, and the thing I borrowed was a bicycle.\n\nWhen I was a 10th-grade student, I used to provide home tutoring in math to the lower grade students. I used to do it, not only because it offered me the opportunity to earn some extra pocket money, but also to become even better in this subject by practising it more and more. Besides, this home tutoring thing didn’t exactly cost me too much of my valuable time since all of my students and apprentice used to live close by my place and within walking distance except one, who used to live a bit too far away from me. But, that too wasn’t really much of a problem for me since I could easily take a bus and arrive at his place.\n\nThen suddenly, one day, I came to know that the bus was not going to run for the next couple of days because all the bus drivers of my town were going to observe a “strike” for a pay raise. Needless to say, I panicked a bit after learning the news since I knew that I wouldn’t be able to walk that far to give lessons to that one student of mine. And it was at that time that I decided to borrow the bicycle from my cousin, who gladly gave his bicycle to me.  \n\nAnyway, it was important for me to borrow the bicycle because the student was in the middle of some important math tests and quizzes (actually a few of them in a row), and I really needed to help him with his subject so that he could at least have an average grade. After all, he was a really poor student in math."

    "Answer": "Well, this candidate task card reminds me of several occasions when I had to borrow something useful and important from others. I would, however, go with my first instinct and talk about the event that came first in my mind. It was a recent event when I borrowed a thermometer from a neighbour. Though a thermometer is a small tool and is required only a few times, in particular, when someone suffers from fever, it is quite useful in my opinion.  \n\nIt was almost midnight and all of a sudden my younger brother, Sam, started feeling ill. He was complaining about feeling very cold and that was a symptom of getting caught by the seasonal flu. I rang one of my doctor friends and he told me not to worry too much unless Sam's body temperature was really high. He also advised me some medicines and assured me that he would visit our home in case things get worse. It was at the beginning of the last month and my younger brother suffered from fever for about 5 days. Luckily he recovered sooner than many others I know about, who were caught by the same viral flu.\n\nSpeaking of that night, after I finished talking to my doctor friend, Rick, I searched for the thermometer to check Sam's temperature. I assumed we would have at least two thermometers at our house, one in my desk and another one is in the fast-aid box that my father had. To my surprise, I could not find a single one! I searched everywhere and after 30 minutes of ceaseless searching, I quit and decided to borrow it from Paula, who was one of our closest neighbours.  \n\nI called her and she was luckily awake. I explained her Sam's condition and that I needed to borrow a thermometer from her. In 10 minutes she rushed to our house with the thermometer and talked to Same for a couple of minutes. She also brought some vitamin C enriched fruits with her and advised me to stay awake for a couple of hours to accompany Sam. She also talked with my parents and after an hour she left. She is still a caring and tender-hearted women who we consider our family friend.\n\nThe thermometer I borrowed from Paula was really needed at that time. We had to check Sam's body temperature every 30 minutes. In the next morning, I bought three thermometers and gave my father one to keep it in his fast-aid box. I returned Paula's thermometer after a couple of days and thanked her for her support and care for us."

    "Answer": "This is a nice topic for me to discuss as I have a great reputation (!) for forgetting things and I often need to borrow from my surroundings for this characteristic or nature. Last month, I had borrowed the laptop from my cousin to complete a university project.\n\nIn fact, I forgot to replace the battery of my laptop as it was having an extremely poor power backup. It is my insincerity that did not allow me to get the battery in due time and gradually the last week of the project submission appeared. Five days before the project submission, I had to borrow a laptop from my cousin. Though he delivered some angry words for my negligence, he rescued me from a negative situation I was supposed to get involved. The project was quite important as it carried more than 30% marks of the entire course.      \n\nI borrowed the laptop from my cousin, Henry. He is a freelancer and works online from home. When I was a kid, my parents asked me to follow him on his unique virtues and actually, they wanted me to shape up like Henry. He is five years older than me and looks quite smart with his curly hair and broad cheek. His eyes are dark with a bluish shade. He lives in the opposite direction of our house and my parents are fond of him for his extraordinary qualities. He has turned like an idol for me and I also try to follow some of his qualities. Unfortunately, few of my bad habits are the greatest impediments in following him.\n \nI make delay in everything and this is one of my bad habits. I have suffered a lot for the habit and still suffering in some points. I had to borrow the laptop for the same reason. In fact, I forgot to buy the laptop battery that I have been planning to buy for the past few months. Whenever I attempt to use the laptop, it makes me remember that it needs its battery. At the same time, if I do not complete the project and present the incomplete version to the class and the teachers, I might be unable to get promoted in the next semester. It was a crucial individual assignment for me. If it was teamwork, I could have crossed the barriers easily with support from my teammates.   \n\nBorrowing the laptop was a major issue for me. After completion of the project, the students were to present the ideas and other details to the audiences at the auditorium. Actually, that was not a problem as I proudly own a Dell laptop. The trouble was about its charging issues and the newly built auditorium had no external charging facilities for laptops and other electronic devices. My laptop needed continuous charging to run and whenever the charger was detached, it ran less than ten minutes. As Henry owned three laptops with high configuration, I sought his support in this case. He got angry initially when he heard that my project was quite important and I am yet to finish it. He was familiar with my nature and often advised me to change that. Finally, he extended a hand for unconditional support to me. I am truly grateful to him. By the way, I got B+ in my project and the laptop actually saved me from a disastrous situation."

    "Answer": "Exams are meant to be hard because they are set to test our “knowledge”. But, then there are some exams which are so hard that we just wish that we didn’t have to face it. Today, I would like to talk about one such exam that left me “shattered’ for many months.\n\nIt was a “math” exam which I needed to take during my school days about a few years ago in order to get admitted to one of the most prestigious high schools in my country. So, I knew what kind of an uphill battle it was going to be because so many high school students - brilliant and smart students that are - from around the country were going to fight for their places in that particular high school. Anyway, I was also mentally prepared for the exam, or at least I thought so because I spent a significant amount of time to study all kinds of high school math, that included many challenging formula and problems from algebra, geometry and trigonometry. So, when the time to take the exam finally arrived, I headed to the test centre with a very positive frame of mind.\n\nThe exam questions were handed out to me, and I immediately became busy in writing answers to the questions. However, after starting answering the questions, I found out that for some mysterious reasons, I was taking a bit longer than usual to answer most of the questions. Even more bad news was waiting for me when I found that the questions in the geometry sections were way tougher than I had initially anticipated. So, naturally, I became a bit nervous and ended up leaving most of the questions unanswered eventually.\n\nAnyway, the exam was hard for me mainly because I couldn’t manage my time properly in answering many of the questions. Besides, most of the questions in the geometry section didn’t quite match the question pattern I was hoping for. Finally, it became hard for me also because I started to panic and couldn’t quite focus to understand the questions in the geometry section."

    "Answer": "Well, this is an interesting topic to talk about. This topic reminds me of the admission test in Saint Paul college that I took in 2014. It was one of the toughest exams I have ever taken in my life. I did so bad that I was afraid to look at the result. In fact, I did not see my admission test result as I knew how poorly I had performed!\n\nIt is quite common for the colleges in our country to arrange admission tests each year to select the students they would grant admission to. I took the entrance exam in the top five colleges in our country and Saint Paul College was one of them. This college was far away from my house and due to bad traffic, I was 15 minutes late on the exam day. Being late was a disaster for me and the college authority was reluctant to let me take the exam. But later on, they decided to let me in! Half an hour was already wasted and I was feeling an immense pressure at that time. As soon as I opened the question paper, I was appalled and got stiffed as most of the questions seemed unfamiliar to me!\n\nThe college exam authority has changed their question pattern and has focused more on history and writing skill than mathematics and other science subjects! This was even a bigger blow to me. I could not answer most of the questions and wanted to get out of the exam hall as soon as possible. It was a suffocating and perplexing experience.\n\nAfter I left the college perimeter, I felt relieved and that proves that I was quite appalled and dismayed in the exam hall.\n\nAs I recall, I did not even go to see my result as I knew I would perform very poorly. Later on, I got admitted to the Prime Science College. The exam I had taken in Saint Paul College was unforgettable and one of the hardest in my life. The bad traffic, reasoning with the exam authority, unexpected question pattern and my anxiety made it even harder!"

    "Answer": "Before my admission to Columbia University in New York, I had to appear for a GRE test. I was unable to prepare properly for the test. So, it turned out to be a very difficult test for me. I would like to thank you for this topic and the time that you have allowed me to talk about it.\n\nGenerally, the GRE score is used by most of the USA universities to allow candidates to take admission. The GRE test is administered by the Educational Testing Service and the test is easy when someone has the proper preparation. But without any preparation, this is really a difficult nut to crack! Particularly, the analytical writing and critical thinking sections are troublesome for the newbies.\n\nI had to take the test last year. In fact, the classes of Columbia University began in the second week of August. So, I was in a hurry to take the test for the admission. The candidates normally prepare for the analytical, verbal and quantitative reasoning sections of the test and practice a lot. But this was not the case for me.\n\nI had to take the test as the Columbia University authority made it mandatory for each postgraduate student to take the GRE test and score at least 340 to get admitted to the university. Without having the score, the university authority would not even allow the students to submit their admission form for the postgraduate degrees.\n\nThe test turned out to be very hard for me and I realised it once I sat for the exam. I was not prepared for the test. As far as I knew, the test was for the foreign students but later I came to know that it was applicable to the native students as well. The test-takers who get a good score in this test are considered ready to take the postgraduation courses in the USA. I ended up scoring less than 250 and could not apply to Columbia University at that time."

    "Answer": "In many real-life situations, we have to depend on other people and request them to get things done, and that’s a fact. Similarly, it is also a fact of life that at times, our requests get denied, whether we consider the reasons behind rejection to be fair or not, just like my request to collect a certain “money award”, from a local city councillor, was denied about a few years ago.\n\nA few years ago, our local government authority had announced a “fund award scheme” for the selected local residents in each and every community who could prove that they had managed to grow at least one tree either in their front yard or backyard in an effort to keep the city green. Once I came to learn about the scheme, I became a bit excited because I already had a couple of grown-up trees in our big backyard, and as such, I thought that I would naturally be allowed to collect the funds from our local government authority.\n\nSo, I rushed to our local councillor’s office and filled-in an application with all the necessary information in order for me to be considered eligible for the fund. After submitting, the councillor office informed me that they would let me know about their decision in a formal letter after a couple of weeks. So, at this point, all I could do was to sit tight and wait for that letter. The letter did eventually arrive, but it informed me that I wouldn’t be eligible to collect the fund because we bought the house at a time when the trees had already “grown” there without our efforts, and they were right.\n\nAnyway, I certainly felt bad and disappointed after my request to collect the funds was denied. I also felt a bit mad at myself because I didn’t make enough efforts to learn about the eligibility criteria in more details and became “unnecessarily” optimistic. However, at the same time, I felt a bit energized and interested also in other “environment-friendly” programmes, offered by the city authority."

    "Answer": "Last year I applied for a car loan but the manager of the bank denied my application. For this cue card topic, I would like to talk about this event when my loan request was rejected by the loan section and the manager of the City Bank. I personally met the manager to know why my application was refused, and he explained to me a few facts that demonstrated why he had not granted my loan application.\n\nIt was 2018, probably during early August, when I applied for a car loan to the City Bank. As I went through their loan requirements, I believed I was eligible for the loan. I talked to the loan officer of the bank, and he asked me to fill up the loan application and to bring some necessary papers. After I submitted the signed application along with required documents addressing the manager of the branch, I had to wait for two weeks.\n\nHowever, it was quite a surprise to me that the loan department and the manager had withheld my loan application. This was a bit frustrating and unexpected to me! When I met the branch manager (his name was probably Franklin), he explained that I had to be in my current company for at least two years to be eligible for the loan. Hearing that I asked him 'why have not you mentioned that on your website and loan application form?'. I also informed that it would have saved the time and energy I have wasted for this loan application.\n\nHe was very professional and clever. He explained to me that he must maintain professional integrity and follow the bank rules in any situation. He also told me about some case scenarios where loans were not recovered since the previous branch manager did not follow the loan rules very rigidly. He also assured me that he would definitely consider my loan application if I work for more than two years with my current employer. It was, however, a denial and was a bit disappointing experience for me.\n\nAs I was denied from the bank to be granted for the loan, I used my savings and purchased a second-hand Toyota car. I have applied for two other bank loans a few years ago and none was refused. Nevertheless, I quite understand the reasons for which my loan application was not accepted and I am quite okay with that. The hard feelings that I had just after my application was refused are long gone."

    "Answer": "Attending a music concert is really exciting and I personally enjoy it a lot. But I am often unable to attend a concert if it is held at night as my father does not allow me to stay out after the evening. Last November I had to miss such an event as my father did not grant my request to attend the concert. Now I will describe the entire event to you, and thank you for this nice cue card topic.\n\nThe concert I am talking about was held at the end of last November at our college compound and some local bands were set to perform in it. It was held marking the 25th anniversary of our college. In fact, the programme was an elaborate one and started in the morning.\n\nI took part in almost all the events except for the concert. My dad is a bit conservative and does not allow me to stay out of home after the nightfall. Hence, I was unable to be there in the evening while the concert was held at night.\n\nOn that day, I asked for his permission. Usually, my parents allow me to participate in all the college functions. But when the events or programmes are at night time, they deny my requests. Accordingly, I was a bit confused about whether I would get permission or not. But with the inspiration of my group, I sought it and finally, I was denied. I made a phone call and asked for permission from my dad to stay at the college until the programme ends. But my father instructed to return home before 6.00 pm. Unfortunately, the concert was supposed to start at 7.00 pm. Moreover, the college was far away from my residence. Therefore, I was told to start for home immediately.\n\nI was really sad about the event. Actually, parents are sometimes unaware of the feelings of their children. I tried to make my dad realise that this event has been organised marking an anniversary of the college and I should be there as I am also a part of the college. But he discarded my urge on the grounds of security. He told that I would be unable to return home alone and there might be some unwanted events in concerts. In fact, he prioritised my security issue as I am his only daughter. Considering the issue, I obeyed his order. But I really missed the concert. Some of the emerging music bands were hired to perform at the programme. However, my dad surprised me with a present as I obeyed him. So, I forgot about the sadness and finally was happy with the gift. This is his way of saying sorry or thank you, I guess."

    "Answer": "I must admit that up until recently, I didn’t really care that much about making a good first impression at a job interview, probably because I am from the old school. But, then I had to change my mind because interviews these days have become so progressive in nature and intense.\n\nHowever, back in 14 plus years, I don’t really think that interviews were so much intense, perhaps because there wasn’t that much competition then. So, unlike now, people didn’t really have to worry about all the details about facing a Human Resource Manager.\n\nSo, why it is important to make a good first impression anyway? Well, the answer to this question is so ridiculously simple like a good first impression can actually get our dream job which we have been trying to get for years! Of course, when I say that a good first impression can get us our dream job, I don’t mean to say that our educational qualifications, diplomas and professional certifications, areas and the level of expertise, a specific set of skills and amount of work experiences don’t really matter. In fact, they do, but without the good first impression and preparation for the interview, it is highly unlikely that the hiring manager would even go that far. It might sound pretty strange but, then luckily, however, it doesn’t really take much of an effort to create a good first impression. So, how to make a good first impression?\n\nI should mention that I also believe making a good last impression is also vital to secure a job.\n\nWell, we should try to dress appropriately to impress our hiring manager, and the common consensus about dressing appropriately is that we don’t wear jeans, sneaker/sports shoes or t-shirts when going to a formal interview. Having a nicely-written Resume/CV handy, speaking up firmly and yet in a soft voice instead of mumbling, using standard professional terms and language and being confident and prepared to answer any kind of questions without pretending to answer some questions which we don’t have any clue about are some of the things we can do to create a very good first impression."

    "Answer": "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk to you about how to make a good first impression in a job interview. I will talk about why this is important; things someone can do to help create that perfect ‘first impression’; how to leave the interviewer with a good ‘last impression’ and finally I will wish the success for a job searcher.\n\nIn a professional situation, first impressions are extremely important. If for example, someone is attending a job interview, he needs to create a good impression as soon as he meets the interviewer. That way the employer is more likely to want to offer him the job.\n\nThere are many things a candidate can do to help create the best possible impression. For example, being on time! If someone has an appointment, it is important to arrive a few minutes early so that the meeting can start exactly on time. He should make sure he is appropriately dressed. If it is a job interview, it is a good idea to dress smartly. It will help a candidate to feel confident and will make him look more professional. He should also make sure that he is clean and well presented, he should not smell of cigarette smoke. Finally, the candidate must make sure that he does not have anything caught between his teeth! He should look in a mirror before he goes in to make sure he looks OK.\n\nThe smile helps a candidate to relax and will make him look friendly. In many cultures, it is important to make eye contact with the other person – but a candidate should not stare as it might uncomfortable for the interviewer! For a job interview, it is usual to shake hands. A candidate might want to practice doing this so it will feel natural to him. He should wait for the interviewer to ask him to sit down. When he sits down, he should try to look confident and relaxed, sit back on the chair and thank the interviewers for inviting him in to talk to them. He must not slouch and look too relaxed, but also he should not perch on the front of the seat either – this way, the candidate will look uncomfortable and it will make his interviewers feel uncomfortable too!\n\nA candidate will also create a good impression at an interview if he has prepared thoroughly for the meeting. He must ensure that he has researched the job and the company. He must be clear about what he can offer them and why he would be good at the job.\n\nWhen he answers questions, he should try to be positive and enthusiastic as well as friendly. He needs to show his personality as well as his skills. At the end of the interview, he needs to think about the last impression he makes on the employer. That way, they will remember the candidate more positively. The candidate should thank the person for seeing him, then stand up, shake hands again and smile as he leaves the room. The candidate wants the interviewer to think as he leaves- ‘what a lovely candidate, I would like him to come and work with me!’\n\nI hope if a candidate follows this advice it will help him to form a good impression at interviews when he meets people for the first time in a formal environment."

    "Answer": "A job interview is an event or arrangement when the employer tries to judge the overall competency of an applicant for the post. Hence, this is an important issue to consider. Now, I will describe the importance and few preparation tips for the first impression which are beneficial for a job interview.\n\nIt is quite natural that the employer will try to critically examine how competent the applicant is for the post. So, if an applicant cannot prove his worth at the interview board, the job will be offered to someone more proficient with the requirements of the authority. Undoubtedly, everyone should agree on the fact that the first impression is the most important thing and the memory of the first meeting lasts for longer with the people.\n\nIf you make a good first impression, in the beginning, it is better to continue till the last. In fact, when you start behaving politely in the opening, the audience or the employer authority will expect you to be the same until the last moment. If you even slightly deviate from the position, they will notice the fact and that may help them taking any negative decision on you. Certainly, the situations in an interview board will change and all the situations might not be in your favour or under your control. The interviewers will try to test the applicants in different ways and analyse the reactions. In fact, this is a strategy to assess an applicant. So, if you do not continue the first impression, there are chances that you will miss the job.\n\nI would follow some simple but effective techniques to prove myself as a competent candidate. Professionalism is the key issue here. Almost all employers want their employees to be professional in all possible terms. Aside from this feature, they also want their employees to be well-groomed, clean and tidy.\n\nMaking a good first impression is really a hard task and everyone cannot do it effectively. There are some basic principles for this task. First of all, as a job candidate, you have to learn about the company. Then you should know your job. When you will apply for a post, the interviewers will ask you about the company and the jobs you are supposed to execute. In such situations, it is really difficult to answer if you do not have the right data. Thereby, collecting important data about the job and company helps create a positive impression on the authority. Wearing formal dresses is the other important thing to do. You cannot move casually for a job interview and it will prove your insincerity. Besides, you should also be present at the interview venue before the scheduled hour. Talking politely and listening more will help you to a great extent. Moreover, keep your answers short as much possible and to the point. If anyone can perform all the activities and have the luck with him, there are chances to create a good first impression at the job interview."

But, I never thought that I would miss a train one day in spite of being a punctual person for the most part. Let me tell you what exactly happened on that day.\n\nIt was about a couple of years ago, one day, when it was raining really hard, and I needed to go out of the town to attend the wedding ceremony of one of my best friends. The plan was to take an “express train” and reach my friend as early as possible. I even purchased the train ticket well in advance because waiting till the last hour would put me to the risk of not getting the ticket at all.\n\nAnyway, everything went according to my plan and schedule, but the non-stop rain, with occasional torrential storms, made it really difficult for me to catch a taxi in time. But, on the other hand, I was becoming a bit mad (at myself, perhaps) and nervous because the departure schedule for my train was approaching fast, and I just couldn’t do anything about it except waiting for the rain to stop. Anyway, eventually, the rain relented a little, and I finally got a taxi to arrive at the station. But, by the time I reached the train station after manoeuvring an ocean of traffic, which built up due to the bad weather and road condition, I was already too late.   \n\nAnyway, after missing the train, I became a bit frustrated and immediately tried to get some information on the next train schedule and its itinerary, due to be heading in the same direction. But, unfortunately, it wouldn’t help me reach my destination in time. Next, I tried to catch a bus, but that too wasn’t much of a help because it wouldn’t hit the road unless the weather improved further. Finally, I called my friend and left the station, feeling a bit dejected, after explaining the situation to him."

However, despite my travel on an aeroplane a few times, I have never missed my flight. For this cue card topic, I would like to talk about my experience when I missed my train from (...tell a train station name...) to (...another train station name...).\n\nIt was 2014 and I was around 21 years old at that time. We were invited to one of my cousins' wedding ceremony and my father asked me to attend that wedding party. My parents could not arrange leaves from their office and I did not have any class at that time. The wedding ceremony was arranged at my uncle's house in (...a city name...) which was almost 600 kilometres away from our residence.\n\nI booked my train ticket online and paid for it using my credit card. My train was supposed to leave at 9.00 am and I reached the train station at around 8.30 am. My father dropped me off and I had a suitcase and a small bag with me. To my dismay, the train did not arrive on time and my father had to leave me due to his office. I got frustrated at 11.30 am as the train was yet to come! I contacted the train master several times and he could not give any definitive answer. Whenever I saw a train at the station, I ran into it only to find that it was not my train. This was probably the most disappointing experience until then.\n\nI called my mother at around 1.00 pm and she was very anxious about me. I heard from an officer at the train station that there was a minor accident and that is the reason our train was delayed. I was hungry already and took my baggage with me and went to a nearby restaurant to have my lunch. After that, I went to a shopping mall to purchase some items to kill some time. My \"fate\" must have been against me! When I returned to the train station, I heard that my train arrived 20 minutes ago and had already left! I felt like I was hit by a thunderbolt. I hardly spent 40 minutes to finish my lunch and shopping and during this time, I missed my train!\n\nI immediately contacted the trainmaster and he advised me to take another train that will leave at 3.00 pm. As I heard that it would not directly go to the (...destination train station's name...), I discarded this advice. I went home and took a bus the next day. There was no hiccup on my bus journey but the previous day's event, when I missed my train, became an unusual event as this was the first time I missed a train. Afterwards, I have never left the bus or train station while waiting for a train or bus to arrive."

    "Answer": "I love to travel and in fact, this is a hobby I enjoy. But I have experienced a troublesome event to pursue it and now I am going to describe one such event that occurred during the last summer. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about it.\n\nI am an IT professional and have to remain busy in my office. So, to get relieved from boredom or fatigue, I often travel to different cities and countries during my vacations. Accordingly, I planned a trip to France from the USA last summer. Almost all of the airliners were pre-booked on the day. I managed to get an air ticket at the last moment. Unfortunately, I missed the aeroplane and it was entirely my fault. I did not check the time properly. It was set to fly at 7 a.m. while I went to the airport at 7 p.m. - with a gap of 12 hours, I missed the flight.\n\nFrance is a land of culture. A large number of people come here to enjoy this cultural beauty. Furthermore, I love French food. In 2014, I  visited the country with my family and loved it, especially our time in \"Paris\". So, I planned to go there again to pass some memorable days. I also wanted to visit the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre museum, the French Rivera, Sainte-Chapelle, Palace of Versailles, the Musée d'Orsay and other tourist spots. But I was very unfortunate to miss my flight.\n\nI missed the flight because I did not look at the flight schedule properly. On the scheduled date, I took a taxi and reached the airport. But when I heard that the flight was in the morning, I felt sad for my negligence. The aeroplane left in the morning and I was there in the evening to get on board. What an irony that was!\n\nThe airliner authority had nothing to do about it. So, I admitted my fault and left the airport with dismay. I had a whole week before me to spend with nothing to do. Thereby, I made other plans to pass the vacation. I bought some books that I wanted to read. Besides, I watching movies was another recreational activity for me during this vacation."

    "Answer": "In an ideal world, nobody should really be strangers to us because we all share pretty much the same goals, feelings, sadness and happiness in our life. But, unfortunately, we don’t live in an ideal world where our limitation as humans and fear of the unknown force us to be sceptical about trusting a stranger. Needless to say, I am not immune from this scepticism either.\n\nBut, I still needed to trust a stranger about 5 years ago when my father had to go through a critical by-pass heart surgery. By the way, my father was already a 70 years old person back then, and he had suffered from a massive heart attack a few days earlier. Luckily, we were in the hand of a very expert heart surgeon, who assured us that his team would have no problem in having a successful operation on my father by the grace of almighty. Having said that, however, he also warned us at the same time that my father was also in risk of losing too much blood at the time of surgery since he was a rather old man. Anyway, the doctor also gave us an idea as to how many bags of blood would be required to keep my father in a stable condition.\n\nSo, we started to talk to all of my family members and relatives, but unfortunately, we were still short of one blood bag. So, we decided to contact some professional blood donors even though we heard a lot of negative comments about them earlier. But, since, we had no other options because my father had a rather rare blood group, we decided to accept his blood after running some regular tests on his health condition.\n\nLuckily, the blood transfusion into the body of my father, who had just gone through some serious surgery, was successful without any reaction or complication. I and my entire family thanked the blood donor from the bottom of our hearts. In response, he simply said that he was happy to have been able to help."

    "Answer": "Interesting topic indeed and thank you for allowing me to talk about an event when I trusted a stranger! We sometimes have to trust people we do not know. The outcome of this faith and trust varies and trusting a complete stranger is not always a bad idea. However, our intuition and experience tell us not to rely on a complete outsider. Despite this, I believed people on different occasions and many times they were completely unknown to me.\n\nOne day, I was on my way to my hometown and our bus got delayed. To add more misery, on the route, the bus suddenly stopped working in a desolate area. The driver told us that the brake of the bus was not working and he had to stop the car to avoid any risk. Some of the passengers took alternative buses but the rest of us were stuck there. At least 4-5 hours were needed to repair the bus and waiting that long was not a good idea especially in this strange place.\n\nAll of a sudden a stranger approached us and told me that we should hire a private car and reach our destination. I noticed that he had already managed three other passengers who had accepted his proposition. However, when this person told me that the nearest car hire service was two miles away and we would need to give him $30 per person so that he can pay the money to the company and bring the car, my gut feeling told me not to trust him. I asked him to call the car rental company to pick us, and he replied that he had already done so and the car rental company would not send the car this far without the advance payment. The stranger I am talking about was around 35 years old and as I recall his name was Stephen.\n\nAs per a conversation I had with him, he was a banker. I trusted this stranger, gave him 30 dollars and waited dubiously for an hour for him to return. At a time during my waiting, I thought he would not show up at all. Nevertheless, after approximately 2 hours, he came back with a hired car and a driver. It was a great relief to me. I laughed silently for distrusting this person initially. However, it turned out that trusting him was a good idea.\n\nI reached home just before the darkness settled in and thanked this stranger, whose name was Stephen, for his initiative to hire a car and reach home before the night. His plan, stamina, leadership quality and timely decision saved us from the possible danger of being stuck in an unknown place. When the car dropped me near my home, the stranger had already dropped off the car. Nonetheless, I thanked him again, this time silently without him noticing my gratitude for his timely decision and action."

    "Answer": "Recently my journey to Australia from Vietnam was a bit difficult. During that time, I had to rely on a stranger. I would like to talk about this event when I trusted this unknown person.\n\nI am a journalist and my office had recently sent me to Vietnam to cover some news articles. So, after completing the tasks in Vietnam, I had to return to Australia. On the way back home, I met this person. When I entered the Ho Chi Minh City Airport, I needed help, and the man lent a helping hand to me. In fact, without his support, it was almost impossible for me to get rid of the customs and immigration troubles.\n\nThe man, Jacob Abraham was an Australian as well. He was a scriptwriter (that I came to know later) for television commercials. He also travelled in Vietnam and was returning on the same day as I was. He is on the view that if someone is in trouble, it is our moral responsibility to help this person - this is what he told me when I thanked him for his support.\n\nI guess I trusted him because he appeared to be a complete gentleman to me. Some people, if not all, can give an impression that you can rely on them and he was one such person, I guess. I was having trouble explaining to one of the customs officers that my stay was extended by the immigration authority but he was not convinced. I had a few bags and luggage and it was tough for me to carry them all with me as I needed to visit different rooms in the immigration section. Jacob Abraham, the person I am talking about came to my rescue. I requested him to look after my baggage and he did so for about an hour -a great help for me considering the situation.\n\nActually, I had no options left rather than relying on him. It was not possible for me to carry the heavy suitcases and bags with me to clear the bureaucratic issues related to immigration. I think he did a great job for me. If it was not for me him, I had to leave the luggage unattended! I profoundly thanked him for his selfless help. We departed at a time but he made my day and I would always remember his support."

    "Answer": "If anybody were to ask me to name the “eighth” wonder of the world, I certainly would have said the invention of the internet. In fact, it is almost impossible to imagine a world without the internet because it allows us to do so many things, from buying the most favourite gift for my nephew’s birthday to selling my antique and ancient watch, and from posting a unique story to making friends online.\n\nTalking about making online friends, I actually have been lucky to meet a few of them, but “Rachel” seems to be the special one among them, whom I met for the first time about 5 years ago on an English language learning forum. To introduce Rachel, she lives in Canada, and she is an ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher. Before 5 years, she also happened to be a regular contributor on an English language learning forum online where I also used to take part on a regular basis in order to learn English quickly and easily. And, luckily, Rachel also used to take all the pain to answer my questions in a very fluent but kind manner. In fact, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to suggest that it is because of Rachel’s efforts and kindness that I have become a bit more proficient in using English Language today.\n\nAnyway, today, I am not only a good fan of Rachel because of her great linguistic abilities, even though she doesn’t show up on that language forum that regularly, but also a good online friend. In fact, as a good online friend, I email to her almost regularly about my life, profession and family, as well as about the other fun things that go on with my life. I also post regular travel update on her messenger services since she likes to learn about the beautiful places of my country. Finally, we also exchange different kinds of online gift cards on different occasions and festivals of our countries. All in all, I am so glad and grateful that I found a great online friend like Rachel."

    "Answer": "To be honest, I have many online friends and selecting someone to talk about for this cue card topic was a bit tough for me. Many of my online friends stay far away and I have never met a few of them. This candidate task card reminds me of Julia, who is a good online friend of mine. She lives in Sweden and I have never met her.\n\nJulia is around  27 years old and a British citizen. She is doing her post-graduation at a Swedish university. She became my friend on LinkedIn, which is a networking website for professionals. After that, we became Facebook and Twitter friends.\n\nIt would be more than 4 years ago when we first time got connected online and learned about each other on LinkedIn. However, I would say, we became friends a year later. Thus we are online friendship for over three years.\n\nWe often email each other, exchange greeting cards & gifts and update our life events. Since we both have a similar educational background and many common interests, we have many interesting and exciting topics to discuss. We often chat online and both of us follow each other on Facebook. With time, we have become reliable friends. I frequently get lengthy emails from her which describe everything she is up to. Last month I sent her a gift that she liked very much.\n\nI think common interests, similar mindset and regular communication keep our friendship alive. Even though we have never met each other, our friendship means a lot to both of us. Digital friendship often lacks the commitment, feelings and reciprocal respects that most of the real-life friends have, but I never feel it in my friendship with Julia.  She means as much any of my friends means to me. I am not sure how this online friendship would go on in the future but at present, Julia is a good friend of mine who cares for me and value our friendship."

    "Answer": "The human being cannot live alone - it's imprinted in their genetic code and they are born to socialise and have friends. But with the passage of time, the socialisation process has turned virtual to a certain extent and people are utilising different online applications and platforms to maintain their relationships. Hence, the number of online friends we have is on the rise and I am really happy to talk about one of my online friends to you.\n\nI have a good number of online friends all over the world and among them, I communicate with Alexander Kir more often than others. He is a teacher and lives in Saint Petersburg in Russia with his family. His profile picture on Facebook depicts that he is getting ready for skiing with his daughter. He is really a good friend of mine and we often chat with each other. I know all of his family members through the pictures he shared on his Facebook timeline. I have been maintaining our online friendship for the past two years.\n\nI am an architect in Vietnam. While browsing Facebook, one day I got a friend request from an unknown individual named Alexander Kir. I usually do not accept any unknown requests on Facebook. However, I later found that he was a student at the University of Edinburgh where I completed my graduation and post-graduation degrees. Since he was from the same university, I accepted his friend request.  \n\nThe friendship between us began in mid of 2016. But now we are good buddies. We regularly chat with each other and sometimes have video calls. Last Christmas, he made a video call where all of my family had a virtual get together with his family. In fact, distance is not a big issue with the prolific power of technology these days.\n\nMaintaining a virtual friendship is not always easy. In the real-life scenario, we meet each other to maintain and grow our friendship. But in virtual situations, it is not possible. But I think our friendship is going on because we have a mutual understanding between us. Alexander and I value our friendship and respect each other's opinion. This helps us maintain our online friendship even though we do not meet each other in person."

    "Answer": "Nobody really likes to wait in a long queue or line. But, that’s just a wishful thinking in a very densely populated country, where people need to get in the line even to buy some eggs on discounts because there are just too many customers to buy them without creating any chaos. Anyway, like many others in my country, I also needed to wait in a long - I mean, really long - queue once about 4/5 years ago.\n\nOf course, I was not trying to buy any eggs on discounts back then, but rather I was only trying to get my national ID from my local government authority. By the way, about 4/5 years ago, the government of my country had announced a programme to give a national ID card to all of its adult citizens within a certain period of time. And, if anybody had failed to obtain his or her ID card within that stipulated period of time, he or she would have to go through a lot of unnecessary hassles of providing extra documents to the legal authority for the purpose of citizenship verification.  \n\nBut, anyway, since I didn’t want to go through all that bureaucratic hassles, I decided to get my ID within the regular scheduled date, but little did I know that I would need to wait in the queue of as many as 200 people that stretched over at least quarter of a mile. First, I thought, it was going to be a quick process, because I assumed that they had an efficient system in place, but I was proved out to be wrong because the process was taking way too longer than what I had initially anticipated.  \n\nAnyway, after waiting for almost an hour and a half, I finally did get my ID, but the agony of that long waiting period hunted me for a long time. In fact, my legs started to pain because of standing for a long period of time, and I was calling the officials with all sorts of “bad names” because of their sheer incompetence and negligence, which was silly of me, I guess!"

    "Answer": "I think this is an easy topic for me and I be able to speak about one such recent event when I had to wait more than an hour in a very long queue. Thank you for this nice cue card topic.\n\nIt would not be more than 3-4 months ago and it was just before the Christmas and New Year time. On a Sunday evening, I went to a supermall near my home to do some necessary shopping. I spent almost 45 minutes to pick up all the essential items and the number of items I purchased was more than usual! Then I approached the checkout point of the mall. While shopping, I noticed that many people were buying items for the Christmas and New Year celebration. Due to this, the crowd seemed a bit larger than usual. However, as soon as I reached the checkout point, I was bewildered. I had no idea how large the queue in this shopping mall could be!\n\nThere were more than 5 checkout points but each of those was surprisingly crowded. I could not decide which queue to stand in! Strangely, people behind me were forcing me to go ahead and I had no other alternatives but to stand in the nearest queue. I actually counted the number of people who were also waiting in my queue ahead of me. It was probably 21 or 22 and I got quite anxious to leave the shopping mall as soon as possible. The cash registers and the salespersons were very busy and most of the customers' shopping carts were full.\n\nAt a point of my waiting in this long queue, I thought to put back my items on the shelves and leave the shopping mall. However, I discarded the idea as those items were important for me and my family. Many items were for the Christmas and the New Year celebration and I could not leave without buying these items. Moreover, I thought moth other shopping centres would also be packed at this time of the year. After 30 minutes or so, I started playing games on my mobile phone. I did so for about half an hour and then I noticed that the line in front of me had become smaller. On the other hand, the number of people behind me had grown to more than 50! Most of the people were shopping for the two major approaching festivals and all of them were waiting in the queue peacefully. The air was filled with the aroma of the festivity and people looked happy and cheerful even though they had to wait in a very long queue for a long time. This thought calmed me and after approximately 25 minutes I paid my bill and the salesgirl wished me merry Christmas. I greeted her back and she apologised for the long queue. I told her that I understand and it was not a problem for me. However, I knew how irritating and tough it was to wait for such a long time in a large queue. As soon as I got back to my car and started the engine, I felt much better and I was happy to finally have my shopping done!"

    "Answer": "Thank you, sir/madam, for this nice cue card topic. New Year is ahead and marking the celebration, a wide number of preparations are underway. I want to meet my parents who live in Belgium and thus went to buy a train ticket for me at Frankfurt Central Station three days ago. There I had to wait in a really large queue.\n\nIt was a bright and sunny day and I started from the dormitory I live in. I reached the station within 25 minutes but I was surprised at the long queue that exceeded the train station building. It was unusual. In fact, everyone was in a rush and went there to book their tickets in advance for the New Year travel.\n\nThe queue began from the ticket counter and was getting longer every minute. Luckily I could manage a space to stand in the middle of the queue. Later I came to know that the ticket-selling stopped for a network-related problem and even before the personnel at the station started offering the tickets, peoples started to form the queue. Amid a huge rush, people wanted to secure their seats and berths on the train. Journey by train in Germany is quite comfortable and many Germans love to travel by train.\n\nEveryone wanted to buy tickets, so they went to the train station as early as possible to get it without any trouble. But during this time of the year, the queue gets longer and longer. I had to wait longer than usual as the computer network had a glitch.\n\nWaiting in a long queue of people is not always pleasant. I have heard of such long queues but never experienced before that day. So, it was a new experience for me. Thereby, I did not enjoy standing. Moreover, I felt a cramp in my leg due to standing for so long. I had to wait for over two hours in the queue. Finally, we all got our tickets once the network was restored and I was happy about that. Hopefully, I will visit my parents next week."

    "Answer": "To be honest, I can hardly recall a time when I had a problem with sleeping. But, of course, I also have bad days (or should I say “bad nights”) once in a blue moon, when even a person like me has to struggle to fall asleep. Today, I would like to share the story of one such bad night when I couldn’t sleep at all.\n\nIt happened about 5/6 years ago when I needed to visit a small town in my country in a very remote area to meet a prospective client. The call to visit that client came rather unexpectedly. But, since, the client was willing to offer a lucrative deal to my real estate company, I, as a Sr. Sales Director, had no other option but to leave for the little town the very next day to close the deal.\n\nBy the way, my company was in the business of constructing markets, manufacturing plants and commercial centres. But, after arriving in that small town at night, I found that there were only a couple of small hotels in that town with no vacancy. But, a manager from one of those hotels offered me a room which was very close to the reception and lobby area.\n\nInitially, I became glad about the offer, thinking that I had finally found a place to sleep, only, of course, to find out later at night that there was nothing to be glad, after all. In fact, I couldn’t sleep the whole night because the night auditor (in charge of the night shift) of the hotel kept his TV on the whole night with high volume. Besides, he was also talking with his friends in a very loud voice over the phone the whole night that prevented me from sleeping.\n\nAnyway, after spending the night there, I felt that I should have been more careful in choosing a hotel in that small town. Besides, I also felt too tired and cranky to talk to my client that day since I couldn’t sleep the whole night. All in all, it was a horrible experience."

    "Answer": "I often go to bed after midnight and a sleepless night is not a rare experience for me. Remaining awake to prepare for an approaching exam is the most common reason I spent many sleepless nights. However, for this cue card topic, I would like to talk about a night I spent at a hospital and could not sleep even for a minute.\n\nIt was 2016, probably the mid-July, and all of a sudden my grandfather got severely ill. The doctor who came to our house to check my grandfather advised us to take him to the city hospital. We called for an ambulance and took my grandpa to the hospital. My parents, two cousins, my eldest uncle and my youngest aunt were in the hospital that night. They were all very worried and my aunt was sobbing ceaselessly. We were all concerned about the well-being of my grandpa. The doctor told us that it was wise of us to bring the patient to the hospital without any delay as it could have been disastrous otherwise. He also informed us that a panel of doctors who were observing my grandpa's medical history had decided to operate him that night. He also assured us that it was a minor operation and we had nothing to worry about as the best doctor in the town happened to be there that night. In spite of the doctor's assurance, we were very anxious.\n\nAt around 11.00 pm the doctor operated my grandpa and he was unconscious. I stayed at the hospital until the next noon and could not sleep at all.\n\nFrankly speaking, I did not want to sleep at all and the experience did not bother me. A hospital is not a place where a patient's relatives and family members can sleep. I prayed to the Almighty to help my grandpa get well soon. At around 4.30 in the morning, a nurse came to us and gave us the good news; my grandpa was conscious at that time and he wanted to see us. That was a great relief and we thanked the nurse who gave us this news.\n\nIt was a sleepless night but I did not feel dizzy or sleepy at all. My brain must have been busy thinking about the sickness and wellbeing of my grandfather and the expresso coffee also released some of my tiredness. I slept the next day at around 3.30 pm and my grandfather was out of the danger then. Interestingly I slept almost 14 consecutive hours the next day as I can recall."

    "Answer": "Waking up all of a sudden at night or sleeping only for a couple of hours is really irritating experience. But in some cases, people are to pass sleepless nights due to some unavoidable reasons. Last month, I had to pass a sleepless night too because of an important exam the next day. I would like to thank you for the chance to talk about it.\n\nI am an undergrad student at Hopkinson's University and my major is History. A couple of months ago I took my third-semester final examination and it was an important exam. Moreover, a course titled 'Ancient history and its impact on the modern era' was a bit difficult for me. In fact, it was one of the toughest courses in the entire semester. I was not prepared well for the subject. Accordingly, I felt the necessity to revise the syllabus the night before the exam.\n\nI live in the university dormitory and my other roommates are from my class. Hence, the situation was the same for all of us as we had the same exam the next day. But it was worse for me! Fortunately, my roommates helped me greatly that night by sharing their class notes and idea. If I had been in any other place other than my dormitory, it would have been impossible for me to properly prepare for the course. I did not sleep at all that night and it was not a big issue as I had two other roommates who were also sleepless.\n\nMy preparation for the exam was not sufficient and that is why I had to take the challenge to utilise the remaining night and prepare for the exam. It is often a trend that many students follow. Though I am not one of them, this time it was different. I spent the night mostly by revising the syllabus and drinking coffee.  \n\nIt was an arduous task for me to complete the syllabus in one night. There were lots of texts and most of them dealt with complex ancient historical events. However, my roommates helped me to a great extent. With their support and with the cost of a sleepless night, I took the exam. The grading is yet to be published but I am hoping for a good grade.\n\nThis sleepless night was a lesson for me. I had to spend the sleepless night only for my negligence. If I were sincere enough with the course, I could have done better in the test."

But, my story about is about a time when my mistake angered the others.\n\nWell, it actually happened about 10 years ago when I had just finished high school and about to attend college. And the persons, who got angry with me, were none other than my own parents.\n\nAfter finishing my school, one day my parents told me that they were going to visit my ill aunt (elder sister of my father) at another town which was about 300 kilometres away from our hometown. They also told me that it would at least a few days before they come back from my aunt’s town. But, as my parents were away, I took it an opportunity to call some of my friends at my home and do some party. And, it was a grand party in one evening since we all used my mother’s kitchen to cook all kinds of foods. The party also included some marathon dancing activities of my friends as the loud music was also on during that evening.\n\nAnyway, everything went well with the party except one thing, and that was we burnt my mother’s lovely oven in the process of trying a bake a cake. To tell the truth, we never really prepared ourselves for such an unfortunate accident. But, prepared or not, the accident happened because of my negligence and carelessness, and I had to pay the price for it. Luckily, however, it wasn’t such a stiff price as my parents kept it to just throwing some angry words on my way.\n\nAnyway, I felt really guilty and ashamed of my activities in the absence of my parents as I thought that I should have informed my parents about the party in advance. Besides, I also felt that I deserved the angry words from my parents as the situation could have easily gone out of my control as far as the accident was concerned."

    "Answer": "No matter how hard we try, we cannot control our anger all the time. Sometimes we lose control and get quite angry with someone. This is a part of our human characteristics. When some people are short-tempered and get angry easily, many others are very placid and super cool. My father is one of the coolest and understanding persons I have ever known. This cue card topic reminds me of the day when he became very angry with me. Thank you for this cue card topic and the chance to share this experience with you.\n\nIt would be either 2010 or 2011 and I was around 16 years old at that time. I used to play football every evening and was a mid-fielder in our high school football team. My parents were worried about me as they thought I was too much involvement in sports. To some extent it was true and they were concerned that it would demote my academic performance. Their doubt was proven true and I performed very poorly in my year final exam.\n\nAfter my father looked at my scorecard, he frowned at me and asked me the reason for this poor performance in the exam. I mumbled for a few seconds and could not give him any definitive and satisfactory answer. Next day he went to my school and found out that I skipped a few classes only to practice football in the nearby playground. My teacher also complained that I was supposed to bring my parents to meet him for a discussion but they never went to my school to meet him! That possibly ignited the rage in my father as I actually never told him that one of my teachers wanted to meet them. After he returned home, he got furious. I do not blame him for the anger he showed. I would probably have reacted the same way if I had been him!\n\nI had never seen him become so infuriated until that very day. He was literally screaming and out of control. He was acting like a wounded wild animal who had been deceived and hurt. I thought it would be the best policy to remain silent and answer honestly everything he asks until he calms down. Though I felt very afraid, I knew my father. He is a great dad and his anger was understandable. I knew that he was a decent and cool person and I should be honest with him to avoid any further damage. I also felt sad for me and for my parents and was promising myself not to repeat that heinous act ever again. I was sorry for my imprudent and immature lifestyle. I also promised myself that I would never disappoint my parents and would never bring any disgrace to my family.\n\nGiven the time, my father got calm within 40 minutes or so. He remained silent for the whole day and the next day he had a candid discussion with me. I love my parents very much and my love and respect for them made me realise how important it was for me to study harder and become one of the top scorers in the class."

A few weeks ago, I was supposed to submit an assignment to my biology teacher- Mr Leo Falkner. Unfortunately, I failed to bring that (in fact, I lost the assignment) and it caused a disaster!\n\nMr Leo Falkner takes our biology class. He is a very sincere teacher and we love to be in his classes. 'He is a perfectionist'- as referred by many in our college. Besides, he is a man of letters and knows well how to maintain his schedules. Regarding punishment, he is often flexible, but if someone fails to submit an assignment in due time, he is not stretchy at all and I have learned it is a hard way! Usually, Mr Falkner does not get angry with anyone but he was infuriated with me as I could not submit an assignment before the due date.\n\nHe has a reputation as a strict teacher and he does not like any incompatibility regarding the matters of academic activities. But he is considerate enough for reasonable excuses on other issues. But in my case, the matter was a bit complex and different than usual. I lost my assignment from my dormitory! I completed the assignment the day before but it was missing since the morning. I notified that to Mr Falkner but he did not believe me and got angry. He thought I made things up as an excuse which he was not ready to accept. I understand his point of view and could not argue with him. He lost his temper and started shouting at me. In fact, I have never seen him so angry before.\n\nI was shocked and totally confused. At a time my face turned pale and my eyes became wet. I guess when he regained his temper, he understood that I was not a liar! Considering the situation, he allowed me two more days to submit the assignment. I was relieved. In fact, without the assignment submission, my grade could have fallen substantially. Besides, it was a great lesson for me as I was not careful enough to keep an important document in a safe place. I am more careful now than ever before about my assignments and their safekeeping!"

    "Answer": "I have already read a number of books before, and needless to say, I have found most of them to be as eye-openers and stimulating. In fact, I wholeheartedly believe that there is no better friend of a man than books. So, I read them whenever I get a chance just like I am planning to read a book called “Nineteen Eighty-Four” in the next few months, hopefully.\n\nThis great dystopian fiction (some would also call it science fiction), often published as \"1984\", is written by famous English novelist, essayist, journalist and critic called George Orwell. Later on, of course, as I learned a great about the life of this prolific and philanthropist writer, it became abundantly clear to me that he was no ordinary writer.\n\nIf I haven’t heard it wrong, this book was published on 8 June of 1949 as Orwell’s final book in his lifetime. Anyway, I learned about this book from one of my university friends who was using some references from this great dystopia literature in order to prepare his thesis paper on the comparison of the British political system before the Second World War and after the Second World War. He also told me how fascinating he really found the book as he was trying to note down the references. So, since, I also take a great deal of interest in different political systems of the world and their impacts on the \"international relationship\" and \"conflicts\", I decided that I would certainly read this book in near future.\n\nAnyway, I want to read this book, primarily because I really want to be able to understand how possibly a writer could envision the totalitarian political system of the future world in such an impeccable manner. Besides, I also want to be able to learn and understand if the writer found any clue back then about the future political system of the world from the architects of the First World War and the Second World War, as well as the Spanish Civil war in which he actively took part."

    "Answer": "Thank you a lot for this nice cue card topic. I have a list of books that I want to read and one of the famous books on this list is 'Moby Dick' or 'The Whale'. This novel was written by an American writer 'Herman Melville'. As far as I can recall, this book was first published in 1851 by 'Harper & Brothers' publication.\n\nWithout any doubt, 'Moby Dick' is one of the most acclaimed and popular novels of all time. This is basically an epic adventure fiction that has made its place in several lists of 'The best books ever'. Herman Melville, the writer, created a fine classic that will be read beyond centuries.\n\nI have heard about this book from different sources. In my school, one of the teachers recommended this book and this is the first time I heard about the book 'Moby Dick'. During my college days, one of my friends, who was a bookworm, also narrated the story of this book and told me that I should read it. After I opened an account on 'Goodreads', which is a social networking website for the book lovers, I read different citations and reviews of this book. Another time a daily newspaper published a feature article on this book and I learned more details about this book.\n\nI am very fond of reading and I love to read novels, fictions, classics, biographies and history-related books. I always wanted to read Moby Dick and hopefully, I will finish reading it soon. I have a digital copy of this book in my Kindle Voyage eBook reader, but I want to read the paperback version. This is probably the only reason I am yet to read the book.\n\n As far as I know, this book was first published during the period of the American Renaissance and is considered as the finest American Literary work. The opening line 'Call me Ismael\" is among the world literature's greatest opening line in a novel. A great British novelist and poet once claimed this book 'one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world and the greatest book of the sea ever written\".\n\nThis is a widely recommended book around the world and I would like to read it to be able to enjoy the finest piece of literary work and to complete one of my 'must-read' lists."

    "Answer": "Reading is an excellent habit and I am proud to have it from my childhood. I have read a notable number of local and international novels but have not tasted the 'War and Peace' yet. So, I would like to read this great novel as soon as I can.\n\nRussian author Leo Tolstoy is famous mostly for the novel 'War and Peace'. The novel is one of the best literary works in the history of world literature and a major work by Tolstoy. This is a novel that comes with the history of invasion - when France invaded Russia. At the same time, it focused on the elements of Tsarist society and how that was influenced by the Napoleonic era. The members of five Russian blue-blood families came to life in this book. It was first published in 1869.\n\nCount Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, better known as Leo Tolstoy to his readers and to the world was born in 1828. He was born in Russia while the family he born to was a noble family at that time. His literary life began in his early twenties and some of his creations are influenced by his real-life experiences. He has completed a wide number of short stories, fictions, plays, essays and novellas.\n\nI am a book lover and seek books wherever I go. As part of my visit to my uncle, Vladimir Jacob, at his farmhouse in Kazan, I found the book. In fact, he is a widely-read man who collects books and has formed a huge library. The library contains more than 5000 books in different languages. While I was browsing for a book to pass my days there, I found 'War and Peace'. Earlier, I have heard about the book but never had the chance to read it. So, I decided to read this classic literary piece at that time. When I took the novel to my uncle, he offered me a short description of the book and told me about its author. He highly praised the novel and said that it was a journey to the history of Russia. Before writing it, Tolstoy did extensive research and accordingly, depicted the era that he had never seen while the work has become a masterpiece in the history of world literature. Subsequently, I decided that I would like to read the novel. Unfortunately, my visit was cut short and I had to return my hometown without reading the book. So, naturally, I would like to finish it soon."

    "Answer": "The truth is I have always loved to live alone since the day I started my university life. And I continued living alone when I started to work as well. But, then, one day, after living alone for quite some times, one of my distant cousins requested me to share my flat with him as he was moving in the same town, where I lived, to attend a university. So, after giving some thoughts to his request I finally decided to help him out.\n\nAs I just mentioned that he was a university student, so I assumed that he was going to live with me for quite some time, could be as long as 4/5 years, until he finished his university studies. So, I told him to make himself at home while helping him to buy the necessary furniture. Of course, the good thing is that he didn’t really have to buy many things as I already had most of them that a university student would need. For example, I already had a study table and a chair. Besides, I also had sofa chairs at my flat. So, all he needed at that time was a bed. So, anyway, we started our new life as two roommates except, of course, my younger cousin would hardly get any time to socialize with me.\n\nIn fact, he would enter his room just, when I was about to go to bed, as he had to remain busy for a very significant part of the day in attending his classes and doing his part-time job. Suddenly, one day, after living with me for about a year, my cousin told me that he was going to live with one of his best university friends. And, so he was gone.  \n\nAnyway, living with a roommate was a completely new experience for me, but it wasn’t really bad. Besides, I felt glad that I could actually help my young cousin when he needed it the most. Finally, we also enjoyed each other’s company, as little as it was because we both helped each other out in taking care of our flat."

    "Answer": "In our country, it is quite common that close relatives move to live with a family for a few days, especially when someone needs to stay in a different city or province. For instance, whenever my uncle, aunt or grandparents come to the city we live in, they stay with us at our home. This is mostly a short-term stay, but on a few occasions, it can be for a long. For this cue card topic, I would like to talk about my uncle Joseph who moved to our house and stayed with us for approximately 2 years.\n\nMy uncle, Joseph, is the youngest brother of my father and a renowned football player in our hometown. As soon as he finished his high school graduation, he moved to our family and got admitted to a college. As an elder brother, my father took his responsibilities. My uncle stayed with us for about 2 years and then moved to his own apartment after he managed a steady job for himself.\n\nI liked him very much and when he moved to our house, I was very pleased. I am the only child of my parents and when my uncle started living with us, I felt like I have got a good friend and someone to talk to about everything. Joseph was an interesting and talented person. We often talked for a long and went out to watch movies. Both of us got involved in some sporting activities and he often helped me in my studies.\n\nSince Joseph was a nice person and respected my parents, they also liked him. I never felt irritated or disturbed due to his presence at our home. As an intelligent person, Joseph knew how to behave and treat other members of a family, especially who are close family members. He is now married to a woman who is a lecturer at a college, and they have a two years old daughter now. I still miss some of the activities we did together. Though he was my uncle, I often felt like he was the brother I never had!"

Well, my grandma used to live with us here in Melbourne for a few years and I would like to talk about her. Before she moved to live in our house, she was in Perth with my grandfather. However, after my grandfather died, my father insisted her to come and live with us.\n\nOur family had only three members at that time - my dad, mom and me. My grandma was the fourth member and still, she was an adorable one whose presence was very welcomed. She was a lovely lady in her mid-60s. In her early days, she was one of the prettiest ladies in the locality where she lived. She got married to my grandpa, and they spent most of their life in Perth. My grandpa died when he was 76 years old.\n\nIn fact, my father asked my grandma to come and live with us as soon as my grandfather dies. She, however, took a year to move to Melbourne. My grandma had stayed with us for more than four years and then she decided to get back to Perth after one of my aunts got divorced and decided to relocate in our hometown. I believe she wanted to support her daughter at a tough time and we could not insist on her to stay with us.\n\nMy grandma loves me most among all her grandchildren and thus she loved to pass her times with me. I had a great time when she was with us and I cried when she left. She even thought to sell her house in Perth and live with us permanently. But finally could not do so. I share a special bond with her and she loves me dearly.  When she came to live with us, I had been exhilarated and I had someone to support and love me unconditionally.\n\nAs a person, my grandmother was a role-model. She was kind and helpful to others. She loved gardening and I was her evening partner to take care of the garden. She helped me in some of my tough times by telling stories from her life which have inspired me to a great extent. I would never forget the good time I had when she was at our house."

    "Answer": "I am not really one of those people who seek apology from others, even in situations when an apology is due. I am sure that there are many people like me. But that doesn’t necessarily deter the more polite who like to apologize just like the banker who apologized to me the other day.\n\nAnyway, it was about a few months ago when I had to go to a bank in my hometown in order to get a copy of my bank statement. I needed that bank statement because I was applying to get a visa to visit one European country. But, in my town, getting a bank statement from any bank was a herculean task. And, this is due to the fact that the bank officials have to take care of thousands of customers every day. So, when I entered the bank to get my bank statement, I knew that my patient was going to be fully tested, and I was fine with that.\n\nBut, what I wasn’t fine with, however, was that I had to go and talk to at least 5/6 bank officials to find about the officer who actually was authorized to give me my bank statement. Then, eventually, the waiting game started to test my patience, and I also kept waiting like a gentleman. After all, I needed to get my bank statement. Finally, after almost an hour, my turn came to visit the banker who would give me the bank statement. As soon as I reached near the desk of the officer, I politely asked him what took him so long. He understood my frustration and immediately apologized to me for the delay, saying that they were having some problems with their computer servers.\n\nAnyway, the act of apology suddenly made me feel better even though I knew that I was going to wait for a long time to get my bank statement. I also felt that I couldn’t actually blame any single person for that unfortunate delay as the very system was slow, even though I was sincerely praying and hoping that they would do something to expedite their work process."

    "Answer": "Apologising is a part of good manners and I believe that it often pacifies many chaotic situations. Whenever I believe that someone owes me an apology, I do not hesitate to apologise to this person. In many events, others have apologised to me and I would talk about one such event for this candidate task card topic.\n\nIt was around 3-4 months ago when the chief cashier of the City bank profoundly apologised to me. I cannot recall his name but my best guess would be ' Mr Jonathon'. He was a middle-aged white male and would be 5 feet 11 or so.\n\nI went to the (...say your bank area name...) City bank branch to withdraw some money. It was unusually crowded and I had to wait in a queue for about 25 minutes. As soon as I presented the cheque leaf, the cashier verified my signature and checked other information on his computer system. Within a minute, he returned my cheque and informed me that my savings bank account with them did not have sufficient balance. His facial expression was quite rough and he advised me to check my balance before presenting any cheque leaf. I tried to explain to him that I deposited a large amount of money the previous day and he should check it before rejecting my cheque. He was adamant and non-cooperative. He asked me to contact the chief cashier for any complaint and leave the cash counter to let others do banking - which was very harsh and unprofessional, I guess. It was a frustrating experience for me.  \n\nWhen I explained the chief cashier the whole situation, he checked the computer system and found that my claim was absolutely correct. In fact, it was their fault that my deposit was not credited to my savings account. The chief cashier then apologised to me profoundly. He took my cheque leaf and cashed it out himself. He apologised to me several times and promised me that such an event won't happen again.\n\nHonestly speaking, when the cashier rejected my cheque, I felt quite angry and irritated. I knew that I had deposited a large sum of money and there was no way he should reject my cheque. I become angrier when he behaved as if I was a fool to present the cheque without having any balance! The chief cashier's manner and friendly behaviour, on the other hand, was quite professional and amiable. He attentively listened to my explanation and retracted as soon as he found that I was right and if there was anyone to be blamed, it would be his teller, not me. His cordial response and regret reassured me and I excused the unprofessional behaviours of the teller who denied my cheque. I accepted the apology and left the bank without any hard feelings."

    "Answer": "It is confusing when a teacher comes with an apology. In fact, I had a similar experience in my 8th semester at Columbia University in New York. I will describe the event in brief now and thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to talk about this event.\n\nIn my 8th semester, I had to attend a course conducted by Dr Robert Brown. He is a man of letters and knows his subject very well. He has a very sharp sense of rights and wrongs and never compromises on the issues of sincerity. Dr Brown never forced his student to study hard, rather he suggested them to get into the subjects or texts they study. He preferred and inspired the students to understand the topics and the subject as a whole, rather than merely memorising them. Hence, he was a great and popular teacher among the students. A simple mistake and his sincere apology raised his position higher to me and to the remaining class.\n \nDr Brown was assigned to take our course E 301 – Basic Economics. He took the classes and delivered lectures very professionally. I also attended all of his classes and came to know about different economics-related terms and their use in real-life. So, when we appeared on the semester final exam, we encountered with the math he had shown us before. I answered them perfectly. Unfortunately, he made a simple mistake while checking my answer script. But when I was given the script to check after his evaluation, I discovered the mistake. And he apologised to me very sincerely.\n\nAt the beginning of the 9th semester, all the exam scripts were given to us to inform our parents and check back if there was any discrepancy. I was in the class when I found the matter. Instantly, I informed the fact to Dr Brown that there was a mistake in counting the marks. Since he was busy with the exam script distribution, he assured me that he will look into the matter later. Once the exam scripts were distributed, he asked me to meet him with the answer sheet, and he admitted his mistake when I showed him that he did not count the mark of an answer.\n\nHe felt sorry for his mistake and apologised to me. He also said that if I had not noticed the discrepancy, my grade could have gone lower than I deserve. He sincerely regretted the mistake. He immediately corrected the score. So, my score bumped up and I was happy. But by the same time, I felt a bit confused that an individual like Dr Brown is seeking an apology from me for his error. However, it was a different experience for me indeed."

    "Answer": "Our world has witnessed many historical events since our human story started. While some of these historical events are not that significant in the greater scheme of things, the others have been quite phenomenal and have changed the course of history to a great extent. Today, I would like to talk about one such historical even which pretty much changed the course of politics in the continent of North America.\n\nThe historical event, I am talking about, is the assassination of Abraham Lincoln which took place on 14th of April of 1865. It happened just when everybody thought that the civil war, which started, mainly because Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery, between the north and south, was over in the USA, and everybody thought that the 11 southern states would finally come back and join the then Union of USA. \n\nBut, the conservatives in the south part of the USA didn’t agree with that decision since the southern conservatives and white supremacists were never ready to give up their belief that slavery was part of the natural order of things. In fact, they believed that drastic action must be taken if slavery was to be preserved, and the only way it could be done was to kill Abraham Lincoln. So, they started their plots one after another to kill the union president until they eventually succeeded when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by one Southerner called John Wilkes Booth.\n\nAnyway, as sad and tragic of an event was the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, it was because of this sad and tragic even the politics of the USA had changed forever and for better, of course. In fact, the assassination actually united the whole people in the union, more thoroughly than ever, with a common sentiment of devotion to the country and of profound grief for the great calamity, that had fallen upon it. All party rancour was hushed. Political strife had ceased. All men of all parties, feeling a common interest and common grief, stood together in support of the nation, and of the man thus suddenly charged with the execution of the people's will."

    "Answer": "I believe that history is much beyond the battles, conflicts, inventions and birth of great people who shape the world. History is the past events and time that shape the world and touch the lives of the humankind. The recent significant events like 9/11 – World Trade Center attack, the invention of the telephone, the birth of Muhammad or Jesus Christ, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria are all significant historical events that have changed the world profoundly. For this cue card topic, I would like to talk about the ‘Invasion of Poland by Germany in 1939.’\n\nThis is a historic event that has changed the whole world drastically. If this did not occur, Hiroshima and Nagasaki would have been spared, World War II could have been avoided, several million people would not have to die, British would have ruled many parts of the world still today, the world superpower would have been different countries than those we see today, and we would have a different economic and political agenda these days. The cold war and Arms Race are thought to be triggered by this event and the world’s politics were changed and that would influence even the future world politics. All these major changes were the direct or indirect results of a single event – German’s decision to invade Poland.\n\nThis historic event is also known as the Poland Campaign. On September 01, 1939, German forces bombard Poland and Adolf Hitler of Germany was the mastermind for this invasion. As a result, World War II began.\n\nWorld War II is one of the rare wars that has changed world history, power, politics and still influences the future politics. From this regards, the invasion of Poland in 1939 is a highly influential historical event."

    "Answer": "The world has witnessed numerous events in every decade that sometimes shape the future course, but not all of them are historic. Amid millions of historical events, the birth of Muhammad is one of the most influential, I believe. I thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about this historical event with a paramount importance.\n\nAccording to the religion of Islam, Muhammad is the last prophet and there would be no other prophets after him. He was sent by God to spread the words of God and to turn people civilised in that ancient era when chaos was the norm of the society amid the Arabs. Muhammad was born to a noble family in Arabia known as Quraish in 570 AD. He lost his parents in his early childhood and was brought up by his uncles. He is also known as the Holy Prophet of Islam and the central figure who worked relentlessly to spread Islam among people. His influence turned millions of people to convert to Islam and it is the second large religion in the world. Therefore, his birth is an important event in human history, I believe.   \n\nMuhammad's early life was filled with struggles. He initially was brought up by his grandfather and then by his uncle, Abu Talib. During his lifetime, the region of Arabia was filled with ignorance, the indiscriminating killing of baby girls was a very usual activity while people believed in several gods and worshipped idols. The people did not give up their ancestors’ faith and thus Muhammad was inflicted with a large number of both mental and physical torments. But he ensured the practice of Islamic belief till his last day on earth.\n\nHe did not receive any formal education but he was the most intelligent person of that time. He used to seclude himself in a cave, Hira, where he received revelation. He was around 40 when the revelation happened. Since then, he started preaching Islam as a religion secretly with the proclamation that God is only one and He is to be worshipped alone. He also preached that he was the prophet and messenger of God to preach Islam. Gradually he started getting followers but at the same time, the idolaters of Mecca started opposing Him.     \n\nThe birth of Muhammad is an event of high historical importance. It has to be admitted that Muhammad is the most influential man ever. He was filled with superior humane qualities. He had to leave his motherland fearing attacks from the non-believers but when he won Mecca after battles, he forgave all those who wanted him to be killed. He is, in fact, an idol for every human being regardless of religion. Even many of the non-believers term him as the best human ever born in this world.\n\nHis birth defines the starting of the supreme religion - Islam. The historical events like World War I & II have a great effect on the human civilisation but not even close to the birth of this great man. The world has changed to a great extent by the influence of this man. No other human history would be that profound and intensifying as his birth is."

    "Answer": "I think that \"creativity\" is something which not everybody has or it is a quality that is not shared by everybody. So, it is quite possible that we don’t really meet this kind of creative people in our everyday life, unless we are lucky, just like I was lucky to meet somebody from my college.\n\nHowever, that \"somebody\" was also a good friend of mine, and his name was 'Rabbi'. We attended the same college. Both of us were students of science, but he was way more brilliant student than me. And, his being a brilliant student was one of the main reasons that I used to make time to hang out with him, but that, of course, is a different story.\n\nAnyway, among many things, that we did together, one thing which we really enjoyed doing was to listen to all kinds of music from different countries as well as watching movies. But, apart from watching movies and listening to music from different countries, he also had a hobby reading poetries from different writers. Yes, he just loved poems, and he didn’t only love reading them but also could write poems on his own. In fact, he had such a creative mind that sometimes, I would choose a random word for him, he could write a complete poem of four to eight lines within minutes at ease. And, by the way, the words which he used to create those poetries were no ordinary or meaningless words, but rather they were some very standard and meaningful words.\n\nAnyway, I admire Rabbi, mainly because even though he was a brilliant science student, it just puzzled me how possibly he could also have such a creative mind for literature. Besides, I haven’t heard of many people who would divide their times equally for studying science and poetries at the same time. I admire him also because even though he had all the qualities to become a renowned poet, he didn’t really have any visible ambition in that department. In fact, he very seldom would have talked about his hidden creativity to others."

The Nobel Prize for literature is awarded both for lasting literary merit and for evidence of consistent idealism to a great extent. Dylan's songs have such creativity, consistent idealism and universal appeal and without any doubt, he is a very talented and creative person.\n\nHe is such a powerful and influential singer that his song like 'The times they are a-changing' and 'Blowing in the wind' became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. \n\nHis creative and dazzling lyrics incorporate a vast range of social, political, psychological, philosophical, and literary influences. As a musician, he has sold more than 10 million records. Besides, he is also a talented painter. \n\nI knew him first when I  heard his song 'Slow Train' from his album 'Slow Train Coming' in my early college days.

I know him as a revered songwriter and he is one of my favourite singers of all time. \n\nI admire him mostly because of his talent and outstanding contribution to the music, lyrics, and literary works through his songwriting. There were times when his music personally inspired me, motivated me and helped me forget my pain. I have never met him in person but he seems like someone I know for a long and very closely.

He is one of the most successful Hollywood film directors and in my opinion one of the most talented and creative people alive. I would like to thank you for this opportunity to let me talk about a creative person.\n \nSteven Allan Spielberg is commonly known as Steven Spielberg. He was born in 1946. He is not only a director of some awesome movies but is also highly reputed as a producer and his extraordinary skills as a scriptwriter. In fact, Hollywood has entered into a new era with direct support from Spielberg. He introduced some of the newest genres and made them popular with his charming direction. As a result, he took a permanent berth in the history of Hollywood. Besides, the list of achievements for his efforts is adorable as well. He won several prestigious awards for his outstanding activities, including the Academy Award, with plots, casts and their performance.\n\nSteven Spielberg is not only creative; he is a genius. Most of his movies deal with some exceptional issues. Consequently, he won the hearts of the global population. He is on moviemaking career for over 40 years and has made a notable number of quality movies. The movies directed by Spielberg are quite different from contemporary ideas. He initiated the Science Fiction in Hollywood and after its success, he moved to make movies on humanitarian grounds. Some of his movies have created a sense of justification among his audiences. He mostly experimented with some specific genres and made the masterpieces with his magical ability. He knows how to select casts and crews and never cuts ties with the people he comes in touch. This is the key reason behind his popularity.    \n\nWhen I was a teenager, I used to watch movies for entertainment. In fact, I was not matured enough to understand the movie plots of performances from the casts. Hence, there was no specific selection. One day, I watched a movie named Jaws and it attracted me most. Then I started gathering information about the movie and finally came to know about the movie director – Steven Spielberg. Until then, I did not have any interest in the movie makers or their plots. I just watched the movies for my entertainment and loved the movies that come with actions. But gradually the sense of appreciation grew into me. Then I was charmed with this movie maker of Hollywood.   \n\nAfter starting his career in Hollywood, Spielberg experimented on some specific genres which were overlooked before. He revived them with his own efforts. He worked on many themes and genres of movie-making in ages and turned out to be a successful director. It was not merely his luck that dragged him towards success, rather it was his hard efforts and perseverance. Almost all of the movies he made were successful and brought him the reputation of a great director. I have enjoyed all of his movies made so far and realised the different tastes. Each of the movies is completely different in terms of plots, cast, locations, innovative ideas, application of technology and more other issues while some of the movies have broken the box office records. For all such reasons, I admire him most."

    "Answer": "Actually, there are a number of contemporary TV hosts, whom I happen to admire, because, to be honest, they all add value to their 'programmes and shows' in many significant ways. Today, I would like to talk about one of those TV hosts and tell you who he really is, what kinds of programmes he presents, and how he actually does his job.\n\nThe name of this TV host is Conan O’Brien. Born in April of 1963, Conan O’Brien is an American late-night talk-show personality and comedian who is more popularly known as the host of Late Night with Conan O’Brien (1993–2009), The Tonight Show(2009–10), and Conan (2010–present).  \n\nHaving graduated from the Harvard University, where he majored in American History and Literature, Conan has extensively written for the humour magazine, news-show parody, late-night comedy show and famous cartoon series before eventually entering the world of the late-night TV talk show in 1993.  Anyway, Conan O’Brien has a very distinctive style and approach, primarily because most of his jokes in his late-night talk show are very realistic and tried to uncover the truth without hurting anybody’s feeling. Besides, I really like his careful word choices, which may sound very funny and witty, but they always carry an implied message for his audience.  \n\nBesides, as long as he runs his late show, there is no dull moment in it since he always seems to be so pumped up. I think that this sort of wits and the attention-holding ability of an audience is only possible for a guy who has an IQ level of 160 which is, by the way, the IQ of Stephen Hawkins.\n\nAnyway, I like Conan O’Brien, mainly because he is a truly professional comedian who doesn’t only know about both the worlds of British comedy and American comedy, but also he knows exactly when to crack them.  Besides, he knows perfectly well how to control the emotion of his audience. Finally, I like him so much because he seems to be a very down to earth kind of guy for a popular talk show host."

    "Answer": "A television presenter is a person who hosts a programme. A presenter often makes the programme worth watching. Worldwide known TV hosts like Ellen DeGeneres, Donald Trump, Fiona Bruce, Jerry Springer, Andrea McLean, Alex Jones, Oprah Winfrey, Chris Tarrant and many others have become very famous for their extraordinary performance and talent. They are known for their distinctive style and outstanding performance. For this cue card topic, I would like to talk about Fiona Bruce, who is a famous TV presenter, producer and news presenter.\n\nHer full name is Fiona Elizabeth Bruce and she is a famous British TV presenter and journalist. I like her very much due to her authoritative presence, commitment to her work, distinctive presentation style and creative journalism. Initially, she joined the BBC in 1989 and later on, she has gone to present many famous programmes like Antique Roadshow, BBC News at Ten, BBC News at Six, Fake or Fortune and Real Story.  \n\nAntiques Roadshow is a BBC programme, more specifically a television show in which \"antique appraisers\" travel to different places in the UK to appraise antiques bought by local people. Fiona Bruce in the presenter of this programme and her noteworthy presentation has made this a popular TV show in Britain. BBC News at Ten is deputised by Fiona and this is the final comprehensive news programme of the day on BBC One. Similarly, BBC News at Six is an evening news programme and Fiona Bruce is one of the news presenters of this programme. Be it a news show or any other type of TV programme, Fiona Bruce maintains a professional and creative appearance. This makes her a distinctive and notable presenter.

    "Answer": "Larry King is one of the most successful TV and radio presenters in the USA. He is my favourite presenter and I have been watching his programs for long. He is mostly famous for the interviews with the renowned people across the world. I personally thank you, sir, for this opportunity to let me talk about a TV presenter I really like.\n \nInitially, Larry King was known as Lawrence Harvey Zeiger but it was really a difficult name to remember for his audience. So, he changed his name to Larry King as per the directives from one of his program makers. His early life was filled with struggle and hardly had the chances to show his potentials to the audiences. Finally, he got the chance as a journalist and since then he is on the top of popularity for his analytical skills, ready wits and smartness. In fact, he is an idol for many of the aspiring journalists around the world.  \n\nLarry King is most famous for his interview program – Larry King Live which was aired on CNN. He ran the program from 1985 to 2010. This was a live program on the television channel where he took interviews of different people including politicians, celebrities, artists and many others. for his outstanding performance as a host, he has received a large number of awards including 10 Cable ACE Awards, two Peabody etc. He began his career in the 50s and took next 10 years to emerge as a star in this arena. He also played the role of an all-night broadcaster in the national radio in 1978. At present, he hosts \"Larry King Now\" and \"Politicking with Larry King\".\n\nThe representation of the programs hosted by King is interesting to me. I am amazed at the semi-informal tones that he uses during the interviews. It appears that Larry King is bringing out the truth from the interviewees in a sophisticated manner. Sometimes, the truths are bitter and also raise controversies, I think this is the right manner to interview someone. He knows the methods to discover the inner self of a man. I like the way he asks the very personal questions and the interviewees do not feel shy to answer them to the public. Besides, he narrates some of the special information about the guests at the programs that even amazes the guests as well. Another important aspect that he is one of the most successful hosts who never had any misunderstanding with the guests in his episodes.\n\nLarry King is one of the most influential people in the country. I like him most for some of his personal qualities. He is a radio and television program host and at the same time, he is a writer. He has already written a couple of books after his heart disorder. Moreover, he is a man of charity and has donated to some charitable works. King is a man of benevolence and knows how to respect people and even his opponents. He began his career when he had nothing with him and now he owns a lot of fame and definitely he is rich enough. But he is still the same as he was 40 years ago when he was to begin his career in Florida."

    "Answer": "I am no traffic law expert nor would I be able to separate the traffic laws of one particular country from another. But, I like to believe for sure that each and every country in the world has its own set of traffic laws to maintain order and discipline on their roads. Today, I would like to talk about one such traffic law in my country which I know and admire.\n\nThe law, I am talking about, is a law that allows the traffic authority of my country to punish a drunk driver by suspending his driver’s licence for a long period of time and then putting him into prison for 2 years. In addition to these punishments, the authority is also allowed to issue them a traffic ticket of some hefty amount of money.\n\nBy the way, I learned about this particular traffic law, in addition to all other traffic laws of my country, because I needed to learn about these laws in order to get a driver’s license after passing the written test as well as a road test. I also think that this kind of strict (perhaps even more strict than the one my country has now) laws are there in many other countries of the world, but there also may be a country or two, like Costa Rica, where it is not illegal to drink an alcoholic beverage while driving.\n\nAnyway, I am sure that such countries have their reasons for not enacting a law against drinking alcohol and driving, but I sure am glad that we have such a law in my country, and I sure try to follow this rule word by word.\n\nAnyway, I think that such a law is very important for a country like mine where roads and streets are always crowded with all kinds of vehicles. This particular law has certainly helped my country by reducing the number of deadly accidents over the years. Besides, this law is important not only because it helps reduce the loss of life, but also unnecessary financial loss, especially, when vehicles are severely damaged in accidents."

    "Answer": "Traffic laws or traffic regulations are in place to ensure the safety of the vehicles, passengers, drivers and other people. While some traffic laws are universal, some vary country to country or even state to state. 'Drunk Driving Law' is a common traffic law that I learned while I prepared for the driving licence test a few years ago.\n\nThe Drunk Driving law prohibits drivers to drive a motorised vehicle when they are under the influence of alcohol or any other drugs, including any type of recreational drugs or those prescribed by the physicians. The acceptable limit of blood alcohol content may vary from country to country but the main objective of this law is to prohibit people who are incapable of operating a motor vehicle on the road due to the influence of alcohol or any other drugs.\n\nBefore taking the driving licence test, I had to prepare for a written test and from there I learned about many traffic laws and regulations including this 'Drunk Driving Law'. As part of my preparation for the test, I also browsed a few websites and online resources to learn more about it.\n\nSafe driving is a top-most priority for me. I often drive when my family members sit in the car. As a law-abiding citizen, I try to follow every traffic rules in place. I have never been charged or even fined for any traffic rule violation and that, I guess, proves that I abide by the traffic rules very strictly.\n\nWhy is Drunk Driving law important? - Well, all over the world traffic accidents are predominantly caused by driving under alcohol and drug influence. If this law not in place, the outcome would have been more catastrophic. One of the main reasons for youth mortality in Europe these days is driving under influence. More than $60 billion damages are caused by this single reason each year. Driving while drunk is a criminal offence and this law prevents many accidents and damages on the roads. No doubt this is quite an important traffic law that safeguards many lives and ensures safety on the road."

    "Answer": "Driving a vehicle is really fun. But to derive the fun, one should know about the traffic rules and abide by them. Stopping the vehicle on a red light or stop sign is one of those rules that every driver should follow. I thank you for this nice Candidate Task Card and for the time you have allowed to talk about it.\n \nIn fact, a red light is considered as the stop sign on roads and streets. When the red light is on, it means that the vehicles plying on the roads should stop for a certain moment until the red light turns green. In this time, usually, pedestrians cross the street or another road is kept open for vehicle movement. Besides, the sign of red light is also used to stop the vehicles in case of emergencies. Moreover, the red lights on the vehicles also refer to the same. When those are on while driving, it denotes the cars are about to stop. Hence, it appears that the use of the red light is diversified.\n\nWhen I was 18, I learnt driving from a professional school. I learnt about the law from that school. In fact, I had some ideas about the red light but was unaware of the complete use of the sign and about the law. Usually, when the red light is on at the streets, the drivers are to stop their vehicles near the pole where the lights are mounted. Besides, the light is also used for indicating danger ahead in any parts of the streets. So, I was glad learning about the use of red lights on the streets. Now, the lights are found in traffic signals and behind the cars.   \n\nOf course, I follow the rule. In fact, this is a law in the USA to follow the red light signals. If someone does not follow the red light while driving, it often considered as a serious offence and the drivers are even punished to some extent if they do not follow the sign. Actually, if the red light signal is violated, there are lots of chances of accidents. While I was learning to drive a car, my instructor told me to always follow the red light signals. So, whenever I am on the street with my Dodge Challenger, I try to follow all the traffic rules and especially the red light sign.  \n\nFollowing traffic rules is mandatory for each of the drivers on the street. If they do not follow the rules, especially the red light meant to stop the vehicle, a massive disorder may take place. The chances are more on junctions or on crossroads. When a driver does not follow the stop signal and drives the vehicle, certainly there will be some negative consequences. The stop/ start signs are synchronised on the street- when there is a red light on a corner, it means there is a green light in somewhere else of the same junction. So, if a driver avoids the red light from his corner, surely he is to create a disorder on the street. The consequences are highly detrimental for everyone on the street. Therefore, it is important to follow the red light or stop signals while driving on the road."

    "Answer": "In Malaysia, we have several important days and events that we celebrate in our country. While all of these important days spread the love and harmony, none of them really brings all Malaysians as close as the “Heri Merdeka” which is the independence day of Malaysia.\n\nThis important day is on August 31st. On this very day, a regally-attired bespectacled man, popularly known as the father of the Malaysian Independence Mr Tunku Abdul Rahman, stood up in the field at Merdeka Stadium of Kuala Lumpur and declared ‘Merdeka!’ seven times to thunderous applause from the thousands of people gathered there.\n\nMerdeka in the Malay language means “independence”. And with that resounding chanting and applause from thousands of Malaysians, our great country Malaysia finally gained its independence from the British rule in the year of 1957. This Independence Day celebration is different from other celebrations because every year since 1957, there has been a new them for its celebration. For example, last year (in the year of 2019) was ‘Sayangi Malaysiaku: Malaysia Bersih’, which translates to ‘Love My Malaysia: A Clean Malaysia’.\n\nWe Malaysians celebrate this independence day with a truly festive mood as people from all walks of life show their love for the country by displaying flags on their cars, outside their homes and on the facade of shop-houses. Then they also attend the independence day parade, both large and small, in different parts of Malaysia in addition to our capital city. Besides, many cultural performances are also held in different parts of our country on this important national day.\n\nAnyway, this national day is an important day for us to celebrate because it unites the citizens from all walks of life in our country in a common cause, and that is to understand and appreciate the many blessings and gifts our great country has received. Besides, the celebration also allows us to get together with our families and friends from all over the country and enjoy some good time which is not always possible in this large scale at any other time of the year."

    "Answer": "I live in New York City in the USA and Christmas is a very important day that all the Americans celebrate. 25th December is the Christmas day and this is a major celebration around the world. The day celebrates Jesus Christ's birthday and it is an annual celebration which is a significant event in my country.\n\nAs 25th December is the commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, this is a religious as well as cultural celebration in the USA. This is a public holiday in our country. In the United States of America, there are different traditions and ways of celebrating this day. Gift-giving is a part of this celebration and people exchange gifts to observe this day. Symbolic decoration, family gathering and feasting are also part of this day. People often buy gifts for their dear and beloved ones and sharing a traditional meal with the family is an integral part of this celebration. Gift giving and other shopping-related activities of the Christmas make it a key sales period for the business. Christmas celebration in our country also includes Christmas card exchanging, completing an Advent calendar, carolling and Christmas music, lighting a Christingle, Church services, different decoration including Christmas trees, candles, candy, canes, wreaths, lights, garlands and many more activities- both religious and traditional. Santa clause is also associated with the tale that he brings gifts to children.\n\nIn the days preceding Christmas, many Catholics hold religious processions. In my opinion, family reunions and exchanging gifts are the two most significant parts of this festival. Many churches and homes display illuminated, Nativity scenes commemorating the humble birth of Jesus. People in my country love to decorate their houses - both inside and outside. Rockefeller Centre in New York has a huge Christmas tree with a public ice skating rink. I often visit this place with my friends.\n\nThe Christmas is quite a different celebration in terms of its significance, traditional prospects, religious value, variations in celebrations among different nations, its effects on businesses, and moreover the wide-spread acceptance and participation of non-Christians of this festival. People prepare for this day for the whole December and gather with family members which make it a unique festival in the USA.\n\nThis is without any doubt the most significant celebration among the Christian people all around the world. As the USA has a majority of the Christian population, Christmas is an important religious and cultural event for them. This is the remembrance of Jesus Christ and a very important day for the whole Christian community and this is especially true for the USA."

    "Answer": "Celebrations in Russia are a bit different from other countries. Some of the celebrations here take place with majestic preparations and last longer. White Nights Festival is one of the most popular festivals for my city St. Petersburg and for this cue card topic I would love to talk about this celebration.\n\nThe festival lasts for around or over a month. Usually, it begins from May each year and lasts till the early part of July. At this time, the nights turn brighter in St. Petersburg. It happens as this is the most northern city in the world. Due to its geographical location, the sun does not set like it is seen in the other parts of the world. Even, the difference between day and night is not distinguished at all for the bright sun. In fact, the nights turn white and marking the event, the citizens celebrate the days. Interestingly, since there are no dark, even at the night time, the municipal authorities do not need to switch on the street lights for many days during this time.\n\nGenerally, this is the time for festivals. A wide number of cultural festivals take place in this period and most of them happen at night times. The White Nights have become the symbol of the city and many of the festival-loving people wait for the month eagerly. Almost all the festivals are enriched with cultural elements of the locality. Marking the festival, different performances take place in the city theatres, open spaces and in concert halls. Most of the time the White Nights Festival is organized by the city administration of St. Petersburg. The festival begins in May and inaugurated with the Starts of the White Nights event which is a series of ballet and opera performance. Classical ballet is the key attraction of this event and a pre-booking of tickets is a must to enjoy the show.\n\nThis White Nights Festival is completely different from the other festivals. The majority of the festivals take place either in the first or last part of the year but this one takes place almost in the middle of the year. Besides, the festival is not linked up with any special occasions or to pay tribute to any specific issues. Rather, this is a festival to pass some leisure hours in complete relaxation. There are hardly any differences between day and night times. So, the people enjoy their moments in the period of White Nights. In addition, the entire city becomes the stage for local and international stars. A notable number of international stars perform here. The carnivals that take place during this time are also adorable and completely different from the other carnivals and shows that take place at other times of the year.   \n\nThis is an important festival in the country and particularly for the locals of St. Petersburg. A good number of crowd gathers every year in this place to enjoy the shows. The festival is one of the largest ones in the country and people and artists often wear costumes that represent the past days. Fun is the synonym of the festival. Since it lasts longer, people have more time to make fun and enjoy themselves. Besides, public events like the Scarlet Sails is an event of high importance. The fireworks, concerts and water shows fill the night with enchantment. For all such reasons, the White Night Festival is very important."

    "Answer": "I am not usually a forgetful person, even on my worst day, since I try to keep everything in my possession as organised as possible. But, then again, I am also a human, and as such, I do tend to forget about important things on a rare occasion just like I forgot to carry my train ticket the other day.\n\nWell, forgetting a train ticket wasn’t exactly supposed to be a big deal if I had bought it on the internet. But, unfortunately, like the other times, I couldn’t buy it from online as, according to the railway ticket authority, the computer server of the train ticket issuing authority was not working properly, which meant that I actually needed to travel quite a distance to buy that ticket from the rail station.\n\nAnd, that’s probably the reason that I forgot to pick up the ticket from my home before heading to the rail station. Let me explain why I thing like that. Actually, since I always buy the ticket online, I don’t really have to have a hard copy of the ticket in my hand as the ticket authority always sends me a text message on my phone and to my email address. So, when I go to the station, all I do to pick up my hard copy is to just show that message or tell my phone number to the ticket issuing clerk. In other words, there is no issue here of taking my ticket to my home, only to forget to pick it up later on. By the way, that ticket was really important as I needed to travel to my corporate head office in another town in order to attend a really important training session. \n\nSo, anyway, as soon as I remembered that I forgot to pick up the ticket, I immediately took a taxi back to my home, since luckily, I still had some time in my hand, to pick up my ticket. In the meanwhile, I also called my corporate head office and explained the situation so that they could make some other arrangement for my training."

    "Answer": "I have recently graduated from college and my major was finance. Though I have already left my college, my memories related to my academic years are still vivid. On one occasion, I forgot to submit an important assignment and for this cue card topic, I would like to talk about this event.\n\nI was in my 8th semester at that time and in a coursework, we were supposed to submit an assignment which alone carried 40% marks of this course. The pass mark for each coursework was 50% and due to this, the assignment was so crucial for every student.\n\nThe teacher who took this course was a guest teacher from another college. As I recall, his name was Stuart and he was around 40 years old. In the last month of our course, he assigned individual assignments to every student and gave us a deadline for the submission. He warned us not to copy-and-paste any part of the assignment and he had a reputation for dealing with the plagiarism very strictly. He also told us that the only reason someone might fail in this course is due to the plagiarism in his assignment. I worked on the assignment and completed almost 80% to 85% of it until I got a severe fever. I had to see a doctor and take medicine to recover from this viral fever. The medical report showed that it was a viral fever and there was nothing to worry about. After a week I joined the class but unfortunately, I completely forgot my deadline for the assignment and the due date was already over! I possibly forgot it due to my sickness and distractions caused by it. Sometimes the fever was so severe that I had to take several pills together.  \n\nSoon after I realised that I have missed my deadline,  I tried to contact professor Stuart but I heard that he would not be available until the next week. It was quite a frustrating experience for me. I then concentrated on finishing my assignment and waited for the professor to get back to our college. Next week, I met him and explained everything. To my surprise, he did not seem convinced. I told him that I can show him my medical as well as the test reports, but he looked like he did not care. He got busy on his cell phone and I was literally broke! After he finished his phone conversation, he suddenly asked me the name and address of the doctor whom I saw during my illness. He, in fact, did contact this doctor and saw him personally, which I learned at a later time. He wanted to be sure that I was not making an excuse for the delay to submit my assignment and was genuinely ill. To my relief, two days later he called me into his room and gave me an email address. He asked me to send my assignment to this email address within 12 hours. I would like to mention before ending my story that I got 'A' on this assignment."

Recently, I forgot to bring my laptop which contained the important files required for the meeting.\n\nIn fact, it was my mistake. I was in a rush on the day. On the previous night, I went for attending a marriage ceremony and made late to come back home. So, I had to sleep late. As a result, I could not track the alarm. When I woke up, it was almost 8.45am while my office was to begin at 9.00am. So, I rushed towards the office and made the late. I forgot about the laptop. All the necessary files and presentations that I made a day before yesterday was on the laptop while I was supposed to present them during the meeting which was set with some of the high officials.\n\nJust after entering the office compound, I realised that I did not bring the laptop. It was the most important component of the meeting. The managing director of the office had a private meet with me a couple of weeks before. He instructed a draft and asked me to make a details plan that will include the sales targets, strategies, analysis of competitors’ performance, allocation of responsibilities and more other issues. Without the laptop, it was impossible to present the data and analysis to high officials at the meeting. Moreover, I did not have the ideas on my mind right then. So, without the laptop, I was unable to run the meeting and I had to go back home to bring it.  \n\nGenerally, when there is something important at the office of the meeting, event, field trip etc., I try to make a reminder about the issue on my cell phone. Besides, I take a note and keep that in the daily appointment book – provided by the office. But I was unable to make anything of them due to participation at the marriage ceremony of my college buddy. I complete the tasks after the office hours or before leaving the office. But, I could not create any reminder for the meeting as some of my friends came to my office to grab me and go together to the ceremony. Amid their chaos, I was unable to create any new reminder or check the former ones. Moreover, I was late to return home and everything got disorganised. As a direct result, I made the mistake.  \n\nIt was hard to ask my boss to move into my home again to get the laptop. So, without mentioning anything to anyone, I left for home to bring the laptop. In the middle of my way, I received a phone call from my immediate boss asking about my location and why I was late. I replied with a false excuse that I was stuck in a huge traffic jam. In fact, he is well aware of the traffic congestions in Delhi. Luckily, I reached home within a short time and brought back the laptop. The meeting started in the afternoon as the participants were unable to join in the morning for some sudden change in their schedule. So, I was relieved, made some other changes to the plans and presented the revised copy to the meeting. My plans were accepted with some minor modifications."

    "Answer": "Describing a person has never exactly been my “forte” but describing Rebecca, who was my roommate until recently, is rather easy because she is very much like an open book.\n\nNow, being a woman, I should always appreciate Rebecca because when I was really struggling to find a suitable place to stay as a new university student in a big city, after moving from my small home town, it was she who came to me as a ‘saviour” as a roommate. Besides, when Rebecca told me that she had the same major as mine, I didn’t think a second time about becoming her roommate. After moving with her as a roommate, I also came to know that Rebecca didn’t really have many friends, just like me, relating to her became even easier.\n\nRebecca was also very good with her time management skills, and so it was not really easy for me to sleep or waste my time when we needed to study. So, it is fair to say that Rebecca had a really good influence on me as far as my study was concerned. By the way, one of the main reasons, for which I chose to stay with Rebecca as a roommate, was that she was living really close to the university campus which made it rather easy to commute back and forth from my university. Besides, Rebecca knew her way to make quick food or quick snacks, in case if I felt hungry suddenly, which made my life rather easy.\n\nAnyway, I don’t live with Rebecca any more now because I have already graduated from the university, and my parents don’t really like for me to live in a big city unless there is a very valid reason to do so. Besides, living in a big city was a bit expensive for me, and my parents wanted me to stay close to them and apply for suitable jobs. Finally, even if I wanted to live with Rebecca after graduation, it wasn’t really possible because Rebecca had got a good job as soon as she graduated."

I thank you for this opportunity to talk about a person I once lived with.\n\nSienna is an interior designer and works in a large private company which is reputed as one of the best designing firms in our country. She is married to a doctor and they have two children. I first met Sienna when I started living in my university residential hall. She was my roommate and was an ideal roommate with whom I stayed in the same room until I finished my graduation.\n\nOur luck brought us together and we started living in the same room without even knowing each other ever before. However, we became best friends and we were lucky to have each other as roommates and friends. She was very supportive, compassionate, talented, helpful and humble. During our senior years at our university, we could have arranged a single room for each of us and live separately. But, I did not do that and preferred to live with Sienna. She was the sister I never had! Since both of us had the same major in the university, we studied together, helped each other completing our assignments, and planned for our extracurricular activities together. That was a great help for both of us and due to the peer pressure, we always studied hard and passed most of our exams with flying colours.\n\nWhy don't we live together anymore? Well, both of us got married and we no longer are university students. We have our family and our own career and family. However, we are still good friends and she lives in the same city I live in. We often meet and our friendship is still important to us. We have so many memories together and hopefully, our friendship will last n matter how busy our lives become or how far we live."

    "Answer": "With the passage of time, families have been split and the number of nuclear families is on the rise while relationships are on the decline. In my childhood, I used to live with my cousin – Alex Bryan. But now scenarios are different. We live in different parts of the city.\n\nPresently, I live with my parents in Oakwood in Leeds in England. I have seen the unification of families in my childhood days. But due to urbanisation, the trend has been changed to a great extent. I used to live in a large family filled with happiness and more family members. As part of the living, I got Bryan, my paternal cousin. In fact, he was living with his parents at the same home we were living in. The days were great. We had lots of fun and mischievous acts together. I along with my sister and Bryan with is junior Abram had the fun. We planned for different activities and made them come true. I am proud of having such a cousin who helped me always and cared for a sibling.    \n\nWe lived for around 10 years together until my uncle shifted to Chapel Allerton area in the same city. He moved there to run his own business. Most importantly the house we lived in at that time was smaller than we needed. We were four kids together and each of us required rooms for our own. We were growing up then. But it was impossible to arrange for four more rooms in the house which were made by grandpa. Consequently, uncle decided to shift in the area where he had an established business. It was really troublesome for us, especially for me, to leave my uncle’s family. Though we are connected to each other and maintain a very warm relation, I miss the former days when we all had lots of fun together after every evening.  \n\nBryan was senior to me for two and a half years. So, I met him as a family member and more importantly as my brother. I did not consider the issue that he was my cousin rather I loved him like my own brother. The similar was for me from his part. Since the two families shared the same roof, and I had to stay with them, so I lived with him for the years. In these years, I have learnt a lot from him and experienced the finest days of life. Often Bryan used to take me for some sports with his local buddies or took me to have some adventures on the streets. Riding bicycles was his hobby and I was allowed to sit back on the bicycle while he drove it on downtown of a city.\n\nNow both of us are adults and engaged in our respective career and academic activities. The family tie has been stronger but we are unable to meet every day for the past days. Due to the uncle’s shift from our house, we had to get separated. In fact, it was the reality and I think someday we had to split for some other reasons. Relations are better when you are living separately. So, if he would have been with us, I think there would be a decline in the relationship between us and this is quite natural. Undoubtedly, we would have engaged in brawls over petty issues or there would be any emotional imbalance between us. Actually, I am realising the issues now that my uncle apprehended 15 years before. So, I no longer live with him but we maintain a cool relation."

    "Answer": "If life has taught us anything, we should all be comfortable with the fact that everything in life is pretty much expendable at some point whether we like it or not. Today, I would like to talk about one such “expendable” item which I held so dear to my heart once but sadly don’t use it anymore.  It’s my camera.\n\nIf I remember it correctly, I bought my popular brand and expensive camera about 10 years ago, when I had just finished my high school or was about to just start my university life, with the money which my late grandfather gave me as some “gift” (so, it has been more than 10 years already but feels like I bought that camera just last month. Time does fly very fast, I guess).\n\nAnyway, after buying that camera, it literally became my “best buddy” as I carried the camera wherever I went. I took it to my university to capture the pictures of my friends whether we were just hanging out or having some picnic. I also carried it to the birthdays and wedding ceremonies of my friends and relatives. Sometimes, I also took the camera to capture the beautiful images of nature, blue sky, trees, lakes and birds and any other things that celebrated life and happiness. There are just so many memories with me and my camera that it will be really difficult to put them in these limited words.\n\nAnyway, I don’t really use that camera anymore primarily because my lifestyles have changed over the years and so have the priorities in my life. Besides, I have to stay really busy with my jobs, and so there is very little or no time to play with the camera like in the past. On top of that, as I have grown older, I don’t exactly seem to enjoy the same things today as in the past. Finally, taking pictures these days doesn’t really have to be done by a camera as a smartphone can do the same rather easily."

    "Answer": "This is indeed an interesting topic and I still have some such items that I no longer use. The bicycle that I was given on my 12th birthday is one such item that I do not use anymore. In my early teenage, I used to use it almost every time I went somewhere.\n\nThis bicycle was one of the greatest gifts in my life. My father bought it for me on my 12th birthday. It's been more than a decade and I still have it. Back in our days, riding a bicycle was very popular. Most of my friends owned a bicycle. It was quite a common mode of transportation type at that time and even adults used it more than they do today. Every time I went outside, I took my bicycle. I often raced with my friends and went far away with my friends after I owned a bicycle. I rode the bicycle until I turned 17 years old when I bought a motorbike.\n\nSince I am the youngest brother among our siblings, no one used it after I replaces it with a motorbike. Honestly speaking, riding a bicycle was a hundred times safer than riding a motorbike. I was very cautious about riding the bicycle except while racing! I cannot recall any major accident during the days when I used to ride the bicycle. On the contrary, I had been involved in a few dangerous accidents while I rode the motorbike. As I was not fully grown-up at the time I rode the bicycle, I had some restrictions imposed by my elder brother and parents. Those days were quite different and owning a bicycle was a distinctive experience for me. There were times I really did not need to go outside but I made excuses to go out and ride my bicycle. This was not true when I became an adult and owned my own motorbike.\n\nWhy I no longer use the bicycle? Well- this is most probably because I am no longer a teenager! When I turned 17, I bought a motorbike and after 2 years, my family bought a car. The motorbike and car have somehow replaced the need for this bicycle. The shape and design of the bicycle were suitable for a teenager and not quite so for an adult. My childhood and adult days were quite enchanting and riding a bicycle was like being in a fairyland. On the other hand, these days, it is no longer an ideal vehicle in terms of speed. I mostly need to travel far away and a bicycle would not be able to provide the speed I need. However, a bicycle is eco-friendly transportation and I still miss those days when I felt like the King of the street with my beautiful bicycle."

    "Answer": "Walking is a good form of exercise and everyone can take part in it. To form the habit, I bought a treadmill for my home use. But I no longer use it now.  \n\nI am a bit healthier than average people. It is a genetic problem in my family. My mom is also healthier than me, in fact, she weighs around 110 KGs and I am 85. So, both of us use went to a doctor and nutritionist. After the doctor’s prescription, mom and I started walking regularly. But this is a bit difficult to walk the busy streets and there are no specific parks or walking zones available in the city currently we are living in - Apache Junction, Arizona. Often we had to take breaks from walking. So, dad presented me with a treadmill so that I could use that for walking and share with mom.      \n\nDad presented me with the treadmill in 2013. So, I am having it for the last three years and more. Initially, it was a great device that helped us a lot to burn our calories. Mom and I used to walk on the treadmill twice in a day. My dad is diabetic and he used to walk on the machine. The machine came with some extensive features like shock absorption, electricity run, stronger motor, easy to use, custom programs, handrails for safety, easy maintenance and more others. The machine served us for a notable period. I liked the features more than anything, especially the weight loss indicators. Besides, the treadmill was moderate in shape and size while the design was beautiful as well.    \n\nI have given up using the treadmill since the early part of this year. But I got the optimum use of the machine. Usually, I used to get up late in the morning and move to my college at around 11 am. But after receiving the treadmill, I started early in the morning. Then I started to walk and run on the treadmill for about one hour. It helped me a lot to burn a substantial amount of fat and calories. Moreover, when I got back home in the evening, I used to walk on the treadmill for the next half an hour. As a result, I started spending about one and a half-hour every day on the treadmill. The results were great. I lost around 25 KGs of weight within a year and it was the greatest success for me.  \n\nI have not been using this machine for a long time. In fact, I do not need it now. I have joined at an office that deals with computer hardware selling. As a marketing executive, I have to remain busy round the day. Often I make late to come home at night. My disciplined life has been undisciplined. So, I am unable to manage time to walk on the treadmill. But there are no negative impacts on my health. I have a stout body and fit for all types of works. I have to visit different locations. If the locations are far away from my office, I take the office car. But if the locations are nearby, then I take a walk. So, it seems that I need to walk for about two hours altogether in the daytime. Thereby, I do not need to use the treadmill anymore."

    "Answer": "I love living in Melbourne for some obvious reasons. In fact, Melbourne has been voted as the most livable city in the world a number of times. There are just so many things to do and so many places to visit in Melbourne that it would take someone at least a month to talk about them. But, today I would just like to talk about one of my favourite parks.\n\nThe name of the park is Alexandra Gardens, and it is conveniently located on the south bank of the Yarra River, and on the opposite side of Federation Square and the Melbourne Central Business District in Victoria. One of the most distinctive features of this park is that it connects two other beautiful parks named the Domain parklands and the beautifully-landscaped Royal Botanic Gardens. This garden park also has many palm trees, beautiful ornamental shrubs (spreading fragrance and clean air to its visitors) and star-shaped garden which is designed to represent the great federation of Australia. First laid out in 1904, the park also has some popular river-front barbecue spots and other venues to facilitate different kinds of parties and celebration. I visit this beautiful park at least once in a week if not more frequently. By the way, people can visit this place either in private cars or by using public transportation through the tram routes of 16, 1, 64, 5, 6, 67, and 72.\n\nIt is my favourite park mainly because this is rather close to the area in which I live. In fact, it takes only about 15 minutes to walk to the park. And, that 15 minutes walk feels really good for my health. I like this park also because it is situated by a river, unlike many other parks, and it allows me to enjoy the nature in its “entirety” away from the “hustling-bustling” of the city life. Finally, this is my favourite park also because visiting there allows me to meet and interact with many interesting people from all walks of life without going to some clubs or parties."

    "Answer": "Cuyahoga Valley National Park is located near my house and this is my favourite park in the city. I live in the Ohio state in the USA and this is the National Park we boast about.  \n\nCuyahoga Valley National Park is located in Summit County and Cuyahoga County, Ohio, USA and it has remarkable natural beauty, unusual ecosystem, unique geographic features and natural appeal. This park is approximately 28 kilometres away from my living place. Most of the time, I went there in my private car but public transportation and tourist buses are also available to reach the location.\n\nI have always lived in the Ohio state. I love to explore places that are new to me. Natural beauties attract me more than other charms. So far I have gone to the Cuyahoga National Park 7 to 8 times. I have also been to the American Samoa, Arches, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Everglades and Glacier Bay which are also famous National Parks in the USA. There is no certain frequency of my visit to this Cuyahoga park. In fact, this is not a kind of park that is located near the community where people often visit in the evening and morning. I need planning, free time and preparation tp visit and enjoy the Cuyahoga park.\n\nIn my opinion, Cuyahoga is great beauty and a must-visit place for whoever lives or come visit the Ohio state. It has around 32,950 acres area and it was established in October 2000. More than 2 million visitors enjoy this panoramic park each year and it is governed by the National Park Service, USA. A great variety of animals lives in this park, many visitors ride bicycles or do hiking there. I specifically remember my last visit there in 2014 when I did hiking in this park. The spectacular views of the rolling hills, winding rivers, waterfalls and caves are mind-blowing. I have always enjoyed being in this park and have a lot of sweet memories there. As a resident of the Ohio state, I am very proud of this park and the outstanding beauty and recreational activities of this park make it my favourite one."

    "Answer": "Canada is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and enriched with natural blessings. Several national parks are available in the country which have also played the role of beautification. I frequently visit the Georgian Bay Islands National Park and this is my favourite park.\n\nThe Georgian Bay Islands National Park is an archipelago and made of 63 islands. It is located in Ontario in the Georgian Bay. The entire area covers an area of over 13 square kilometres. Earlier it was attached to another island but now this is completely a different one. The natural views are charming and the visitors have numerous options to pass their leisure hours. This is mostly formed with lots of pines and rocks. Some of the hardwood forests are also available here. Despite the exceptional facilities, the visitors are to pre-book the venue if they want to pass time in this park.      \n\nThe Georgian Bay Islands National Park is a two-hour journey from my city, Toronto. But the Georgian Bay Islands National Park is accessible by boat only. Since this is the combinations of a good number of islands, there are no other transportation mode except boat if you want to visit the park completely. So, it is a good place for people having their own boats. Besides, ordinary visitors can take a ride on the water taxi to reach the park and get engaged in the entertaining activities. The water taxi is available from the Honey Harbour road. Besides, the visitors with their own boats can also visit there and can dock their boats safe and sound in different locations.\n\nIt needs some preparations to visit the park. So, it is not possible for me to visit the park frequently. Generally, I visit it once or twice in a month and pass the entire day with thrilling activities. Moreover, the locality is inhospitable. So, I need to take some other precautionary measures before starting the journey like taking foods and water, necessary medicines, extra clothes etc. Visiting the park and observing nature is my hobby, but often I take part in some other activities as well. There are over 30 species of reptiles and amphibians are available. The islands are their nesting areas. But I keep a distance from those areas and keep myself busy with other adventurous activities.  \n\nThe Georgian Bay Islands National Park is my favourite park for some special reasons. First of all, this is the largest freshwater archipelago in the world. Mother nature is preserved here with care. A large number of pines are available here while the granite shores, dense forests etc. are adorable. The park allows taking part in different adventurous activities like camping at night, camping in a group, cycling, riding on a canoe, fishing in the lakes, walking on the trails and hiking and more others. This is also a great location for the picnic while many of the professional photographers come here for their photography needs. Swimming in the lakes is one of my preferred tasks. Whenever I can manage the time I do not miss swimming in the freshwater lakes. Considering all the features, this is my favourite park in Canada."

    "Answer": "As a citizen of the United States of America, I am aware of some excellent laws which ensure social justice, human rights, prevent influential people to use their power and make the USA one of the safest countries in the world. ‘Fair Housing Act’ is a law that I think is quite a significant and excellent law and for this cue card topic, I would like to talk about it.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act was first adopted in 1968 and it has gone through several amendments up until now. This law was implemented to ensure fair housing policy and to eliminate the discrimination on rent or sell for any property in the USA. The legislation was in place to make it illegal for anyone to refuse to sell, rent or make housing available to someone based on their race, colour, sex, religion, country of origin, family status, or handicap. The Fair Housing Act also protects citizens in mortgage landing circumstances, making it illegal for anyone to discriminate when appraising property or require different fees or contacts of someone just because of their race, colour, national origin or religion.\n\nI first learned about this law from an assignment one of our teachers gave us during our second term in the college. We were supposed to complete a lengthy and thorough assignment on housing rent discrimination in Michigan state. As part of the assignment, I had to study the acts and laws related to housing rent and property sell. Later on, I read a newspaper editorial that explained some unfairness on renting houses in the USA and how laws prohibit it.\n\nI think most of the people believe that this is a vital law in place to reduce racism and social prejudice. For some people, it is quite a life-saving law. Most of my friends think that this is quite an important law in place.\n\nI personally believe that this law protects thousands of US citizens to be unfairly treated while renting or purchasing a property. This act ensures the equal rights of the US citizens and maintains the social just. Laws are meant to establish the fact that all human beings are equal and they should never be discriminated due to their economic conditions, sex, race, social status, country of origin, religion colour, and this law I am talking about perfectly reflects this important issue and makes housing rules fair. Without this law, there would have been widespread discrimination on property renting and selling. Doubtlessly this is one of the most important laws in our country."

    "Answer": "I think all laws are good because they all are aimed to bring good for a country and its citizens except, of course, some “unruly” and “pathological law violators” would always try to disregard them at the expense of greater benefits. Anyway, today, I would like talk about one such good law which was introduced and passed in our parliament in the year of 2016 in order to effectively deal with the systematic challenges which are plaguing the road transport sector in India.\n\nThe name of the bill is the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill 2016 which I first came to know about in July 2016. This bill has a number of provisions which include a hefty increase in the fines for traffic rules violators, cancelling the registration of motor vehicles, sending unruly drivers to jail, and improving services for the disabled people because of suffering fatal injuries in road accidents. For example, driving with a disqualified license, which attracted a penalty of Rs 500 before, will now cost the violators Rs 10,000, thanks to the new Motor Vehicle Amendment Bill 2016. Finally, with the help of new law, e-governance services will improve so that the drivers can get learning licenses online and increase the validity period of their drivers’ licenses. The common people are really happy about this law, and they expect the provisions of this law to be enforced strictly.\n\nIn my opinion, it is a very good law primarily because it will go a long way to address the horrible situation in Indian roads and highways where accidents kill about 17 people every hour. Besides, this law will allow the drivers to receive their learners’ licenses and increase their validity periods easily and quickly online. Finally, this law is a good law also because it will provide some much-needed comforts and hope for the “disabled” people by providing them better services."

    "Answer": "Smoking is undoubtedly a bad habit with numerous detrimental impacts on smokers and on society as a whole. Not a single benefit of smoking could be found until today and so the government of Australia has become rigid on the issue of smoking here and there. I welcome a law that bans smoking in public places and which ensures that cigarettes are sold in plain packets.\n\nBesides, the government has also initiated plain packaging for tobacco products. It points out that all the tobacco products should be sold in a generic packet. There should be no advertisements for tobacco products on the packets. And all the brands will have the same colour in their pack. Any sort of imagery or branding is banned after the recent law that came into force in 2012. However, the brand name of the cigarette brand should be placed in a preset font and on a specific part of the packet. The health warning should be mentioned clearly. The plain packaging system is also introduced in some other states but Australia is the leading one in the case.  \n\nWhen the stringent anti-smoking law came into force, it was publicised on mainstream media. I came to know about the issue from the mass media reports and other publications. Moreover, there were some silent moves by the tobacco companies and they tried to stop the process of plain packaging. But they were a failure. Despite the barriers from the tobacco companies, the government implemented the law and made it a must for them to sell cigarettes in plain packets. Disobeying the law is subject to severe punishment in terms of monetary fine and sentence for imprisonment.\n\nPeople across the country and islands are highly satisfied with the anti-smoking law provisions. In fact, it was troublesome to tolerate cigarette smoke in public transports and places like bus stoppages, medical centres, theatres, schools, colleges, shopping malls and other public places. This was a big problem for the non-smokers to comply with the cigarette smoke. As a result, the number of health disorders was on the rise. But with the initiation of the new anti-tobacco law, now the non-smokers are relieved to a great extent. The rate of smoking in public places has reduced to a great extent. Besides, there is a decline in cigarette sell as well. So, it appears that people have accepted the law gladly and abiding it as much as they can.   \n\nThis is really a good law for the state. Smoking is detrimental both for the smokers and the non-smokers. Besides, smoking cigarettes is also harmful to the environment. The attempt from the government to stop the use of tobacco is really appreciating. It is anticipated that someday the use of tobacco will come down to a great extent and that is the expectation from everyone."

    "Answer": "Saving money is not an easy thing to do, but we all know and understand how important it really is to save up money to live a respectable life, as well as to secure the future of our families and ourselves. Of course, while people have their own ways of saving money, I have my own which I would like to discuss here.\n\nTalking about my method, I try to buy everything, from groceries to flight tickets and from gift-items to vitamin supplements, on discounts as often as possible. Of course, this particular method can be a bit tricky to stick with because it is not always easy to keep track of the original prices of different kinds of products and commodities unless you set some “time” aside from your daily schedule in order the check the prices of different products at different grocery stores and outlets in the town on a regular basis. Besides, in order to become a successful “money saver” by using my method, one also would need to be a bit knowledgeable about different seasons or times when a particular type of “produce”,  especially the vegetables and fruits, is available in abundance and are sold at a lower price. Finally, I also try to keep track of different “special occasions” and “holidays” when the stores usually declare “discounts” on different kinds of products and merchandises so that I can avail such opportunities as much as I can.\n\nI have been following this method for almost a decade in order to save up some money, and I believe that a significant number of people do the same.  \n\nI think that my method is a pretty effective way because it allows me to be flexible in practising a “better” judgment when buying anything. In other words, I don’t allow a certain producer or seller to “exploit” me at will because I happen to favour a certain brand of product over the others. Besides, this particular method allows me to try different kinds of products with different kinds of taste and appeal without spending any extra money."

    "Answer": "Interesting topic indeed and I thank you for the chance to let me talk about a method or way I personally apply to save money. Well, I use a personal accounting application on my mobile phone and enter my earnings and expenditures on a daily basis. This method helps me track down the unnecessary expenses, alert me whenever my expenditure goes beyond a certain limit and eventually help me save money out of my monthly earnings.\n\nI use an \"accounting software\" on my smartphone for the purpose. It is quite intuitive and easy to use and does not require someone to know the basics of accounting. This is comparatively a small application and does not require a huge resource, unlike many smartphone applications. I have been using this Android mobile application for the last 2 years. I have found it a very handy application that enables me to enter my earnings, expenses, shows various comprehensive reports and possible areas where I can expense less and save money. For instance, at the end of a month, I noticed that I have spent more than 700 dollars on taxi fare and that was quite alarming. I would never have noticed that without this application and from the next month I have devised other plans to reduce my monthly transportation costs.\n\nI am not sure if this application is widely used or not, but using some sort of personal accounting software, mobile applications or using a notebook to tally the earning and expenses is rather a common method. I had my doubt initially whether I would be benefitted from this method. But after a few months, I started realising that it was helping me immensely. As a salaried employee, my earning remains almost the same in each month but the expenses vary to a great extent. Interestingly I knew the mandatory areas or my monthly expenses before I started using this application but after I started using it, my perception of the areas of expenses totally changed. I had no idea there were so many areas of my expenses and the possible ways to save some money weekly by following some simple steps. This application helped me tremendously and I have to thank the developer of this application who made it totally free to download and use.\n\nAdjusting the daily expenses on the application was kind of boring at the beginning, but within a few weeks, I made it a daily habit. Since this method is helping me to save money, I consider it an important task at the end of the day. This application even has reminder options for different events and occasions of my friends and family members. For instance, at the beginning of a month, the application shows me the birthdays or similar events that are going to take place this month. The reminder also shows me the possible amount I can spend on gifts without crossing my monthly budget.  The most amazing feature of this application is its ability to compare products I regularly purchase or intend to purchase and notify me of the best price and special deals. I personally find it very handy as the shopping comparison is done by my application and saves both time and money for me."

    "Answer": "As an undergrad student, I have no major earnings, rather I take my pocket money from my dad. So, I save money from what I get to fill up my special hobbies or to buy something that I need to. To save money, I note down each of my expenses.\n\nFrom my early childhood, I have noticed that if the expenses could be tracked down, the level of the cost could be reduced to some extent. There are many ways to control costs and they are useful as well. But saving money from the small amount you get is really difficult. However, this has proved an effective technique for me. Whenever I made any expense, I note that down on a small notebook to track it. In fact, I have a daily budget and to save money I try to figure out the expenses I made on a day. When I look at the list, I get the entire scenario of previous expenses and accordingly plan for expense on that day.\n\nI have been following the method since I was in seventh grade. Dad taught me the way. Actually, he followed the method in his early life. He suggested me noting down all the expenses I made in a day. At the end of the day, I sum up the expense and get a clear account if the expense is more or less than the daily allocated budget. When the expenses are more, I try to spend less on the next day to bring a balance. By the same time, I try to save a portion from the daily allocation. Since I have been following the method for around six years, it proved effective to me. And I am able to save a substantial amount of bucks from my daily fund.\n\nThis is a common method though not popular at all. It requires carrying a pencil and a notebook always. Often it is troublesome to write down the expense in a notebook and it is difficult especially when you are in the market and hands are filled with goods. Further, it is quite natural that people may forget about the expenses they made on the day when they are to count all the expenses at night. In fact, it often becomes impossible to take the note instantly in places. If the note is taken later, there are huge chances to forget some of the transactions that you have made. Hence, usually, people do not prefer to write down their expenses and use some alternatives.  \n\nThe way appears effective for me. It helps to save my money. When I note the costs and their segments, a clear sense is developed. I can track the costs and control them. As the expense segments are in written format, I get the idea about how much I need to spend on them. So, I make a division of my pocket money and save a portion which remains unused. Before making every single expense, I analyse my financial condition and cut the unnecessary costs. As a result, I can save a smart amount of money per week. This is, in fact, a boring task, I get some special benefits following it. It really helps me break down my expenses and prevents unnecessary costs. Thus I can save money and spend them later for meeting different hobbies and necessities of mine."

    "Answer": "I like all kinds of birds simply because they have the ability to spread their wings at will and live right now, this moment, by getting lost in the big and blue sky without having anything to worry about. Of course, it would be great if I could talk about all of them here, but I just wouldn’t be allowed enough time for it, so I would just talk about a “peacock” – the bird which I just adore – instead.\n\nNot sure where to start, when trying to describe a peacock, but describing this beautiful bird is not like describing any other birds in the kingdom of other two-legged creatures because they are just so “majestic” in their looks. However, if we want to describe them in simple words, we could say that they are “perfectly” large in size with colourful pheasants (typically blue and green), and they are famously known for their “distinctive” tails with lustrous colours like those of the beautiful rainbow. In fact, their tails spread out in such a distinctive train that they are easily measured as more than 50/60 per cent of their total body length, with colourful “eye” marks all over it which are usually blue, gold, red, and other hues. The large train, used in mating rituals and courtship displays, is arched into a magnificent fan, which reaches across the bird's back, while also touching the ground on either side. By the way, it should be also mentioned here that even though peacock is my favourite bird, it is not commonly seen in my country.\n\nAnyway, the peacock is my favourite bird primarily because it has such a stunningly unique and beautiful look. Not only that but also, they display a spectacular dance in order to attract the female “peahen”. These beautiful creatures also make a melodious sound to call others during the sunrise and the sunset, the fact, which is unique to them only. Finally, it is one of my favourites because they symbolize “eternal love” as when they pair with a mate, they are always loyal and faithful to their partners."

    "Answer": "I love birds and I am very fond of parrots. Due to the beautiful colours, sweet vocals and friendly characteristics, the parrot is my favourite bird. \n\nParrots are also known as psittacines and the main characteristic features of parrots include a strong curved bill, strong legs, their vivid colours, an upright stance and clawed zygodactyls feet. Some parrots are multicoloured and very intelligent. This bird has roughly 393 species and some species have a distinctive ability to imitate human voices. Those birds are very popular as pets. \n \nYes, parrots are common in our country and according to a survey we have more than 38 species of this bird in our country. It is very unfortunate that these birds are often subject to more exploitation than other groups of birds.  Parrots mostly eat seeds, fruits, buds, pollens, nectars and sometimes arthropods and other animal prey. Some parrots including macaws and cockatoos have long a lifespan. \n \nIn my early childhood, I visited a bird’s park with my parents and parrots enchanted me with their varying length, beautiful colours and on top of that their ability to mimic my voice. I was so fascinated with these birds that my parents had to take me to this bird’s park a few more times. I guess my fascination for parrots in my childhood turned out to make this species my favourite bird. Up until then, I have never seen any other birds or animals could mimic human voices. \n \nIn my early school days, my parents bought me two parrots and I spent many hours watching their activities and talking to them. These two birds could tell my name and many other words and that brought me closer to them. With time, I started to like them even more. When I turned to 9, my grandmother told me some stories about the encaged birds and how inhuman it is to put them in a cage when they like to fly in the open space. She also told me that it is a sin to confine the birds for our personal entertainment. Luckily I was touched by her lessons and stories and in a few days, I released them. Now I feel somewhat proud of this event and the parrot will always be my favourite bird."

    "Answer": "Shy Albatross is one of the most available birds in Australia. This is the bird that has undergone several changes in its category and known in different names. I like it most than any other birds for some reasons.\n\nShy Albatross is a medium-sized bird that is also known as Shy Mollymawk. Earlier, there were some confusions over the classification of this bird. After a number of research and argumentations, bird specialists have reached the decision that Shy Albatross belongs to Thalasarche species. It was shifted from its former class – Diomedea. In the beginning, everyone thought that this one belongs to Salvin’s albatross but observing some changes in its behaviours and types, the species class was changed finally. Now the bird is available on three Australian islands. The bird is also known as the white-capped albatross.\n\nShy Albatross is the bird that has a different look in the size and shape of the albatross family. Usually, a Shy Albatross is 35 inches in length while its wingspan is around 100 inches. It looks a healthy bird for its weight that ranges around 4 kilogrammes. The bird is largest in its species and comes with different colours including white, slate-grey and black. The underwing contains a black thumb marking which has made it attractive while flying. Moreover, the matured Shy Albatross comes with a white forehead accompanied by a crown. The face is pale grey. Some of the body parts are grey-black while the rest of the body is white in colour. Shy Albatross has a grey-yellow beak as well. As a result, the bird has got a gorgeous look.\n\nShy Albatross is a common bird in my country. But somehow it is getting endangered and within the next few days, it may turn into a vulnerable species. Basically climatic changes, loss of their habitat for causes created by men, wild animals etc. are the key reasons behind its vulnerability. To preserve the Shy Albatross, initiatives have been adopted and the research is still underway. Once it was available in almost all the islands of Australia but now the breeding of the bird has declined to a notable extent. Survival for the birds is becoming difficult. Now the birds are available on Albatross Island, Mewstone and Pedra Branca.    \n\nI like the bird very much for its special nature and looks. Shy Albatross is not a hunting bird but it can participate in pursuit to feed itself. The bird mostly takes fish, tunicates and cephalopods etc. Its breeding is also interesting. Almost all the birds breed in some calm atmosphere but it breeds on rocky islands. The bird is able to make its nest nicely. The nest is made of grass, roots, and soil collected from different places. The child birds have an unbelievable skill of flying. They are able to fly even to South Africa at a stretch. Shy Albatross is able to produce stomach oil which helps them to fly a long distance or to create a food source for their chicks. Sometimes they use it to protect themselves as well. For all such reasons, Shy Albatross has become my preferred bird."

    "Answer": "Different people have different preferences as far as their favourite parts of the day are concerned. Some prefer early morning, while the others like afternoon, and I am sure that they all have their reasons for their preferences just as I do. But, my favourite part of the day is “night”.\n\nNow, please don’t think that just because the night is my favourite part of the day, I don’t like other parts of the day, or I try to overlook their importance. In fact, I believe that both day and night are equally important to maintain a balance in this entire world. But, the night certainly has a different appeal to me as far its occasional silence, the gentle breeze, the moonlight, the bright and beautiful stars in the sky is concerned.  \n\nBesides, it is at night time which allows me to spend some quality time with my family and friends while watching some good TV programmes and movies with them. By the way, apart from hanging out with my family at night time and watch some TV, I also like to go out a little and walk in the street in order to see what really is happening in and around my neighbourhood. Sometimes, I also like to read some interesting books at night before falling asleep.  Anyway, this night time is different for me from the other parts of the day because it provides me clarity of mind.\n\nAnyway, night time is my favourite part of the day, primarily because it allows me to recuperate from the fatigue and tiredness of a busy workday. Besides, it also allows me to enjoy some quality time with my family which is not possible during the day time. It is during the night time, I feel like God is revealing some of His mysteries to by letting us watch the beautiful sky which is lit with a bright moon and countless numbers of stars.  Finally, the night is my favourite part of the day because it actually allows me to prepare me, both physically and mentally, for the next day."

    "Answer": "This is an interesting topic and I thank you for letting me talk about my favourite part of the day. Well, I am an early riser and the early morning is my favourite time of the day. \n\nI usually wake up at 5:30 am and start the day with a cup of tea. I brush my teeth and change my dress. Then I go to the gym and exercise for about 40-45 minutes. After that, I take a hot shower. I then water the plants I have in my verandah and at around 7:00 am I read the daily newspaper and eat my breakfast. At around 7:40 am I look at my ‘to-do’ list that I prepare the night before and finalise my tasks for the day. At 8:30 am I dress up and leave home to reach the office. (… If you are a student, say that you leave home to attend your class…)\n\nThe early morning is somewhat different than the other parts of the day. It is quiet, refreshing and allows me to plan for the remaining day. The night-sleep revives me in the morning and I find it very pleasant to start doing something challenging. This is the ideal time to exercise, eat a nice and light meal, think about important issues, and plan for the whole day.\n\nFor me, early morning is the most important and pleasant part as I can enjoy it in complete peace and serenity. The tranquillity of the surroundings, soothing temperature, refreshing shower, and the promise of starting a great day make it worth enjoying. It is said that the morning shows the day and I totally agree with this adage. If I can keep away my tensions and start the morning the way I expect it to be, the whole day becomes fruitful and enjoyable. On top of that, I can recall several occasions in the early morning when I had been able to solve many complex problems. For instance, on one occasion I tried to solve an algorithm for a couple of days but the solution popped up in my mind in one morning, when I was having my tea. This is probably because I am a regular early riser and my mind remains spanking new at that time. I would like to say that early rising is also advantageous for our physical and mental health. I can make important decisions mostly in the morning as I can think logically at a quiet time. I guess this tells pretty much everything I like about this part of the day."

    "Answer": "A day is the collection of hours, minutes and seconds. In fact, human life is the summation of some such precious moments. So, I enjoy every second of my life but prefer to sit back and enjoy the dusk more than anything.  \n\nEveryone might have some special moments in their life but I enjoy my special moments every day. Dusk! I like dusk the most for some of its attractive features. This is the time when the day ends and night falls in the world. The moment is enriched with blessings. Transformation of daylight into darkness is the key attraction of the moment. The entire world turns silent and reminds us of nature, its magnificent features and beauty. It also suggests that those all were created by the Almighty, and we are blessed to be alive. We are unable to stop the transition of time. We even cannot delay the process for a single second. It goes on, naturally.  \n\nThere are many things to do for me at dusk. In fact, I am alone at this moment, my parents and siblings are out of the home. So, I have chances to do whatever I want. Usually, I move to the rooftop and sit there idly. We live in an 18-storied apartment in Jakarta. So, the sky view of the city turns magnificent. The red shades in the sky, flying birds, setting sun etc. all create a heavenly environment at that moment. I enjoy them all. Moreover, sometimes I take a mug of coffee with me while passing this time. Reading poetry is another activity for me if I am at home. It mostly happens when my parents return from their offices early, and then they disallow me moving to the rooftop in the dusk.   \n\nDusk is completely different from the other parts of the day. The day begins with the sunrise and ends with the sunset. The dusk is the moment right before the sunset and so I wait for this part round the day. The environment is calm at this time. In other times of the day, there are lots of noise and chaos around and they continue till the night. But with some magical events, dusk becomes quite. Everyone seems to behave differently at this time. When dusk appears, I think a sense of serenity spreads everywhere. So, the moments become different and have a pleasant type of feeling. A sense of peacefulness comes upon me and I forget the tiredness of the day when I walk on the rooftop during dusk.\n\nAs an undergraduate student, it is really difficult to manage time for leisure. In fact, I have to remain busy round the day with my academic activities. I return home by noon and complete the assignments and projects. The time I get only for me is evening. But often I have to pass the evening at home with family members. When they are not at home, I can manage the key to moving to the rooftop which remains locked always. Gazing at the open sky creates a mysterious feeling inside me. Nature takes a beautiful look around. Moreover, having a cup of coffee increases the joy of the moments. So, dusk has become the most preferred part of a day for me."

    "Answer": "Well, there is no doubt that Australia, my home country, is one of the most beautiful countries in the world, not only because of its stunning green environment and landscape but also because of its unique animals in its animal kingdom. And, today I would like to talk about one such unique and interesting animal.\n\nThis animal is called “Koala”.  Also known as “Koala Bear”, this Australian “native bear” lives in the east coast and the southern region of Australia. This cuddly animal usually has brownish or grey fur. They also have white furs on certain parts of their bodies as well, like on their chest, legs, ears and neck.  These beautiful animals are well-known for their large round head, big furry ears and big black nose (with no fur). Having an average length of 67 to 82 centimetres and weight of about 6.5 kilograms to 12 kilograms, these adult koala bears can eat between 200 to 500 grams of leaves each day.\n\nBy the way, their main food is eucalyptus leaves even though, they may occasionally eat leaves from other native Australian trees as well. They don’t only eat the leaves of eucalyptus trees, but they also live in these trees. Koalas are largely sedentary animals (meaning they are kind of “lazy” and don’t really like to get involved in any kind of physical activities. So, that would naturally mean that they sleep too much. In fact, they can sleep up to 20 hours a day. Anyway, these beautiful and cuddly, but mostly asocial animals for the most part and with no tails, are not really that common in Australia since they live in only selected areas of Australia.\n\nAnyway, I find Koalas really interesting, primarily because they look cute, and they look even cuter when they are terrified. Another intriguing fact about these kolas is that even though they look “lazy”, they can break into a gallop, moving at speeds of up to 30 kilometres (or 18 miles) per hour if necessary. Besides, very few animals in this world have such a strong sense of touch and smell like the baby koalas."

    "Answer": "Bottlenose dolphins are quite interesting and for this candidate task card, I would like to talk about this animal. They have got their name due to the shape of their beak but interestingly they cannot smell! However, they have outstanding eyesight and hearing ability.\n\nDolphins are mammals like the human and they need to breathe air, unlike many other fishes and animals that live in the water. They breathe through the blowholes they have. Bottlenose dolphins usually live in groups.\n\nDolphins are not common in our country. They usually live in tropical waters and that ranges from Northern Japan to Australia and from Southern California to Chile. They are also found in the Indian Ocean from Indonesia to South Africa, Norway, Mexico, Mediterranean sea, black sea and the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nFrom their appearance to distinctive features the are quite interesting. Their physiology and senses, intelligence level, relation to the human, history and their migration style make them a very unique and interesting animal.\n\nDolphins often work as a team to harvest fishes and they search for prey mainly using echolocation. They emit sounds, mainly clicking, and wait to listen to the return echoes to determine the location and shape of nearby items including potential prey. They have a high intelligence level and they use an artificial language which is quite remarkable for an animal. An adult bottlenose dolphin can live more than40 years and can jump up to 20 feet in the air. They jump in the air to communicate with other dolphins. The use of body language by the bottlenose dolphins is quite fascinating and it is being studied by many researchers. A study explains that mother dolphins teach the behavioural patterns to their offspring and this is another interesting fact about dolphins. Large sharks sometimes prey on the bottlenose dolphins, especially calves and the Dolphins also have the capability of defending them by charging the predators. It is very interesting to observe that some dolphins show curiosity towards humans.\n\nI wish we have bottlenose dolphins in our country! Once I have been to Australia and spent hours in a waterpark where I saw dolphins for the first time in my life. After that, I did some online research to learn more about them. This is one of the most intelligent animals with many unique features and they are bound to draw our attention and curiosity."

    "Answer": "In Australia, Kangaroos are found widespread. They are available across the country and most of the times they are seen in the farmlands.  \n\nKangaroo is a special type of animal for the country and comes with some special features. They belong to large foot-species. Despite being four-footed animals, they feel comfortable to use their legs to walk or run. They love to live in families and extremely cares for their kids and other family members. In fact, they are the largest marsupials living in the world and found in four different types – eastern grey kangaroo, western grey kangaroo, red kangaroo and antilopine kangaroo. Though they are of different categories, all of them have a magnificent look.  \n\nKangaroo has some noteworthy features. The most impressive feature is its walking, I believe. It can walk and jump like humans and in some cases, they are too fast than humans. Kangaroos are herbivorous animals. So, they completely rely on grasses. Besides, another feature of kangaroos is that they are able to pass long hours without drinking water. Interestingly, they are unable to move speedily with their four legs rather they are comfortable with their two legs. Kangaroos are unable to walk back which is another impressive aspect. However, Kangaroos may turn dangerous if they are attacked by humans or other animals. But ordinarily, they are cool enough and makes a friendly relation with humans.\n\nYes, Kangaroo is a common animal in Australia. In fact, this unofficially the national animal for us. The symbol of Kangaroo is found in almost everywhere and even it is present as an emblem on the coat of arms in Australia. Some of the national currencies also contain the Kangaroo symbol. Because of its availability everywhere, the animal has become a part of the national culture in Australia. Even some of the defence forces and the airline also use the symbol of Kangaroo with them. Besides, this is useful for the economy as well. Wild Kangaroos produce leather and other necessary materials for us. In some points, there are arguments that the meat produced from Kangaroo has some health benefits. So, the meat is also consumed frequently in line with the traditional meats.  \n\nKangaroos appear interesting to me for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they can jump to a height crossing their own length. For instance, if a Kangaroo is of 6 feet height, it can jump around 18 feet at a time. This happens for the strong legs. Besides, they are able to swim. I have seen some Kangaroos swimming which appeared interesting to me. Many of the wild animals are unable to swim and Kangaroos are their opposite in this matter. Though most of the Kangaroos live on grass, some are habituated in taking different types of foods other than grass. They love to spend time together in organised groups while their groups are known as ‘mob’."

But, that doesn’t necessarily mean that I don’t like to laugh when a good joke is told to me.\n\nThe joke, I am going to talk about, was told me to me by one of my good friends about a few weeks ago. By this friend of mine has a reputation of cracking some of the funniest jokes, even on his worst days, which could probably awaken a dead person also!\n\nOf course, the problem is he doesn’t always tell jokes. In fact, we actually have to bribe him sometimes to listen to some of his funniest jokes. So, the other day, when my joke-telling friend and a couple of other friends were sitting at a restaurant and enjoying some great foods, my “entertainer” friend decide to open up and tell us a joke. And the joke was about a serial thief who stole 19 times at the house of the same person. His marathon stealing act had gone on for almost 6 months until he was finally caught one day.\n\nNaturally, the thief was taken to the court for a fair trial. The Judge of the court asked the thief if he was actually the thief, and the thief confessed about his crime. Finally, before announcing his verdict, the judge curiously asked the thief as to why he (the thief) chose to steal 19 times at the same house.  In response, the thief said that just like every family has a “family doctor” or a “family teacher’, I also was a “family thief” of that home. Not to mention, as soon as we heard the phrase “family thief”, we all burst out in laughter.\n\nAnyway, the joke was interesting because even though the thief could have stolen at other houses and gained, even more, he didn’t do so, and instead he chose to steal at the same house, apparently because he wasn’t such a greedy thief after all!"

    "Answer": "My recent meet with my college buddies was great fun. We gathered after a long time near the Sydney Opera House and discussed different topics. At the gathering, there was a writer who cracked a joke over the current political conditions. We all laughed.\n\nThe joke was about a thief and his selection as a cabinet member in a fictional state. One day the police caught a thief red-handed. The thief was produced at the court. But the thief disagreed to be trialled on the court with excuses that the judge is dishonest. The issue was covered in the mainstream media. So, the issue was raised at the cabinet with the presence of the thief. The Premier asked the Home Minister to run the trial, but the minister denied saying that he is imperfect and often becomes corrupt. So, it was shifted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs - he also denied running the trial with the same reason of discrepancy on different issues. Almost all the ministers were asked to run the trial but all of the refuted with a similar reason. When finally the trial was shifted to the Premier, he also denied that saying that he is to run a state and he also needs to be corrupt sometimes. Suddenly, someone from the cabinet proposed to enlist him in the cabinet saying this will end the troubles.     \n\nSamuel is one of my close buddies. He loves to think critically about society. Now he is an established writer cum journalist and writes fictions for a newspaper. Besides, he also writes as a freelance writer for some other agencies as well. I met him first at my college here in Australia. He joined us in the middle of the year. In fact, he was late for attending the classes though enrolled at the beginning of the year. He was troubled with visa processing at that time as he is non-native in Australia. However, after his joining, it appeared that our class was revived. He was smart and still he is. With his innovative speeches and activities, he made the classes fun and even the teachers also liked him for his witty questions and wise responses.        \n\nWe all present at the gathering laughed. In fact, it really was interesting for us and too funny. The reasons behind the joke were extremely positive. Actually, the reason of the thief for not being tried by any dishonest judge or public representative was amusing. Initially, the joke appeared quite interesting and we all laughed. We all laughed at the joke by our heart. Some of us started imitating like the thief – only to extend the fun.\n\nThe joke was really an interesting one for some reasons. In fact, the thief was correct in some sense. He did not want to be trialled with someone who is corrupt like him. He wanted to be trialled by someone who was honest so that he could get the right verdict for his misdeeds. But there was not an honest individual who could play the role of the judge to solve the issue. So, someone from the cabinet proposed to make him a minister and this will reduce the trial dilemma. Though the place and the characters are fictional, this is a common issue for almost all of the countries. Corruption is prevailing everywhere. We are accustomed to it but this joke was a type of blow against corruption."

Of course, so far, I have managed to have such car trips only to a few places, but today, I would like to talk about a car trip which I am really looking forward to.\n\nI want to take this car trip from my Hanoi (my home town) to Halong Bay which is about a 170 kilometres journey. Now, I must say that I have never taken such a long car trip before, so it is going to become equally challenging as well as thrilling.\n\nOf course, I wouldn’t take that car trip alone since travelling alone is no fun. On that occasion, I would not take a public bus since I will rent a car for this trip. So, I would take a couple of friends with me, who are not only good drivers, but also they have already taken a road trip to Hanlong Bay a couple of times, and it is them who actually have convinced me to take this car trip.\n\nAnyway, before I hit the road, I am planning to buy a road map so that I know what my itineraries are exactly going to be.  By the way, I would take Haiphong Expressway for my car trip as it would cut the drive from Hanoi to Halong Bay from four hours to little more than two. Of course, I would need to pay some toll money to ride on this highway, but it is certainly worth the cost since it would allow me to have a speedier and shorter drive from Hanoi to Halong Bay.\n\nWell, I want to take this trip to Halong Bay by a car because I have never really driven on a highway for a long. Besides, this car trip would allow me the flexibility to travel to places of our choices at our own pace. I want to travel to that place in a car also because it would allow us to reach our destination quicker and take breaks on the highway whenever we want."

I want a trip in a car with them.\n\nLas Vegas is most famous for the colourful nightlife. This is a resort town located in the Mojave Desert in Nevada. The town has some specialities and during the night times, it looks best. The entire city is well decorated and illuminated. The most amazing feature of the city is the musical fountain. It is synchronised with music. Besides, the Strip is also another attractive issue at the town. The replicas like Eiffel Tower, Egyptian Pyramids etc. are also some adorable things here. The city is around 125 kilometres away from my town, Bullhead City in Arizona.\n\nRecently my buddy David has got a brand new car on his 19th birthday. But he is unable to drive the car since his dad is not allowing him to move with the car until the college exams are done. Thereby, he is planning to make a trip in his car. Hence I want to go there in David’s car. In fact, I have my own motorbike but my parents are highly anxious about my rough and tough driving. They have become more cautious after my last accident when I broke my knee. I am under a kind of restriction on driving. So, I am unable to move for the trip and if I had the chances, I would have moved alone. Alas! I have no other way to wait until the exams are over. David has also turned crazy like me make the tour.  \n\nI am a student at Everest College and I am doing my undergrad course in economics. I have a group of six members of the college. We love to be together always like having a group study, moving to a theatre, joining at any ceremony and more. Sometimes we make some short trips in some less distant areas. Now we are planning to have a trip to Las Vegas. Though I went there for several times with my dad to meet my uncle who owns a small pub there, I did not have the chance to move on my own. Dad always was with me lest I get into any bar or pub and have a drink. In fact, my parents are conservative in some aspects.\n\nI would like to go there by car because it is a long journey. Las Vegas is around 125 kilometres away from my home. Moving such a distance alone is not preferable to me. Moreover, if I become a victim of an accident, there is none to look after me on the highway to Vegas. Even there are some risks to move alone in the city until you are matured enough to protect yourself from any sudden invasion. Considering all the issues, I have decided to make the trip with my friends and moreover, it would be great fun for us. All of us have visited the town but we lack the experience to stay at night there. So, I am going there on the car that will be driven by David."

    "Answer": "Well, I have no hesitation to admit that I make a lot of mistakes. While some of these mistakes don’t really affect us that negatively, the others harm very dearly just like the mistake I made in my high school years about 15 years ago when I studied and prepared for the wrong subject. Sounds pretty stupid, doesn’t it?\n\nBut, then again, when you are in high school and young, I guess that being stupid is allowed. However, the problem was that I was probably a bit more stupid than the other boys of my age. And, that’s probably why I seldom cared to write down the schedules for the test as a high school student.\n\nOf course, such carelessness and stupidity of mine didn’t exactly cause much of a problem with my studies or test preparation since I could memorize them all by heart. But, that just didn’t happen unfortunately when I was a 9th-grade student and was preparing for my half-yearly test for the geography class. By the way, I was never really a good geography student, so I had to spend a great deal of extra time studying it in order to get some respectable score on it.\n\nBut, when I took my seat in the class and got the test paper in my hands, I couldn’t really believe my own eyes as the test paper, which I was looking at, was actually a test paper of social science. For a minute, I thought that the test supervisor must have made a mistake in picking up the right test papers from his office, but when I asked him about it, he told me in a very authoritative voice that it was I who had made the mistake. The supervisor was right.\n\nAnyway, the mistake affected me really badly, primarily because I couldn’t answer the test questions properly, which also meant that I ended up getting a very poor score in my social science exam. But, the good thing was I finally learned my lesson because of this terrible mistake and started to write down all test schedules thereafter."

    "Answer": "No one wants to talk about his mistakes and it seems like the human psychology is prone to forget blunders and remember good things in life. But some mistakes are hard to forget and have severe consequences in life. I, too, as an ordinary human try to learn from my mistakes, forget them most of the time and go ahead with my dreams to do something remarkable in my life. I would like to thank you for this cue card topic that expects me to talk about a mistake I have made in my life.\n\nThe biggest mistake in my life was falling in love with the wrong girl who had a completely different view of life, love and relationship. I was hardly 17 years old when I fall hard for this girl.\n\nInitially, we were classmates and then became friends. In a year I started to feel something about her that was quite extraordinary and hard to explain. I guess people call this 'love'. My whole world started to shift and I was surrounded by a mirage for this whole time. Not a single moment had passed when I didn't think about her. She was the centre and power source of my universe. When I proposed her, she expressed her boundless joys and acted as if I should have proposed her earlier. So far, this is a sweet and innocent love story of a teenager and I was happy to have her in my life.\n\nHowever, it took me only a few months to realise that she was not serious about our relationship. When she was my whole world, I was her just another temporary boyfriend. The relationship ended in ten months and I was so broken-hearted that I could not concentrate on anything for a while. My parents also knew about it and they were very supportive of me. First few days, it was quite difficult for me to get back to my normal life, study or go outside. I simply could not appease my mind that I made a great mistake and it was like an illusion that I need to come out from soon. However, when I started realising that I made a big mistake by approaching a serious relationship without even knowing the girl genuinely, I started making peace with my mind. I was completely honest with myself and that eventually helped me to get out of the depressive time I went through at that time.\n\nThe lesson learned from this mistake made me more cautious about making any kind of relationship and I am happy that I took this mistake as an event to learn a lesson. However, I often feel bad that how someone could be so naive to play with someone's sentiment so cheaply."

    "Answer": "Making a mistake is quite natural for human beings. In fact, everyone makes mistakes. I also did so, recently while preparing for cooking. I set fire at home by mistake and got injured.\n\nI live in Pakistan with my parents. Now I am a student of 12th grade here and attended some courses related to cooking, managing families and other domestic matters. In fact, I was instructed to cook something for the school as part of a practical exam for the course of Home Economics. Accordingly, I tried to cook the food but made the blunder which leads to a fire-related incident at our kitchen. Fortunately, it was a small-scale fire and I was a bit injured while the fire destroyed some of the kitchen utensils. None else was injured in this incident.  \n\nThe course title was about cooking foods for home. It was the Food Preparation course - a part of the Home Economics subject at my school. Since I am unable to cook, it was my very first attempt to prepare something. I took preparations and a recipe book. I collected all the necessary materials for cooking and my mother also instructed me. But while I was about to light the stove, I made the mistake. In most of the parts, where we live in, people cook with stoves. Cooking in stoves requires some special set of skills. Lighting the stove is most difficult. You need to use a lighter to lit all the laces that will provide the heat by burning. Unfortunately, I failed to light the stove. It fell to the ground and the nearby stuff was set on fire.  \n\nIt was right before the day of the practical exam of the course. The students were asked to bring two pieces of paratha and cooked chicken curry from home and the teachers would score on the cooking. In fact, it was the year-ending exam and the grades on the cooking would help us to get a good grade. So, everyone tried their best to prepare the instructed items. I attempted so. But the mistake I made was horrible. Though my mother taught me to light up the stove several times, I could not imitate her rightly. So, when she was irritated with my attempts, she left me alone in the kitchen to attend to some other tasks. Hence, I commit the mistake and set a fire in the kitchen.\n\nThough the impacts were less instantly, I was shocked to a great extent. My father was worried about the issue after he heard of it. Moreover, I was unable to prepare the foods for my physical injury. I burnt both of my hands and informed the issue to my teachers. They helped me pass the course considering the issue. It was a great lesson for me. Actually, I made the mistake as I could not light up the stove perfectly. The rule to light up a stove is to light up the laces one after another. But what I did was completely wrong. I threw the matchstick on the stove that caused the fire. Consequently, my hands suffered minor injuries for the next two weeks. Now, I am extremely careful about cooking issues and try to avoid lighting up the stoves by myself."

    "Answer": "They say that health is wealth, and I also happen to fully agree with it. But, of course, different people have different ideas about the ways of maintaining a healthy lifestyle while I have mine. For me, a balanced diet is \"the key\" to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\nNow, a healthy lifestyle, in my opinion, is a way of life which allows people to become a happy and productive citizen all the way without ever becoming a burden for society. Of course, for that to happen, one has to lower the risk of being seriously ill and dying early. Besides, other important factors for maintaining a healthy lifestyle may also include getting at least 7 to 8 hours of daily sleep and also taking time for daily relaxation and recreation in order to keep the body and mind fresh.\n\nSo, how important is the role of a balanced diet in all this? Well, the answer is, more important than we would probably ever know. After all, it is the balanced diet that keeps nourishing each and every cell of our body by providing a variety of foods from the different food groups – specifically: vegetables and fruits; protein (meat, fish, eggs, beans, soy); dairy (low-fat milk, cheese, yogurt); carbohydrates (starchy foods like rice, pasta, potatoes and bread – preferably wholegrain or whole wheat varieties); and a small quantity of healthy fats.  \n\nAnyway, a balanced diet is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, primarily because it provides all kinds of important vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to keep the body and mind strong and healthy. Having a balanced diet can also help ward off numerous diseases and health complications, and help maintain healthy body weight, provide energy, allow better sleep, and improve brain function. Besides, a balanced diet also significantly improves our mental health by easing the symptoms of depression and anxiety and thus always keeping us happy and positive."

    "Answer": "A healthy lifestyle is something we all talk about but only a few of us follow the rules to maintain it. I thank you for this wonderful topic and would like to talk about the importance of a balanced diet for having a healthy lifestyle.\n\nIt is often said that 'what we eat defines what we become'. It is indeed true and in my opinion, healthy living greatly depends on someone's eating habit. Having a balanced diet means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.          \n\nA healthy lifestyle is a combination of a sober and prudent living style with the soundness of body and mind. Both physical and psychological well-being is important in order to have a healthy lifestyle. It does not depend on someone's economic status or geographic location. Rather it is the willingness to lead a good life with some fundamental good habits.\n\nA balanced diet has paramount importance to remain fit both physically and psychologically. Biologically, a person is a living organism who needs food to survive like any other living organism on this planet. As a superior creature, we have plenty of food items to choose from and in a way, this has made our food habit quite complex. Fast food, for example, in no way a good choice for us and yet we have become dependant on it. Obesity, for instance, is rare among people who have a good eating habit. Overweight has become one of the reasons people these days suffer from various diseases. Scientific research has proven that more than 30 percent health-related complexities could be avoided by having a good eating habit.\n\nThe modern era is highly competitive and we are so busy these days than the past generations. However, this does not mean that we should not be aware of our health. We have got only one chance to live and some easy-to-follow rules like following a balanced diet, regular exercise, maintaining personal hygiene etc. can make a huge difference.\n\nA sound mind lies on a sound body and a body needs calories to properly function. As an intelligent species, we should not act foolishly. We should provide our body with the right combination of food that provides necessary vitamins and calories to remain healthy - not more, not less and nothing harmful to our body and mind."

    "Answer": "Healthy lifestyle refers to the living in a planned way when someone will be fit, both mentally and physically, and free of almost all types of diseases. So, to maintain a healthy lifestyle, one should take a balanced diet and have some sort of physical exercise.\n\nThis is really an important issue to discuss. Many of us do not have the idea of a healthy lifestyle. Often people believe that having good food means they are getting healthy. But they are living in the wrong conception. In fact, only having some good foods will not make you healthy rather you need to have something more for your health. To be healthy in all terms refers that one should also be free of diseases that may weaken them at any time of the year. Hence, the term a healthy lifestyle focuses on having regular physical exercises in line with having a balanced and nutritious diet.\n\nI believe that the importance of a healthy lifestyle is great and it is only achieved when an individual can have a combination of nutritious food, moderate exercise and a life filled with happiness. Actually, a healthy lifestyle depends on how people are leading their daily lives. If they only eat rich foods and start believing that they are getting healthy, I think they are in the wrong way. To have a healthy lifestyle, one should also have to follow some other externals issues. I think taking exercises regularly is an important aspect of this issue. Having regular physical exercises help to build a healthy mind and accordingly the lifestyle becomes healthier. \n\nThis is really important for good health. In fact, this is almost impossible to attain good health without some sort of exercise. This is the key to everything. For instance, you need to burn your calories that come with your foods. If you do not burn the calories, they will make you overweight. And definitely, we do not prefer overweight. Rather, we should be fit and be able to do anything we want to do. But if we are unable to do the things we like due to the excessive healthy status of the body, it points out that we are not healthy actually. The importance of physical exercise lies here. Often it is said that health is wealth. We are accustomed to the saying and realise the statement best after we fall ill. So, this is a precondition for good health and a healthy lifestyle, I believe.  \n\nEverything is its detrimental impacts. And the lifestyle is not an exception. If someone is absorbed in an enriched living style, surely s/ he will suffer for that in some stages of life unless they are taking any preventive measures. Unluckily, most of the people are unaware of the matter that they need to have some sort of physical movements to live healthily. When the living is healthy, I think the lifestyle becomes healthy as well. Therefore, this is important to have at least 30 minutes of exercise or other types physical movements for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."

I would like to thank you for this great opportunity to talk about a person I have lately met and made a friendship with.\n \nIt would be a few months, 4 months to be more specific since I have first met Rahul. I met him in his office at Royal Street to discuss a loan he had applied for. This was strictly a professional visit to discuss the terms of the loan and investigate his company and type of business he runs. After we got introduced, I found him very friendly and amiable. He graduated from the same university from where I completed my MBA in 2014.\n\nRahul is a website and online application developer who owns a medium-sized IT firm. He comes from a rich family and has chased a different dream than his forefathers. I liked him for his friendly behaviours, innovative thinking, bravery and the sense of humour. He is such a nice person that he invited me to meet his family members at a party his family arranged a month ago, though our friendship has just begun. The main reason I found him to be a good person and nice friend is his honesty and ethics. The loan he applied for is still under review. I know that he has some good connections and powerful family members who he could easily turn to for the quick approval of this loan. But he has never used any of his influences to get advantages. He wants to achieve things he really deserves as an individual, not as a privileged person. The IT firm he is running is entirely his personal dream and achievement. He told me that he had not even taken a single penny from his father while starting this business and this is, in fact, a great determination to chase his own dream and build things with his own ability. I simply revere this quality in him. The kind of determination he has shown so far is rare among young people in our country these days.\n\nI would definitely like to spend more time with him and enhance our friendship further. In fact, I consider him a good friend already. I would like to know more about his friends, business, future plan as well as other aspects as we expect to know about from our friends. I guess we become very calculative and choosy while making friends after a certain age and in my opinion, he is worthy to be a good friend of mine."

    "Answer": "Recently I have met with Jack Ethan, a student at the undergraduate level at Cairo University. In fact, he is one of my bosom friends now. He is from Australia and studying under the International studentship. Now I will describe him in brief and thank you for the chance to talk about him.\n\nCairo University is one of the reputed universities in the world and enriched with a good number of faculties. The university offers its courses to the natives and the international students as well. Ethan joined here as an international student and I met him last month at the inauguration of our class. He is really a young gentleman and comes from a noble family in Australia. I was introduced to him as he took his seat beside me on the first day of university. Gradually, both of us discussed many issues and come to know each other. He was glad to be a part of the university like me.\n\nJack Ethan is an undergraduate student of Mass Communication at Cairo University. Like me, he is a fresher here and proudly owns a very good academic record. In fact, he never stood second in his academic career so far and thus achieved a scholarship with Cairo University. A moderately tall-figured boy, Ethan likes to read books of varied interest. The most important thing about him is that he is ready with a witty answer to almost every question. Even the professors are also unable, at times, to argue with him over any issue. For his sharper brain and analytical ability, he is now a popular one in the class. Despite being a boy from a rich family, he loves to lead a simple life. He is not an exhibitionist.\n\nEveryone likes him for his modest nature and sincerity. But I like him for some other reasons. He is a man of word. Immediately after the startup of the class, one of the course instructors asked us all to bring an assignment on report writing for media. I was no idea how should I complete that. I sought help to many but none of them agreed to help me with an idea. At that moment, Ethan came to my help. He showed me how to write a report. Besides, he also suggested some potential ideas that I can apply to the report. Though some of the classmates were my school buddies, they denied to help me while a foreigner in my land, Egypt, came forward with a helping hand. Suddenly, I realised his nobleness and started liking him from deep of my heart.  \n\nAs an Egyptian, I am aware of the culture and histories of my own country. In opposite, Ethan is aware of the very recent political issues as well. He analyses issues with a different perspective and the analysis results are outstanding. He does not talk much but able to express his feelings in a splendid way that the other students cannot. I think if I spend more time with him, it would be beneficial for me. His feelings are simple and he never rejects anyone for anything possible to him. He can deal with the worst situations and changes them in his favour. In fact, he could be a great teacher for me to teach about real-life issues. So, I want to spend more time with Ethan."

    "Answer": "Although nobody in my family has ever been involved in starting or running any kind of business, I have held a secret wish in my heart since my early high school years that one day I would start a small business to try my luck with entrepreneurship.\n\nOf course, I wasn’t too sure about what kind of business I would start, mainly because I thought that I would need a substantial amount of money to start a business. Besides, I also needed some time to understand the “tricks” of business before I could take some calculated risk in this domain.\n\nSo, I decided to wait until I actually start a job and have a first-hand experience in the real business world. By the way, later on, I realized that one didn’t really need so much money to start a small business, provided that he or she had a well-crated plan to outsmart his or competitors.\n\nBut, then just before a year, after playing with a lot of small business ideas with the scope of limited investment, I decided that I would start a fruit juice selling a business by using the possible freshest fruits. And all I needed for that was a suitable place to set up my business as well as some good and reliable sources of fresh fruits so that I didn’t really have to do juggling from one fruit seller to another. But, unfortunately, I am yet to find a suitable spot to start my fruit selling shop. On top of that, lately, I have also been very busy with my full-time job, which leaves me very little time to plan for the setup of my small business.\n\nBut, anyway, I would definitely like to start my business now because the longer I wait, the more difficult it will probably become for me to start my business. After all, the cost of starting a business keeps only rising these days, and I just don’t have the luxury to spend extra money or wait for eternity."

    "Answer": "I am really lucky to have this candidate task card topic as it is something I would be able to talk about from my heart. I am 32 and a doting father of a 4 years old daughter. Both I and my wife work and I have been planning for a while to quit my daytime job and start a small business. I personally thank you for letting me talk about it.\n\nThe small business that I have in my mind is establishing a cyber cafe in our area. The cyber cafe I have planned for would be an exclusive one and primarily target the foreign tourists who visit our area. Though there are already three cyber cafes in our locality, most tourists do not feel comfortable there as they do not have a world-class environment and high-speed internet connections. My cyber cafe would have a large zone for browsing the internet, a small cafeteria, a bookselling point and definitely a very classy environment. If I can make my cybercafe popular, I would then plan to expand it in other tourists spots in my city.\n\nFrankly speaking, I and my wife want to start it right now! However, from a practical point of view, it would take us another year to start it. The budget we would need to manage to launch this cybercafe is yet to be managed and we want to start it from the savings we have without taking a loan from a bank or family members. Moreover, we would need to resign from our current jobs and then arrange a suitable location and a great interior designer for our cafe. We will also need to hire 7-8 staff members to run this business. These all seem time-consuming to me and up until last January, we were not absolutely convinced that the time has come for us to start something of our own. Probably this is the main reason we are yet to start it.\n\nWhy do we want to start it? Well, I am not satisfied with my current job. Though I get a steady amount of money per month from my job, I have little time to spend with my family, take vacations and enjoy things I feel passionate about. The office consumes more than 50 hours weekly and most of my energy and this is why I often feel stressed out. I can not take vacations and manage time to visit my relatives. 'Freedom' - I guess is the reason I would like to start this business. I also want to stay close to my family and work as a free-lance journalist for a local daily newspaper. I have got only one life and I want to enjoy it and explore more possibilities."

    "Answer": "This is a great topic to discuss and thank you for allowing me on the issue. Photography is an art but not everyone is the artist here. It requires some specific set of skills and expertise to capture a moment nicely. Besides, this is a very good business as well. So, I want to start photography as a small business for me.\n\nPhotography is now one of the most impressive ways to earn and a type of small business for the individual level. Since I am a student at graduate level, I think the earning would be enough for me. Besides, it would not hamper my academic activities as well. A large number of people, particularly students are engaged in this profession while most of them have no professional certifications in photography. But my six-month-long course on photography has made me skilled enough to undertake this scheme. In fact, this is the small business where you do not need to invest a huge amount of money to start with.\n\nI am planning to start the business from next year. I live with my parents and this is a joint family in India. So, it often becomes difficult for the family heads to run the family expenses. My father is to pay a notable amount of his income after my education at a private university here in Delhi. So, I want to start the business as soon as possible. I have also arranged for enough money to buy a top-quality digital camera. If everything goes right with me, I am planning to advertise for my business. I have also planned to arrange for an office room on the ground floor of the house we live in. I have to pay the rent for the room though it belongs to my family.  \n\nI had long been planning to do something for myself so that I could bear my own expenses. Hence, the idea of photography appeared in my mind and I started thorough research. Actually, I wanted to be a professional photographer in all terms and thus I planned the entire scheme into different parts. As part of the plan, I had to complete a professional photography course. Then I learnt photo editing. These activities took around one year to complete. Basically, people seek skilled photographers with the latest device and technical know-how about photo editing. Without preparation, I would be unable to satisfy my potential clients. So, I could not start the business earlier.  \n\nPhotography is a hobby to many but this is a business scheme for me to bear my own expenses. It has potentials to grow. I took several professional training to be a notable photographer and take the right shot at the right moment. There are certain categories but I have mastered almost all the skills. So, I think I would be a versatile photographer and someday will be a reputed one. I have planned to start it now and gradually I will grow. I also dream to open a professional photography institute in the long run but to fulfil the dream I have to survive. Initially, the income I will generate will be sufficient to meet my expenses and also I would be able to contribute to my family income as well. Considering all the issues, I want to start photography as my own small business that will grow to the extreme in future."

Of course, the weathermen try their best to assure us with their data and statistics, but the weather doesn’t really have to respect any of it, just as it didn’t when I planned for a visit to watch the cultural performance of my little nephew about a few months ago.\n\nThis was the first cultural show for my little 5-year-old nephew, and there was no way that he would want me to miss it. He was so excited about that show of his that he even asked me about what I would do if I liked his performance. Of course, I told him that I would offer him the best gift ever. But, anyway, as I was getting ready to go to the school of my nephew in order to see his performance, I suddenly noticed that sky had become really dark with the dark cloud.\n\nAfter seeing that condition, I decided to wait for a little, thinking that the dark cloud would go away. But, instead of getting the sky cleared, thunderstorm and heavy rain also started to follow suit to make things even worse. So, instead of going to see the cultural programme of my nephew, I and the other members of my family began to worry about the safety of my nephew at school. Then, people around me assured me that the school was safe.\n\nBy the way, the heavy rain and thunderstorm had continued for almost 50 minutes, all I could do is to wait inside my home and hope for the bad weather to go away. After all, it wasn’t safe to go out in that kind of bad weather.\n\nAnyway, as the initial plan to attend the cultural programme got cancelled due to the bad weather, I decided to read a good storybook to spend the evening.

    "Answer": "This is a nice topic to talk about and I have experienced this exact situation several times in my life. I thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about an event when the sudden change of the weather ruined a long-desired plan.\n\nIt was 2014 and on my younger sister's birthday, most of my cousins, uncles and aunts came to our house. Next day my father proposed that we should take a family trip and go to (...say the name of a sea beach...) to enjoy our time together as a family. It was a great proposal and we were all excited to spend our time there. Two of my cousins and their parents had never been to this beach. \"Though we spent our childhood together in a joint family in our early childhood, we hardly get time to enjoy together\" - told Tom, one of our cousins and he was completely right. We were very happy to have our relatives at our home, celebrate our sister's birthday and have the opportunity to make a family tour together after a long.\n\nIn the morning my father proposed us to take our cars and visit the sea beach and other tourist spots the next day and it was a sunny day with a clear blue sky at that time. The weather forecast, that I checked online, showed that there was no possibility of rain and the temperature would remain almost the same. But our luck must have been quite bad as the weather completely changed in the evening. While we did not even expect the rain, there was a thunderstorm with the torrent. The wind was ferocious and the storm lasted for a long time. The sea beach thus was not a good place to visit the next day. It was a 4 hours journey and we were supposed to go there early next morning. However, the weather condition forced us to abandon the tour and stay home. The weather was still ferocious and it was unsafe for us to leave the house.\n\nWhen my parents declared that we have to cancel our tour, I, with four of my cousins, planned to watch movies, play computer games and meet some of my friends at their home. At around 11.30 am, when the weather was still bad, we watched an animated movie while my parents were busy cooking. We ate homemade popcorns, coffee and hamburger. In the evening the rain stopped and we went to meet my friends who happened to live nearby. At night we played different types of indoor games and that was fun.\n\nThough our initial plan was ruined due to a sudden weather change, nevertheless, I enjoyed my time with my cousins. I am the only child of my parents and that's why my cousins are like my siblings and I enjoy their company a lot."

    "Answer": "Like many others, I also like to have my quiet times once in a while in order to calm my mind down and find some peace. So, thank you for this interesting cue card topic and the opportunity to talk about one of my favourite quiet places where I go sometimes.\n\nThis quiet place, where I like to go sometimes, is a small valley located a bit far away from my home, next to a garden of many different kinds of native plants. Not sure, when or how the valley was formed there as no water streams could be found anywhere near it, but I have always that there might be some interesting history behind this small valley.\n\nBut, anyway, this is a valley that feels like located thousands of miles away from civilization, when I visit it with an upset or restless mind, because of its truly quiet surroundings. Of course, one could easily listen to the chirping sounds of the birds from its adjacent native garden, but that sound is nowhere close to as disturbing as the sound of a busy city; rather quite the opposite. In fact, if anything, that chirping sound of the birds feels very much reassuring to me as it reminds me about some many wonderful things in an otherwise tough world.\n\nI like to visit this place only during the late morning because this is when I get to enjoy some refreshingly gentle southern wind, offering some calming effects on my otherwise restless mind. By the way, I like to visit this place, not only because it is nice and quiet, but also because I can see the whole sky in its true colours from here.\n\nAnyway, whenever I go to this place, I spend my time there by mostly walking across the valley just like I did the last time. However, when I went there last time, I spent some time there also reading a book while laying myself down on its ground."

    "Answer": "Bill Fredrick Park in Orlando is a quiet place and I often go there to spend some leisure hours. This is a park that has an area of 180 acres and the environment is so amicable. The vastness of the park helps people to submerge into silence. This is a nice candidate task for me and I will explain the matter in brief here.\n\nI like to go there for relaxation and I prefer the evening hours. After passing few busy days at the university, I really need some moments for myself. A tranquil place like this park is the right one for me. I also have plans to spend a night in the park by camping and count the unlimited stars in the wide-open sky, hope this will happen soon. I like the place for some specific reasons. The park is one of the most impressive sites in the state. The golf course is adorable and boating is another interesting activity here. The sandy trails are awesome for hiking. Besides, the park contains some other amenities like clean and well-managed toilets, and the space for kids etc. is also notable. The park is not far away from the downtown Orlando. It is only a 20-minute drive from the city. A large number of trees are available in the park and anyone can take shelter under the tree shades with nice sitting arrangements.  \n\nWhen I went to the park last time, I had a wonderful experience. It was a family get together. We reached there in the evening at the pre-booked location inside the park. We all stayed a night camping in a camping zone. The barbeque party was amazing and it was arranged by my uncle. Fishing in the lake was another interesting event. We all were happy. I would recommend anyone from my area to have some quality and tranquil time in this park. There is a lot to explore and enjoy."

    "Answer": "I have been lucky to have a number of memorable journeys over the years. So, thank you very much for offering me this great opportunity to share the experience of one of those journeys which I probably would never forget.\n\nThis journey, one of the most memorable ones of my life, took place when I just started my university, and I needed to visit my youngest uncle at a city, far away from my hometown, where he just had started his first job. So, naturally, I was quite excited. The excitement grew even bigger when one of my elder cousins, who also was travelling with me, informed me that we were actually going to make the journey with a high-speed train which just had started operating from my home town only a few weeks ago.\n\nWe were told that it was going to be a 6 to 7 hours journey and that train would travel, nonstop, at a speed of 200 kilometers per hour. So, it was a whole new experience for me, and I just couldn’t wait to board the train as soon as I arrived at the station. By the way, my cousin very smartly had selected a couple of window seats at the front of the brand new train, so we both knew that it was going to be a great experience, and it indeed was as the train started to run like a bullet with a whistle within seconds of starting our journey. The objects outside the train felt like they were just coming at our sight and vanishing like some ghosts within a fraction of a second.\n\nAnyway, I remember every minute of this journey so well, mainly because I never really travelled on a train that ran so fast and furiously. I remember it also because the service on that train was awesome. Finally, I also tried some of the most delicious foods I have ever eaten, and that too at an affordable price!"

I was amazed by the journey and the experience will be memorable always. This cue card appears exciting and I will describe the event in brief now. \n\nI travelled by aeroplane and also used some other local transports in the USA. But the journey by aeroplane was the most impressive one in my life. It took around 11 hours to reach the USA from Greece. I reached the airport in my private car and then boarded in the aeroplane. I was too excited that I could not sleep the entire time. Initially, I felt a bit of uncomfortable as it was my first air ride too. But gradually I coped with the situation. I had to visit the country for some official purposes. I am a senior reporter of health in a national newspaper of Greece. A conference of the journalists dealing with health issues was supposed to take place in the USA. My office authority selected me to join the conference. I was chosen for my extraordinary performance in reporting about the health issues of the country.   \n\nI can recall every detail of the journey. In fact, I was really happy to have the chance to visit America and the flight was really enjoyable. I joined at the conference and presented a paper as well which was appreciated heavily by the other participants at the conference. Moreover, I also received a prestigious certificate for participating in this international conference. I had visited in different parts of New York, where the conference took place. Considering everything, it was a great trip in my life and I will never forget my experience from this trip."

    "Answer": "After leaving university about 7 years ago, I didn’t really feel interested in taking part in any kind of sport competition. But all that changed when my current office decided to organize an inter-departmental annual indoor sports competition a year ago and kind of “pushed” me to take part in this competition because there were not enough people to compete in my accounting department, where I work a senior accountant.\n\nAnyway, my office organizes this kind of competition pretty much every year, but I always somehow had managed to stay away from this annual interdepartmental competition on the ground that I was and is never a competitive minded person. But, last year, when I was convinced that my participation would mean a lot for my fellow employees, I decided to take part in it. After all, I also told to myself that this was really tough to work round the year without any meaningful break from the monotonous work schedule.\n\nSo, anyway, different competitions, like volleyball, sprint, music completion and table tennis, were held marking the event. Needless to say, I took part in table tennis because that I thought was easiest sport which required minimum physical effort. Of course, I could have taken part in the music competition, but I was pretty sure that I would scare a lot more people with my musical voice than actually drawing them close!\n\nBy the way, the prizes were attractive, as the company arranged for some attractive looking electronic home appliances for the winners, including a large screen TV set for the first prize winner, an expensive microwave oven for the runners-up and a nice looking toaster for the third position.\n\nWell, I took part in the competition for a couple of reasons. The prime motivation, of course, was to make my fellow employees happy since they couldn’t make a full team without me. I took part in this annual tournament also because I wanted to check if I was still as energetic as my college years."

    "Answer": "It was an inter-department annual indoor sports competition at my office and a circular was issued for all notifying the issue. I am an accountant and work for a locally reputed manufacturing company in Argentina. The company manufactures plastic materials for daily use. I feel lucky to have this cue card topic and I will explain the matter briefly.\n\nI took part in an indoor game. My office organizes the competition annually to make the employees feel relaxed. In fact, this is really tough to work round the year without any reliable break. So, different competitions were held marking the event. I took part in chess and cards. There were some other competitions like passing the pillow for the female employees. Table tennis was the other important competition that I did not dare to take part in. However, the prizes were attractive. The company arranged for home appliances for the winners - a large screen television set for the first prize winner, a washing machine for the second and a microwave oven for the third position. But all the participants received some other awards for their participation. Actually, the authority did not disappoint anyone of the participants. I won the third prize and another small prize for my participation. It was an enjoyable event indeed.   \n\nI took part in the competition for some reasons. The prime motivation behind participating was to check my skills in indoor games. I was skilled in chess when I was a student but had not been in practice for a long time. The notice for the annual competition brought the chance for me to repair my skills. Moreover, I enjoy playing chess and cards. And participating in the competition was enjoyable too. Considering the reasons, I took part in this competition and won two prizes."

    "Answer": "Like everybody else, I also like receiving gifts whether there is an occasion for it or not. But, of course, receiving it on a special occasion makes it even more special.\n\nNow, please don’t get me wrong when I say that I am rather sceptical about receiving clothing items as gifts, mainly because they don’t quite fit on me most of the times. And even when those clothing gift items fit me, I usually find them way off base from my personal taste. In fact, there have only been two people in my whole life who could really pick out the best clothes that I like with consistency. One of them is my mother and the other one is an uncle of mine. All other people fail for the most part when it comes to picking up a perfect clothing gift item for me.\n\nBut, a couple of years ago, one of my co-workers surprised me with his pick of a winter jacket which he gave me as a gift on my 29th birthday. To be honest, this was one of the best winter jackets I had ever seen up and until that point. It didn’t only fit me perfectly, but also looked very classy and elegant with its distinguished, shiny navy blue colour. Just from the look of it, one could easily understand that it was an expensive jacket, which was made with some top-class fabrics. On top of that, it was also waterproof and light to carry. By the way, I became so happy with the gift of my co-worker that I actually promised him to buy a perfect gift for him at a later time.\n\nAnyway, the winter jacket was an important clothing item for me, mainly because it didn’t only help me feel comfortable during the winter but also allowed me to make a fashion statement to other people. Besides, the gift also brought back some sort of confidence in other people who wanted to offer me clothing items as a gift."

The fabric was attractive and the colour was impressive. I felt lucky to have that on my share. This seems a nice candidate task card topic and I am very glad to describe the gift in short.   \n\nI received the suit on the evening before my birthday party began. My dad rushed to the home and asked me to meet him in his room. I knew that he was trying to surprise me with something. But I did not understand that this would be a nice piece of a suit. In fact, it was out of my idea that he would bring the suit for me. I did not know how he got the measurement of my body as the suit took me in perfectly. My father is an interesting man. He loves to surprise people. But most of the time, the people – whom he is trying to surprise, get ideas about the surprise. So, he is unable to surprise them in most of the cases. But in this case, I was really surprised and my dad was happy to complete his mission. He gave me the costume and it cost him a lot, I know.  \n\nOf course, it was an extraordinary gift to me. It was from my father whom I adore the most in my life. Besides, it was my birthday gift from him. So, definitely, this was an important gift for me. Moreover, the suit was made of the colour I really like. It was dark blue and sewed from a renowned and specialized tailor of the city. I have been using the suit to attend formal occasions and take the right care of it."

    "Answer": "Even though I never like to consider myself as a good or successful organizer, I was given the responsibility to organize a few events in my life. Of those events, I consider at least one as a successful one, and today, I would like to talk about it here.\n\nThe event, I organized, was an outdoor concert party which was basically organized to mark the beginning of a local trade fair in my big hometown about 5 years ago. Now, I am not sure why the trade show organizing committee picked me to organize that concert party, but I am assuming that it must have had something to do with my connection with a few popular concert groups of my country.\n\nBy the way, this trade fair was an annual thing in my hometown, and I always used to participate in it as an “announcer”. So, yes, I was already a familiar face in that trade show, and therefore, it was only natural that organizer of that trade show had trusted me with such a challenging task.\n\nBut, of course, I couldn’t have possibly managed to organize the concert all by self, and so, I took the help from a few close university friends of mine who were even more enthusiastic than me about organizing that event. In fact, they didn’t only help me in organizing the concert, but also they made sure that the trade show activities also had gone well. The concert had continued for more than 2 hours, but I am sure that the memory of it lasted for years after it.\n\nAnyway, I think that the event was a great success, primarily because a lot of young people from all over the town, as well as from outside of it, attended the concert and enjoyed it until the end. Besides, the sales at trade fair had significantly increased on that evening which, after all, was the real purpose of organizing the concert on rather short notice."

The participants at the event highly praised it and everyone was happy about the whole event. The function was held marking the last class in the college. Preparations for the event began about one week before the day.\n\nThe event took place in the college classroom. Earlier, it was planned that we should go out and celebrate the party but later one of our teachers suggested to arrange it in our class. Following his instructions, we changed the plan and accordingly prepared for the event. It was really an enjoyable event for all of us.\n\nPreparations for the event was really hefty and I had to undergo lots of trouble during the entire week to make this happen. I made a team of four other members including Samuel, Jack, Jones, and Robin. Honestly, without their direct help, it was really impossible for me to complete the event. Inviting the principal was another big issue. He was a very busy person and ensuring his presence at the class party was the most challenging task so far. I was really grateful to my teammates as they helped me to have a blast in the party.\n\nThis was a successful party considering some reasons. The most important issue was that the class took a festive look. Every one of my class attended the party, and even the boy who did not attend classes with various excuses was also present in this day. We all made fun, took lunch together and shared our memories with the college. The principal gave a short lecture and wished us luck in future. Based on the grounds, I think it was a successful event."

He’s constantly in the news at the moment because of being the most popular foreign politician in the world.\n\nNow, I don’t know that much about him, or even agree with some of the things that he says – but he certainly seems to be popular with a large section of the population, not only in Canada but also in rest of the world. But, based on whatever information I have gathered about him so far, it would be fair to assume that he genuinely wants to make our world a better and more peaceful place for living by reaching out to every leader on this planet in order to solve its pressing problems.\n\nOf course, many might argue here that a lot of other world leaders are trying to do the same thing, and therefore, there probably isn’t anything much about him which makes him such a sought-after personality in the world news these days. Well, such argument could be true to some extent, but none of those other leaders has been a teacher, an actor, a nightclub bouncer, a snowboard, a white water rafting instructor, and even a boxer before becoming a prime minister or a president, have they? And precisely because of these reasons, which makes him such a prolific personality, that I want to meet him. But, I also want to meet him because he believes in true diversity and because he really wants to deal with the dangerous climate situation that the world is facing today.\n\nAnyway, after meeting this great political personality, I would ask him just one question, and that is why on earth he wanted to take on such a difficult role and becoming a prime minister of a country while he had all the means and resources at his disposal to enjoy the rest of his life as an actor or teacher!"

His bestselling book is the talk of the town and the news agencies, newspapers and magazines are after him to make stories about his book and contribution to the contemporary literature.   \n\nI would like to meet Mr Jonathan for some solid reasons. The topmost issue about meeting him is to know about his writing. He writes smoothly and when the readers read the stories, it appears that the events are before them. In fact, I, as a reader of his book, has become his great fan. His narrative style is also different than other writers. He uses a different tone to describe the events through his writings. Besides, his plots are also interesting and will make you amazed. Before publishing the book, he was not that much familiar in the locality and people knew him as a simple man. But now he has become a celebrity by dint of the news.    \n\nI have so many questions for him to ask. If I get the chance to meet him, I will ask him first about his story plots and outlines.

It is because of using computers that we can finish complex tasks at the office in minutes instead of waiting a week. Besides, it is the computers automated system that allows manufacturing companies to manufacture hundreds of vehicles in a day which would have probably taken years to do.\n\nNot to mention, of course, a huge benefit it has brought in making numerous new discoveries in the space as well as in the other planets. So, really, the benefits of computer are numerous whether we are just using to browse something with the help of internet or trying to calculate the rotation speed of a new planet in a new solar system.

So, when a couple of my friends told me that they were going to visit the beautiful countryside in the southern part of (...say your country name...), I became really excited. Our trip began around 8 am in the morning, and after riding the bus for about 4 hours, we finally arrived at our destination.\n\nNeedless to say, we were all taken aback by the sheer beauty of the landscape around us as the scenery just stretches off into the horizon, as far as our eyes could see, with miles and miles of rice fields shimmering in the heat haze. The paddy fields were divided into broad rectangular shapes, making them look like some beautifully decorated “green chamber”. Occasionally a tree would rise up out of the paddies, claiming to be the only biggest thing there, while providing a seat for the crows and other birds that flew around. The flapping sounds of the birds there invited us to watch them fly under the blue and beautiful sky. The presence of green meadow creek on one side of the vast paddy fields and the beautiful lake, flowing through it, make it look like a little piece of heaven on the earth. The serene and quiet nature of this beautiful countryside was so enjoyable that we didn’t really want to return back to our home in the city.\n\nAnyway, I would surely go back to that place in future because this is where I could find my peace and serenity.

I would like to thank you for this nice cue card topic.\n\nThe island is located adjacent to the Queensland coast in Australia. I went there with my family members. Actually, it was a two-day trip to the island for holiday purposes. I was accompanied by my parents and siblings. Everyone was happy with the natural view of the island. The sand was the most attractive thing there and now it has become an eco-tourism destination in the country. We paid a visit to the Cathedrals, the cliff which is also famous for the sculpted ribbons, and swimming sites.\n\nThe place was enjoyable for its natural beauties. The freshwater lakes, camping facilities, fishing on the lakes, swimming in the freshwater pools etc. are the key attractions. In fact, we need to take leaves from our daily life sometimes, and this is a perfect place to enjoy the leaves. The site is enlisted with the World Heritage Site and offers a wide number of natural resources to explore. The rainforest is another attraction of this location which allows the visitors to walk along. The area is blessed with over 100 freshwater lakes which are always crowded with swimmers.\n\nIf I get a chance again, I will get back there in the future.

Talking about new business, I actually did notice the other day that a new shop has been opened in one of the posh areas of my city.\n\nThe new shop, I am talking about, is a clothing outlet which sells all kinds of clothing items for the ladies. The name of this shop is “Look All Classy”, and it sells mostly top class and top brand clothing items from all over the world.\n\nI also noticed that there is a big parking space, surrounding the shopping outlet, where one can see all kinds of expensive and nice-looking cars. By the way, the shop is made of all kinds of expensive and polished building materials which makes it look really shiny and beautiful, not only from outside of the shop but also from inside.\n\nSitting in a perfect location at one corner of the city, the shop can be accessed from all direction. Not to mention, of course, the decoration inside the shop as well as the nice display design in it makes it look even more appealing to its customers. Therefore, given the posh location of this shop, its shiny and expensive look, and with the nice and expensive cars parked in front of it, it can be easily said that mostly rich and high-end customers visit this store in order to buy their clothing items.\n\nAnyway, I haven’t really bought anything from this high-class retail shop, mainly because this shop is primarily for women. And, I wouldn’t really go there to buy anything for my wife, sister or mother because I have no intention to spend my money unnecessarily on some “branded” clothing items that are seven to eight times higher than the price we usually pay for clothing items. Having said that, however, I am sure that my wife and sisters would just die to visit that place!"

Being located in the centre of the town, the shop is accessible from every corner and remains open round the day. This is a great shop for the babies and provides a wide range of necessary stuff for the people. Interestingly, it sells almost all types of products for babies ranging from zero to five years old.\n\nNew parents are the typical customers for this shop. Besides, the other parents who have babies under five-years-old at their home are also the visitors to this shop. They frequently visit the shop and get their necessaries. The options are broad and thus there are plenty of chances to get the right product for their babies. Moreover, people who need any baby products and cannot find them in other places also visit this shop. This is of great importance to them.\n\nRecently, I had to visit the shop for getting a baby product. In fact, one of my cousins has become a new mother and I went to see the baby. Before visiting the baby, I was planning to what I can take as a gift for the baby. Suddenly, I realized that a baby shop is the best place to find the right thing for the newborn. I visited the shop and got some clothes for this newly born angel."

    "Answer": "I like different kinds of artworks, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that I am an expert in artworks. But, still, I will try my best to describe a work of art, which I really like.\n\nAnyway, the artwork, I am about to describe, is called “Mont Sainte-Victoire”. It is actually a series of oil paintings by the French artist Paul Cézanne who painted it around 1905.\n\nThe artwork depicts a mountain in France called “Mont Sainte-Victoire” in a very beautiful manner which overlooks Aix-en-Provence (the town where Cézanne was born). I saw it first in an international art gallery of my country about a few years ago. Back then, I didn’t really manage to make a much of it, but as I saw it again on a famous painting book, featuring all the famous artworks from 20th century, as well as on the internet, I slowly started to realize how beautiful and articulated this series of artworks really is, especially the limestone peak of Mont Sainte-Victoire. In his word, the artist tried to bring a certain order and clarity to nature by using simplified shapes that include triangles, flat planes, cylinders, rhomboids and the like.\n\nBesides, he is also seen to be very keen in maintaining perfect geometric motifs in this artwork while using two perfect colour schemes in order to create a natural atmosphere around the mountain peak as well as the depth of the mountain. He also uses layers of paint to build up a set of horizontal planes that draw the eyes into the picture from far away.\n\nAnyway, I like this piece of artwork, mainly because even though, the mountain peak in the image dominates the landscape around the mountain and commands our attention, filling our eyes and minds, it can actually come as something of a shock to discover that such a prominent natural feature can be very far away from us. Besides, I like also because it is a stunningly simple artwork and yet it would captivate your mind from the moment you put your eyes on it."

    "Answer": "Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting which is extremely famous in the whole world. It was created by Leonardo da Vinci. And in fact, this is the most known and most praised paintings in the world. A wide number of criticisms are found in this painting. I am really lucky to have this candidate task card and will explain this painting which is one of the finest artworks the world has ever produced.\n\nI first saw the painting at a museum in Paris. I was a kid then. Later, I came to know about the vastness of this piece of art. Actually, my parents took me to the Louvre Museum in Paris where I first met with this painting and the character. When I grew up, I paid some visits to the same museum only to see the painting. It is said that the painting is the portrait of a woman named Lisa who was the wife of a nobleman at that time.\n\nI like the painting for a few specific reasons. The most important reason for liking the painting is the mysterious smile of the character portrayed in. The historical value of this painting also notable. Though no exact date of origin for this painting is found, it is assumed that it has been painted in 1506. The past history of this painting also attracts me. It was acquired by King Francis but later, the painting has become the property of the French government. Moreover, it has been exhibited since 1797 in the display of this museum for permanently.\n\nHonestly, I did not have any special feeling when I first saw it. Actually, I was a small boy then. But gradually I came to know about the history of the painting and a special attraction grew in me. Now I am a diehard fan of this painting indeed."

    "Answer": "I am fond of poems as well as other great literary works as they help me spend my spare time and give me immense joys. Of course, by saying this, I am in no way suggesting that I am qualified enough to be a good critique of any kind of literary works. But, still, I will go ahead and try my best to talk about a fiction literature work, which I really like, without sounding like a complete layman.\n\nThe literary work, I want to talk about, is called “The Old Man and The Sea”. It is a famous novel which was written by the American famous Nobel Laureate Ernest Miller Hemingway in the year of 1952.\n\nI first read it when I was a 2nd-year college student, at a time when I was really depressed and down because of some family problems. But, of course, when I read it for the first time, I couldn’t really understand the philosophical nature of the novel, perhaps because I was a bit too young and restless as a college student. But, as I read it a few more times after that, I figured out that it certainly deserved to be called a classic and allegorical piece of literature.\n\nAnyway, the plot of this classic literature tells the story of an epic struggle between an old, impoverished and seasoned fisherman and the greatest catch of his life. For eighty-four days, Santiago, an aged Cuban fisherman, has set out to sea and returned to the shore empty-handed, even though he caught the biggest fish of his life, only to find it, of course, to be eaten by a huge shark. Essentially, ''The Old Man and the Sea'' examines man's place in the world in a very succinct manner while exploring his need for survival.\n\nAnyway, I like this literary work, primarily because it is a short story, would only take a part of the day if you read it at a stretch, and yet one of the few beautiful stories mankind will ever get a chance to read. Besides, I like this work also because, with every word we read, we actually become silently inspired."

    "Answer": "It is a satirical poem and it deals with the present state of artworks in the world. I heard it from the poet at a meeting held at my university. In fact, the poem was a protest against the current situation of the literary works. This candidate task is interesting and I am happy to have this on my share.\n\nI came to know about the poem at the university conference hall. I was the anchor in the event and had to host the entire event from beginning to the end. When the poet came to deliver the lecture, he recited the poem and I came to know about it. I saw him that he was writing something before delivering the lecture but could not guess what he was writing. Later, when he told about the poem, I was astonished that how a man can compose such a nice poem in a short time. Moreover, each of the lines was impressive. I have never heard or read such an interesting poem before.\n\nAnd I like the poem based on some grounds. First of all, it was an interesting creation and the theme was about the disastrous condition of the world. The poem also indicated about the deteriorating status of the society and even the literature is being influenced by corruption. Now literature is being used as a tool to serve any specific political purposes instead of entertaining the people. So, people are expressing their reluctance to literary works.  \n\nI was really amazed by the poem. Actually, the poem was made to criticize the modern-day activities of the artwork activists. The poet wanted to make it clear that artworks should solely aim to satisfy the common people not to serve the political or other goals."

    "Answer": "Not even a couple of decades ago, we could actually count the number of all the high-paying jobs in our country with hands. But, with more advance education and level of skills, the number of high paying jobs has substantially increased, and today I would like to talk about one of those high-paying jobs.\n\nThe high paying job, I would like to talk about, is called “Software Developer”. It also interchangeably called as a “Computer Programmer” or “Application Developer”.\n\nBut, whatever is that we like to call it, this is the most sought-after job today in my country, not only because of the high salary it offers but also because of the status and professional prestige it carries.\n\nThis popular job, of course, is not an easy one by any stretch of the imagination since it requires a very high level of skills and expertise along with a higher level of educational qualification. Anyway, the roles and responsibilities of a Computer Programmer may include, but certainly not limited to, writing numerous lines of computer codes, which sometimes may take a year if not longer, in order to accomplish a certain task as per the requirements or demands of a business or company. By the way, the scope of using these computer programmes is so vast in today’s world and businesses that a computer programmer never feels secured with any particular coding styles of his, and hence the challenge for an accomplished computer programmer is never expected to be reduced.\n\nAnyway, the minimum requirements for getting this job in my country are that you will at least have to have a tertiary level of education in computer science or computer engineering major. Becoming an expert at different kinds of computer programming languages like C/C++, Java, Python, PHP and Ruby, and database applications like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and so on, just to name a few, is also an important requirement to get this job. Finally, learning about two major computer operating systems, like “Widows” and Unix/Linux, in great details is also very important for a person to get the job as a Computer Programmer. But, above all, one has to have a certain aptitude and problem-solving skills for this job."

    "Answer": "Lawyer's job is a highly paid job in Germany. This is a fascinating job and is related to providing legal services and supports to the people who are in need. The people who are engaged in the job are skilled and they also have a very good public relation. This is a great cue card for me and I am feeling exalted with this topic.\n\nThe job of a lawyer involves a wide number of things. When people are in legal troubles, they need to get support from lawyers as they do not understand or know about the legal matters. As a result, the lawyers are of great help to them. They also help to get justice for the deprived people if needed. In fact, without the help of a lawyer, it is not possible to stand before a court and place the arguments. The lawyers play the role of advocates for their clients in the court.\n\nThis is a popular job across Germany. A good number of students are pursuing the degree to become a lawyer. The lawyers could be hired or they can also get connected with larger companies as in-house lawyers. When they work with companies, they cannot practise privately. But there are some lawyers who are freelancers. They work round the day for their clients. When a lawyer gets involved with a firm, s/ he gets a smart amount of salary for the service. So, this has become a popular career among the young generation.     \n\nCompletion of at least a Bachelor’s Degree in law is a must to become a lawyer. Besides, the lawyer should also pass the law school admission test in the respective region and pass the Bar examination. These are the basic requirements to be a lawyer. But to become a great lawyer, someone needs experience, great knowledge of the laws and judicial system. Getting hired by a top-notch law firm ensures a bright career and a great remuneration."

    "Answer": "I like to remain updated with the latest news and views of the world around me, and for that, I use different kinds of news outlets like newspapers, TV and radio. But, of course, when we learn about any kind of news on these media outlets, the last thing, we want to know, are some news about violence or riots, just as I learned about it about a long time ago in the year of 2002.\n\nThe communal riot, I am talking about, took place in the state of Gujrat in India. But, since I was really young at that time, I couldn’t really get to the core of the news as much conflicting information was coming out from different kinds of news media. But, whatever was the news, I could very well understand that many innocent people were being killed in a devastating communal riot between 'the majority Hindu citizens' and 'the minority Indian Muslim' population.\n\nLittle later, it became abundantly clear that it was a terrible event that should have never happened in the first place. By the way, different news media attributed this terrible and tragic incident to some unfortunate misunderstanding between the Hindu people and the Muslim people, after the burning of a train that took place in the city of Godhra on 27th of February of 2002, killing many people.\n\nHowever, the riot had continued for about 3 months, and people with a conscience from both sides tried to end the violence through constructive dialogues. But, such noble efforts couldn’t really affect the outcome of this terrible incident, leaving 1044 people dead.\n\nAnyway, my heart really felt very heavy after hearing the tragic news. I wanted to do something to stop the riot and violence, but who would care what I had to say? After hearing the news, I also kept asking myself as to what could have possibly turned some humans, the greatest creation of God, so violent!? But, I knew that I couldn’t do anything to stop the riot, so I just kept praying to God to stop it as quickly as possible."

Police controlled the situation but it was too late when the police arrived on the spot. This is a nice candidate task card and I am happy to get it in my share. I will describe the entire event in brief now.\n\nI went to Nepal a couple of years ago to deal with a local company of the country who wanted to import some goods that my company manufactured. During the meeting, someone entered and told that a serious communal riot has been going on in the neighbouring country and the number of injuries is increasing. The man entered in the middle of the meeting only to share the news as the father of that company owner lived in India.\n\nLater I heard the news on television and am international television channel was broadcasting the event live. The television report attracted attention from all of us and we were thundered seeing the attacking scenes. They were severely attacking each other and even the television reporter also had to take shelter from the violence of the people. The meeting was cancelled and the company owner immediately tried to contact his father in India.\n\nIt was a pathetic event and a notable number of people were affected in various degrees. I was sad hearing about the people who lost their lives. The issue became highlighted in both the local and international media. I returned home with a heart filled with sadness."

Today, I will talk about that popular sport that I attended about 8 years ago.\n\nThis popular sports event called the national football league tournament in which all of the top-rated football clubs of my country used to take part. All of these football clubs had a very significant support base all over the country. As a crazy fan of this great sport called “football”, I also had my own favourite club. The club, I supported, wasn’t really one of the best in the tournament, but still, I supported it because they represented the region in which I lived.\n\nBy the way, this football tournament used to take place in the capital city of my country, and my parents wouldn’t really allow me to travel to the capital city just to watch some game since I was so young. So, all I could do was to watch the games on television. But, when my team somehow managed to reach the semi-final of the tournament, I had to go to watch the game by being present at the stadium. So, I begged my parents and they allowed me to go with a few high school friends of mine, who also supported the same club. Anyway, in that semi-final match, my club lost, but it was the best football match I had ever watched. The shouting, the tension, the intensity of the competition in the field – everything made the match so much enjoyable and unforgettable.\n\nAnyway, this is a popular event in my country because people from all walks of life in my country try to visit the stadium in order to watch this particular tournament. Besides, the huge prize money, which is awarded to the champion and the runners-up of this tournament, has taken this tournament to a new height of popularity."

In fact, it was one of the most wonderful carnivals I have ever seen. It ran for around two weeks but I could not participate the whole two weeks. This candidate task card topic is indeed very nice and I will answer the remaining parts in brief here.\n\nI work for a multinational car manufacturing company and it wanted to expand its existing branch in Spain. So, I was sent there to set up the right strategies at the beginning of this year. I stayed there for two weeks but the carnival began in the last week of my stay. Hence, it was troublesome for them to attend all the days as I had to finish my duties assigned from the main office. However, I enjoyed the event and also participated in some of the popular activities.   \n\nI went with a team of experts who also were responsible to assess the market and set the strategies. I was responsible to accumulate all the strategies together and make a final plan if the company will start moving with the plan or not. But the other team members were too much busy and could not enjoy the event. So, most of the time, I had to be alone while participating in the carnival. But the Spanish people were friendly and when they know that I was a foreigner, every one of them extended their helping hands.    \n\nI have visited some other countries but did not find such an interesting public event. I enjoyed the musical performances and the lyrics were outstanding. The carnival costumes were beautiful while the face paintings were adorable too.  Based on the reasons, I enjoyed this event greatly."

    "Answer": "The town, in which I live, is not exactly a big one where many industries or businesses, be them big or small, are to be found. Therefore, it is going to be a challenge for me to find a company that really employs “many” (depending on how one chooses to define “many” though) people. So, what I am going to do here is to talk about a company which employs the highest number of people of all the companies we have in our town.\n\nThe company, I am talking about here, is a Textile Manufacturing Company. This textile industry is primarily concerned with the production of yarn, and cloth, as well as the subsequent design or manufacturing of clothing and their distribution. The raw materials, used in the company can be natural or synthetic, depending on the demands and requirements of the customers.\n\nEven though the company initially started to manufacture and operate on a small scale with a rather limited number of staffs, its operation grew rapidly because of the high demands for its finished products. Today, with more than 20 different kinds of machines, known as woollen mill machines, thread winding machines, Bleaching/Dyeing Machines, Scutching Machines,  Carding Machines, Spinning Machines and Yarn Gassing Machines, this textile company employs about at least a couple of hundreds of employees. Both male and female staffs work for this company, and they certainly do a great job to contribute to the local economy of my home town. By the way, most workers at this company are mostly unskilled or semi-skilled, and therefore, they are not really that qualified other than having a high school diploma.\n\nAnyway, even though, I am happy for the fact that this textile company is in my hometown, I wouldn’t really work there because neither I have any knowledge about this industry nor I am interested in this kind of working environment. Besides, the jobs at this company don’t really pay well, and given how much I earn at my current job, I don’t really think that I would be interested to work here at this time."

This is a chair manufacturing company and it has been manufacturing chairs for a long time in Greece. The company employs a good number of local people from the city to manufacture various types of chairs and other accessories to decorate chairs and tables in my hometown. This is a smart cue card topic and I am really happy to have this.  \n\nAround 900 people work here and most of them are workers. In fact, the job of manufacturing chair involves a huge number of hands to complete the process. Almost all the people of this locality are involved in producing chairs and they work around the day in the company factory. The majority of the people belong to the working class while some of them are working as high officials in the company. Actually, the area I live in is densely populated and most of the people are not that much educated. As a result, they are unable to manage a higher job for them.\n\nHigh school graduation is a must to get a job with this company and with higher education, anyone can apply for some other positions than that of the worker. But if someone can show some extraordinary skills, educational barriers are relaxed for them. The authority employs them without a second thought and considers them as the asset for the company. The salary offered by this company is also higher and everyone working here is pleased.  \n\nI would be interested to work here if I get a chance. Actually, all the works are equal and contribute to building society. So, I do consider the job of a chair company worker is respectable. Moreover, the benefits of this company are also attractive and everyone loves their job here. I am currently doing my bachelor degree in Business Administration and would love to get a relevant administrative job in this company."

But, here, in my discussion, the fruits, I am talking about, is not metaphorical, but rather the “real fruits”- the fruits of our mango garden. Actually, I and my family had some empty piece of land, and we all had decided that we would grow a mango garden on that unused land about 3 years ago. So, my father and I, together with some hired workers, we got into our business and finished planting about 100 trees.\n\nIt was a long and tiring work process, but finally, we were lucky to get it done within a month. After preparing our garden, all we could do was to wait for its trees to grow and eventually produce some fruits. Of course, we didn’t expect our mango trees to produce any fruits before 3 or 4 years, after planting them, but I guess that my family got lucky as mango started to show up in our garden in less than 3 years of time. By the way, when the mangoes actually started to show up on the trees of our garden, I was living in another city as I was working there. So, my father called me over my phone and gave me the good news.\n\nAnyway, after learning the news from my father, I felt really happy and excited that the fruits (speaking literally here) of our hard works were finally showing up. In fact, I couldn’t wait to visit the garden as soon as I heard it, but I just couldn’t do that because of my job. So, I just thanked the Almighty lord and kept waiting until the fruits were fully grown up and ripe."

Of course, we can all debate as to which invention is useful to people to what extent, but that would not probably get us anywhere. Having said that, I would like to move forward with our cue card topic of discussion, which is to talk about an invention that is useful to us.\n\nThe invention, I would like to talk about, is known to virtually everybody around us as a “smartphone”.  But, I like to call this invention “the jack of all trades” since it has been designed to do all kinds of intelligent things – things which are badly needed to carry our modern civilisation forward in an effective manner.\n\nConsidered as the “8th wonder of the world” by many in this world, a smartphone can be described as a cellular telephone with an integrated computer system, and other features not originally associated with telephones, such as an operating system, web browsing, and the ability to run software applications, just to name a few. And based on this “computer-centric” definition, many people even call it a “portable mini-computer” which is used by people to make and receive phone calls and text messages, take, show, and store pictures and video, browse the Internet, as well as send and receive e-mail. It is also used for location navigation with its GPS (Global Positioning System) feature, as well as record and play audio and music.\n\nAnyway, the first smartphone was invented by the world-renowned multinational technological company called “IBM” in 1992, and the name of the first smartphone was “Simon”.\n\nWell, just like everybody else, I also use this wonderful, little, flat and rectangular-shaped machine, called “smartphone”, mainly to communicate with other people. I also use it to browse the Internet, check my emails, take pictures and watch videos once in a while. Besides, given how convenient it is to carry with me, together with many other functionalities and features, it offers, I consider this wonderful invention to be very useful to me. After all, there is no other machine like a smartphone."

    "Answer": "The invention of the automobile was one of the greatest inventions in the world. This invention has helped change society and enhance people's lifestyle to a great extent. In fact, without the support of the automobile, this is impossible to travel. The mass production of the automobile was a great gift to the humankind. This is a great cue card topic for me and I will explain this invention in brief.\n\nThe very first automobile was founded in 1886. A German named Karl Benz materialized the idea. Later the commercialization of automobile was done in the early part of the 20th century. Before this period, it was a luxury mode of transportation for the higher class of society. With the initiatives of Henry Ford, the automobile became a standard mode of transportation for all types of people and based on the idea, some other industries also grew up rapidly.\n\nSince the invention, the automobile has been playing an important role for all classes of people. Distance is no longer a barrier for people now. They can move from one place to another within a short time. Earlier, before the invention of the automobile, people had to travel on feet and it took a long time to reach their destinations. But with the help of automobile, they can now reach in their intended places smoothly and accomplish their respective tasks safely. At present, automobiles have become cheaper and they are manufactured in various countries of the world.\n\nThis is also useful to me. I frequently use it, particularly the public transports to move into different parts of the city. In fact, if there is a shortage of vehicles on the streets, the commoners are to suffer a lot. I also had some bitter experiences regarding this issue. So, it is of great benefit to me."

So, I guess that it is fair to say that I had already developed some sort of objective and logical understanding of the world around me, which also meant that I knew that what I liked or preferred. And, one such thing, which I really liked, was to swim.\n\nIn fact, I loved swimming so much that it would be almost impossible for my parents to keep me at home during the summer vacation as I would make any kind of excuse to get out of home and swim. Anyway, by that age, even though I managed to swim in all kind of waters, be it a pond, lake or a large river, I never swam in an ocean, and so I asked my father to take me to a sea to swim in it. Not to mention, my father was kind enough to take to me the sea and let me swim in it all day. By the way, I would never forget the experience of viewing underneath the ocean and viewing all kinds of fishes and stones while swimming in it. Besides, taking pictures with a group of foreign visitors, who taught me how to be good swimmer, was just an amazing experience.\n\nAnyway, as I come to think of this experience, the first thing, I feel, is that I was so lucky to have such an understanding and caring father who took to pain to travel almost 600 kilometres just to offer me an opportunity to swim in an ocean. Besides, I also feel that if I didn’t go swimming in that ocean, I would never experience the vastness of an ocean with my little eyes."

He was a teen but rode on bicycles like an adult.\n\nAfter riding for a couple of days behind my brother, I wanted to learn to ride it myself. My brother, Jim, did not hesitate to teach me the riding. Initially, he explained how the bicycle worked and took me to take the rider seat. I fell on the ground several times and Jim instructed me to keep the balance. In the first phase, Jim used to control the bicycle from behind so that I do not fall on the ground and gradually I improved in riding the bicycle. Later, Jim allowed me to ride the bicycle alone.   \n\nIt was a nice experience for me. I know how to ride a bicycle and even I can drive a car now. Jim is my instructor in this case too. In fact, as an older brother, Jim cared for me too much and helped me greatly in learning the riding and driving. So, I am grateful to him. If he would not take the initiatives in my childhood, I would not have become a driver in a true sense."

    "Answer": "I have thought of doing a number of things at some points of my life, but they always have vanished from my mind suddenly just as they suddenly appeared. But, today I would like to talk about something which I have always wanted to do, and which never vanished from the time it ever crossed my mind.\n\nThis “thing” which I have always wanted to do is to write and publish a storybook that contains stories for children. By the way, I have held this wish in my heart from my high school days when I started to read some great children’s stories.\n\nNow, of course, one may be tempted to think that it shouldn’t really be that difficult to write a book and publish it, but as far as I have understood, it can be a rather difficult thing to do. In fact, I have failed to put together the stories so many times before that I feel like I need some sort of miracle to finish it anytime soon.\n\nOf course, setting aside that “miraculous” help, I haven’t managed to publish such a book, mainly because I couldn’t give enough of my time and efforts to finish the work. Besides, I rather took a casual approach to write this book instead of following some professional approaches and plans. These plans may include learning more about how to add “meat” in my stories. In other words, I should take a more professional approach in writing good dialogues, as well as becoming more descriptive in rolling out the plots of the stories in a free-flowing fashion. Besides, I am also going to read some more great children’s stories to understand how the “main” character in a story becomes effectively distinct from the rest of the characters.\n\nFinally, I should also be adept to creating more suspense and drama in my stories so that the readers, which I believe would be primarily children, of my stories remain naturally engaged to the stories until they finish reading them besides learning something from each story. So, please wish me luck so that I can finally finish writing my book and publish it!"

    "Answer": "I want to play the guitar. In fact, this is a hobby that I have been nurturing since my childhood. Unluckily, I was unable to learn to play this musical instrument completely. I had tried several times to learn guitar playing in full fledge but could not manage everything together. But I know how to play it. This is a great candidate task card topic and it reminds me of my unfulfilled aspiration.   \n\nI would like to play the guitar in my leisure hours. Besides, I also crave to play this instrument before going to bed. It will help me to get relaxed with the tunes. Moreover, I want to play the guitar when I am alone. I want to listen to the tones of nature and make them real through the guitar strings. I also desire to amaze my friends and relatives by playing the guitar, particularly those who have discouraged me from learning it.    \n\nInitially, I have a plan to start playing the guitar for myself and then I will start playing for the others. But I also need to learn the guitar playing techniques perfectly. While playing in a function if I forget to play or strike on the wrong string, it would be defaming for me. So, I want to know about guitar playing more before making the decision to play it either in public or privately.  \n\nI did not have the chance to practice playing the guitar so far. I had to be busy with my academic activities and now I am a bit relaxed for the next three months. So, I want to utilize the moments in learning to play the guitar."

I think that George Henley is one of the most helpful persons I have ever met, and today I would tell you how he has helped me with my work as a good colleague.\n\nEven though I am calling George as my coworker in a more general sense, he was actually more like a mentor to me since he was way more senior to me, not only in terms of age but also considering his experience. But, neither of his age nor his experience prevented him to take me under his assuring wings to train me as a future Lead Business Development Strategist of my company.\n\nNow, please understand that being a successful Business Developer in a very competitive industry like “travel and tourism” is not an easy thing by any stretch of the imagination, but George taught me all the tricks to become one within a rather short period of time.  He taught me many things at work, including the tricks to identifying rising business opportunities and building long term business relationship with the prospects. But what has helped me the most, in the long run, was his tips on becoming a good and confident communicator under any circumstances. In fact, it is because of this great communication and presentation skill of mine, I was offered the role of a Senior Communication Specialist at my current company where I am enjoying each and every minute of my responsibilities as the “face” of my company.\n\nWell, I feel like, with the help of George Henley, I have managed to rediscover my skills and abilities as a communication specialist. Besides, the confidence, which I received from George, has made me become a better and more efficient person, not only in my professional life but also in my personal life. I mean, for an introvert person like me, managing to talk confidently with some of the finest and brilliant business minds in the industry of my country is no small feat by any means."

He is a man of letters and skilled in various arts. He also loves to take part in social activities and assist his students in needs. I think this is a nice cue card topic for me and I would like to thank you for this.\n\nWhen I was not getting the supervisor for my thesis, Mr David extended his helping hand. He allowed me to make him my supervisor in the thesis. Accordingly, I started taking suggestions and directives about the thesis which were really necessary for me. In fact, without support from Mr David, the dean of the faculty, I would not have submitted the thesis in due time. He helped me always with the necessary information and valuable directives.  \n\nI was told to select a subject for the thesis and I picked the topic – Old History of the European Continent. History was my favourite and I thought that I would be able to complete the work in due time and smoothly. But I stumbled in each of the steps after the topic selection. I could not manage the necessary resources for exploration and I also did not get my supervisor who would guide me through the process. All the professors were engaged and then Mr David told me to write his name on the space for the supervisor in the thesis form.   \n\nHonestly, I felt lucky when I got him as my supervisor. Moreover, we had a very good understanding and I got all the required supports from him. He was like an affectionate father to me. The moments under his supervision were nice and I finally made a good result."

    "Answer": "My friends tell me that I am a bit too picky in choosing a restaurant or food places where I would like to sit and enjoy my food. In fact, I hardly ever give any compliments, as most of my friends say, to a restaurant even when I like it. But, today, I would like to talk about a time when I didn’t only like the services of a restaurant but also offered my compliments to them.\n\nIt happened about a few years ago when I was visiting a very popular tourist spot in my country to spend my annual holidays for a week. By the way, it was a very crowded place, and the restaurants there remain very busy as long as they keep open. So, I was very much under the impression that it would be very difficult for the restaurants there to maintain even a reasonably good standard of services, let alone some world-class services since too many customers visit them. But, I was proved wrong when I visited a Japanese restaurant to try “sukiyaki” (a one-pot dish of mutton, vegetables, and tofu cooked with a sweet soy sauce broth in a shallow cast iron pot).\n\nIn fact, from the moment of entering the restaurant to finishing the food, it was a magical experience that swept my heart unlike ever before. The collection of cutleries, glassware, serving dishes, and other items, used for decoration purposes, at the restaurant were just too exquisite and elegant to handle. The food was prepared and cooked to perfection, and the staff there had all the tricks up in their sleeves to make me feel as if I was their only customer to serve.\n\nNeedless to say, after visiting that restaurant, I had no other choice but to compliment them for their world-class services since there wasn’t a thing that I could complain about. Besides, I felt that a person can’t possibly expect anything else more from a restaurant when it does everything right to treat its customer as their only special guest. I am so glad that I actually visited that restaurant."

    "Answer": "It was in the city of Paris where I went to take supper with two of my friends and the service I got from this restaurant was excellent. It was really nice experience and I received a very good service from the restaurant authority. In fact, it was a wonderful restaurant that served the best foods with the best service I have ever seen. I like this candidate task card and will describe the event in brief now.  \n\nDuring my travel to Paris last year, I received the service. I went to Paris to assess the possibilities of my product expansion. I deal with readymade garments and wanted to expand my business in the local market of Paris. So, I needed a pre-assessment before making the move. I flew to Paris from Malaysia and stayed with one of my childhood friends who had been living in the city for the past few years. He inspired me with the plan and accordingly I also expressed my interest. One day, we moved to have our supper out of the home and experienced this amazing event.   \n\nThe most important thing about the service was promptness. The restaurant waiters served us within a short time after we placed the orders. Moreover, the foods were delicious and appeared fresh. The cooking method was completely different which made the foods tastier. As a result, we all were amazed at the food quality and taste. The seating arrangement was different too. The reasonable price was another remarkable issue there. They organized the inner part of the restaurant in a simply attractive way.\n\nI felt honoured after receiving the service from the restaurant. But I admit that the other restaurants are also hospitable but not like this one. The restaurant manager appeared while we were dining and asked about the quality of the food, service etc. and it showed how much they cared."

    "Answer": "I love children, but loving them and spending some time with them aren’t necessarily the same things. So, when I was asked to look after “Liam”, the little 5 years old son of my friend, about a few months ago because his parents were going to visit a relative at a hospital, I was looking for an “exit”.\n\nBut, my friends were being stubborn and assured me that I would do just fine with their little boy since they were going to be away only for a few hours. So, despite my reluctance, I finally agreed to look after Liam while desperately hoping that he would cooperate with me.\n\nBy the way, Liam was a typical 5-year-old boy, who was full of life, and who loved to have fun as much as possible whether he was alone or with his friends. But, I was neither a friend nor any close relative to him, so he just didn’t quite know how to relate to me.\n\nThinking of this rather uncomfortable situation, I asked the little boy whether he would like to spend his time at home or go outside with me. The boy naturally opted to choose the latter option since the little boy very much liked outdoors. So, I took him to a nearby park where he would be able to play and swing with other children of his age. Once he got exhausted by playing with the other children, I asked him whether he wanted to walk with me a little at the park or visit a shop to grab some of his favourite ice creams. Not to mention, of course, Liam wanted to enjoy ice creams. By the time, he finished his ice cream, it was already getting dark. So we decided to go back to my friend’s place.\n\nAnyway, after spending the time with the little boy, I felt relieved because I didn’t really have to try too hard to keep him happy. Besides, I also felt that little children could be way more reasonable and rational (if treated rightly) than we would like to give them credit for."

She came to pay a visit to me and my family members. And so, she brought all the family members including her husband and children. It was a gala event for me to have the kids, especially the little one. This is an interesting cue card topic for me. I would like to thank you for this nice topic.\n\nThe child was my nephew. Though the baby was only four, he started to talk like the adult people. Moreover, he was smart and intelligent. And he asked some interesting questions which I failed to answer. His inquisitiveness was an admiring issue to me. I have never seen such a baby talk like this. So, I shared all my knowledge with the baby to satisfy his hunger of curiosity.   \n\nI spent time with this child for some reasons. I am often unable to spend time with my family members for the nature of my job. I am a travel guide and remain busy round the week. It is really inconvenient for me to manage time for my family and let alone the relatives. When I get them at my home, it was a joyous event for me and I tried to enjoy their company, especially the child.\n\nWe did lots of things together. Watching cartoon is one of the remarkable matter. The little boy knew all the names of the cartoon characters and stories. The baby also had some mock fights with me. We took bath together in rain in the next day and had also made much more fun stuff. It was a great experience."

    "Answer": "What does it really mean to be polite? Well, as far as I am concerned, I would call a person most “polite” when he shows “consideration for others” under all circumstances and never behaves harshly to hurt someone. Today, I would like to talk about one such person who never falls short in showing consideration for others, and who also seems to be the most polite person in my eyes.\n\nHis name is Nazir Shah, and he is a distant uncle of mine. Being passionately called as “Shah Uncle” by the young people like me in and around my neighbourhood, Nazir Shah could easily be considered as one of the most polite persons by his friends and foes alike.\n\nWell, on second thought, talking about his foes, I don’t think that Shah uncle has any. In fact, since the time I have known him, which could be as long as 15 plus years, I have hardly even seen him without a smiley face as if no sadness or hardships ever touch him. When I asked him in the past as to why he always liked to keep a smiley face, he simply told me that it just wasn’t “polite” to talk a person with a sad or serious face. Shah uncle doesn’t just like to keep a smiley face but also likes to help others even if it means that he has to go out at 3:00 in the morning. In fact, I have seen him spending many nights at the hospitals trying to help or accompany the distressed people and families. Do you need a ride to some places? Just ask Shah Uncle, and he would take you there even if it means being late for his work.\n\nAnyway, I think that Shah uncle is the most polite person, I have ever come across because he is the only person, I have seen so far, who doesn’t mind accepting his own loss in trying to help others. Besides, what makes Shah uncle the most polite person in my eyes is that he never likes to judge people or push them for anything, no matter how “horribly” they behave."

He is kind and loves to meet with people and help them in their needs. Though he needs to suffer for his politeness, he is unable to give up his natural habit. This is a nice cue card task for me and I am happy to have the chance of describing him.\n\nI came to know about John at my university. He is the only person who came to my help when I was in a dire need of support. In fact, I lost my class diary and a pen on my way to the university and it was John who helped me with his own pen and shared his notes. Later, I came to know that he had a single pen that he gave to me and he did not write a line on his exercise book for the want of a pen. When other students were busy with them, he came forward for my help selflessly. It was his politeness that made me amazed.\n\nJohn is polite in every sense. He never makes any rude remarks to anyone while others find it interesting to make statements on other's troublesome situations. Moreover, when someone is in distress, it is John who moves ahead before everyone else. His speeches are well constructed and he always carefully tries not to hurt anyone with his speech. He is unable to say something against any rude remarks to him and remains silent in these situations. He is well-known both for his gentle nature and talent.\n\nI am highly glad to have this person on my friend list. In fact, he is a model for everyone to learn courtesy. He never breaks his promises and makes promise considering his ability. So, I like him very much for his politeness and other qualities."

So, I'll just go ahead and talk about one of those many goals that I am yet to achieve.\n\nThis particular goal, that I am yet to achieve like many others, is to buy a small but beautiful house near the ocean in my country. It would be very much like a second home where I would be able to stay every once in a while when I am on holidays or have any kind of break from my work.\n\nI wanted to achieve this goal, of course, because I have always loved the view of the ocean, and there is no better to way to keep enjoying it than having your own place, close to the ocean. Of course, many would argue that I could always stay at a hotel near an ocean and enjoy its beautiful view from up close, but that wouldn’t exactly allow me the freedom or peace of mind of staying at my own place, would it?\n\nAnyway, when I initially thought of achieving this goal, I thought that I would be able to do it rather easily. But, as more and more time has passed, I also have started to doubt my ability to achieve this goal, at least not before my retirement. I know that I am sounding a bit pessimistic here, but the changing circumstances in life, such as security of job and income, suggesting that even if I am ever to achieve this goal, I will have to make a lot of sacrifice in life.\n\nAnyway, I am yet to achieve this goal, primarily because I just don’t have enough money yet. Besides, I have to live quite far away from the ocean due to my profession, and so, it is not always easy for me to travel that long distance to find a property of my choice."

The most important obstacle was that I could not manage the time to learn the photography course completely. Besides, I do not have that much extra time for the improvement of photography. But this is a nice cue card task for me and I am feeling lucky to have it.\n\nI wanted to be a photographer for many reasons. The most important thing about being a photographer is that you can capture nice moments. Moreover, you can have the chance to play with light. You can select frames, objects, modes and do have a nice composition with them. When all the things are combined, the photo becomes a masterpiece. They are enjoyable to look at and becomes memories forever. Moreover, this is a great task to capture the moments that will never come back again in life. Considering all the matters, I wanted to achieve this goal.\n\nCertainly, I can achieve this goal. I do have the chances to become a photographer. But for reaching the goal, I will need to do some specific things. Most importantly, I will have to manage time to complete a photography course. In line with that, I will need a camera for practical lessons. Another important thing is needed for the purpose that I forgot to mention before. I will need a skilled trainer or a reputed photography teaching school for learning the skill.\n\nHonestly, I do not want to learn photography for any financial gain. Rather, I want to learn it for my mental satisfaction. Besides, there are some chances to participate in many specialized conferences of photographers which also will make me enriched with photographic knowledge."

So, it is fair to suggest that whether there is a swimming place inside my town or outside of it, I am most probably aware of it. So, today, I would like to talk about one of these swimming places which I also like to visit from time to time along with other people.\n\nThis swimming place, I am talking about, is located outside of my town, and I go to enjoy swimming there at least once a week, if not more. But, it is not a swimming pool, but rather it is a large lake that stretches about half a kilometre. So, it is fair to say that it is large enough to accommodate a huge number of swimmers at a time, so naturally, all kinds of people, both young and adults, visit this place for the purpose of swimming, from both inside and outside of the city.\n\nThis lake is surrounded by lots of trees and greenery, which is visited by all kinds of beautiful birds. Besides, both sides of the lake are nicely curved with brick-made structures and beautiful trees. On top of that, the sandy beaches on both sides of the lake are well spread and offer a nice arrangement to help people sit comfortably and enjoy their time in all kinds of weather. By the way, even though it is opened for all kinds of public, it is mostly visited by young people, especially, when they are on holidays or their schools are closed.\n\nAnyway, people visit this swimming place, primarily because it has a lot of empty space as well as beautiful nature around it to help people enjoy some fresh air and mother nature. Besides, the water in the lake is clean and clear. The shallow depth of this lake is also one of the major factors, which attracts a lot of swimmers since people don’t feel scared to swim in it. Finally, people love to visit this place because it has nice restaurants and snack shops around it to help people relax and feel comfortable."

    "Answer": "Swimming is a very good activity and provides a wide number of benefits to the swimmers. So, I often go for swimming at Keller swimming pool near my hometown in Paris. The place is located in the outskirt of the city of Paris. This is a very good place indeed to swim at any time of the day. The swimming pool has a couple of pool ranges. This is a nice cue card topic for me and I am feeling lucky to have it.\n\nThis is a place which is opened to the public. There is a large area made for swimming purposes only. It was built in the 1960s and served the nation for a long time. It was renovated in 2008. The renovation was necessary for some purposes. The water used in this pool is filtered in several layers. The pool is also preferred by the team of swimmers as well.    \n\nThis is a nice swimming pool and comes with a wide number of facilities. So, it is a preferable place for all types of swimmers. But this is a heaven for the early risers. Most of the people who want to have swimming early part of the morning come here to serve the purpose. The luxurious changing rooms are one of the attractions for them. Moreover, the water is filtered with ozone instead of chlorine and disinfected with some other process. So, this is safe for the kids as well. Some of the kids come here to swim either with their parents or with their team of swimmers.     \n\nSwimming is really helpful to maintain sound health. At present, the people of Paris are more health-conscious than in the past. So, a notable number of them gather here for swimming purpose and they enjoy swimming."

It all happened about 10 years ago when I had to wait for my first computer to arrive.\n\nIt was the first year of my happy university student life, and I was living at a university dormitory with another fellow year-mate of mine, who had his own computer. As I could see my roommate doing all sorts of cool things on his computer, I also wanted to have my own computer and asked my father to buy one for me. But, my father told me to wait for at least a couple of weeks as he was terribly busy to buy me a computer at that time. So, all I could do at that time was to wait for at least two weeks before I could get my computer.\n\nNeedless to say, two weeks' waiting period at that time was probably the longest as well as the most exciting waiting period of my life. Anyway, as I was waiting all those times, I was discussing with my roommate about how to use my computer and what other cool and interesting things I would be able to do with it. My computer eventually was delivered to me at my dormitory after two weeks by a courier serviceman, and as soon as I got it, I felt like I was floating in the moon in joy and happiness.\n\nAnyway, as I was done with my initial excitement and all that after having my computer, I immediately asked my roommate to set up the computer for me since I wasn’t too sure about how to do it. And once the computer was all set on my desk, I started to work on it like there is no tomorrow. In fact, I kept playing with my computer till the late night, and I stopped torturing my computer only after my roommate laughingly told me to give it a little rest and start over again the next day."

In fact, I received one of the most important gifts of my life on that date. My parents wanted to make me happy and so, they gave me a very special gift marking Christmas. This is a pretty nice cue card for me, and I am happy with this.\n\nThe moments were filled with anxiety. I tried to focus on several things but failed. At first, I took a book right after supper. But I failed to focus on the book. Then I moved to play some computer games, and it was a failure as well. Later, I tried to concentrate on social websites and it turned in a fruitless effort too. In fact, I was too much excited and could not concentrate on anything at all. The moments turned longer and I could not enjoy the things I was doing.  \n\nActually, my younger brother told me that I will receive something special from parents and thus I became excited. But I could not share my emotions with the other people fearing if I do not get the gift. Gradually, my dad came to me and said that he wanted to tell me something. He was serious and I was afraid. But suddenly he smiled and gave the gift to me.\n\nI was too happy after receiving the package. The gifts were - a leather bag, a pair of sunglasses, a perfume from my preferred brand and a nicely decorated dress. Everything was packed in a single package. I jumped out with joy after unveiling the gifts and thanked them a lot for the gifts. I am using the products and grateful indeed to my parents."

    "Answer": "I am more like a casual person when it comes to dresses. Of course, different people have different ideas about being casual. But, as far as I am concerned, my idea of being casual is to wear blue jeans and a light t-shirt with a collar, which also happens to be my favourite dress, by the way. So, today I would like to talk about this favourite dress of mine which I like to wear, well, pretty much all the times.\n\nNow, of course, just because I said that I like to wear it all the times, it doesn’t necessarily mean that I do wear it all the times. Rather, I meant to say that I like to wear this favourite dress of mine as often as I could unless, of course, there is any bar or restriction on wearing them. So, if you ask me when precisely I like to wear them, I would say that I like to wear them when I am visiting any friend’s place, doing my groceries and shopping,  going to a stadium to enjoy a good game or picking up my little nephew from his elementary school. Besides, I like to wear them even when I am going to attend a party, casual or not, at some restaurants or party centres. So, I guess, it is fair to say that I wear them every day unless I am attending a formal meeting with my boss at my work, and other than that meeting thing, I always go to the work in my blue jeans and light colour t-shirt. \n\nAnyway, this particular dress is so special to me, primarily because they are easy to wear and keep me relaxed and comfortable in all kinds of weather unless, of course, it is too cold outside. I prefer them so badly also because I don’t really have to try too hard to keep them reasonably clean and tidy, no matter what I do or where I go. Finally, I find them so special because I don’t really have to worry about wasting my time in ironing them even when I go outside."

I have been using this type of dress for a long time and it has become my trademark that I will wear a T-shirt even for a formal occasion. This cue card task appears smart and I am enjoying to answer it.\n\nI usually wear T-shirts when I am out of the home. There are people who like to be formal in their dress code. But I am a bit different from them. I do not like to wear shirts or formal pants or any formal attire. Rather I prefer to have T-shirts and jeans which give me comforts. In fact, I feel uncomfortable with the other types of dresses. So, whenever I need to move out for any of my tasks, I wear T-shirts.\n\nFrequently I wear T-shirts to meet my purposes. Actually, this has become a fashion for me and I cannot do without a T-shirt. When I move to my college class early in the morning, I wear it. If someone invites me in the evening to attend any party, I need a T-shirt for me. Further, when I am out of home for any other purposes like meeting my relatives, friends, or for any other purposes, I will be seen wearing a T-shirt. I wear it round the week.\n\nWearing a T-shirt is special to me for many reasons. The most important thing is the comfortability. A T-shirt is the most comfortable dress in the entire world. They are available in various colour and design. The fabrics are of a high standard and easy to clean. For all the reasons, the T-shirt is my favourite dress."

    "Answer": "No matter how much we dislike going to crowded places, the necessity of life actually compels us to do so. And it was out of this very necessity of life, I also had to visit one crowded place – I mean, really crowded – and today, I would like to share that story with you.\n\nThis crowded place was one of the most popular shopping malls in my country. Being located in one of the most populous metropolia of my country, it naturally attracts a huge number of people from the city itself on a regular basis. However, it becomes even more crowded when a very significant number of people flock into this place from other cities nearby, especially, during the weekend.\n\nAnd it was during a weekend when I visited this place with a couple of friends in order to buy a special birthday gift for a very close friend of ours. By the way, we had already visited a few other shopping places to buy a perfect gift for our friend, but unfortunately, we couldn’t really find anything of our liking and hence visiting the crowded shopping mall.\n\nAnyway, after arriving at the shopping mall, we noticed that all the entrances were packed with visitors, so we literally had to push people to make our way into the mall. There were so many shops in the mall, and yet, they all were filled with hundreds of customers to buy their merchandises at once as if the products were going out of style. Besides, the noise was so deafening there that we (me and my friends) actually had shouted at each other to communicate even though, we were probably only a couple of feet away from each other.\n\nAnyway, after visiting that crowded place, my first impression was that I wanted to get out of it as soon as possible. I was also under the impression that some people visited that crowded place just to spend some of their lazy times, which shouldn’t have happened. However, I also felt happy and relieved, knowing that we at least found what we were looking to buy for our birthday boy."

    "Answer": "The Chinatown is located in Manhattan in New York. This is one of the most crowded places in the country and a good number of people visit there. This is mostly a neighbourhood in Manhattan and surrounded by some other residential and commercial areas. This is also the home of Chinese people living in New York. It appears as a nice candidate task card for me. I will talk about this place in a brief.   \n\nI visited this place a couple of months ago. I went there to meet one of my Chinese mates and greet her on her birthday. She studies marketing with us at university. It was difficult for me to seek out the location at the beginning. The entire area was crowded with lots of people and the majority of them were Chinese. They were speaking in their own language while some of them were speaking English as well. The shops and the sellers were interesting.\n\nI went there with Jim, Silvia, Blake, David, and Rocky. In fact, we were invited to the birthday party of our Chinese friend Chunhua. She invited us to attend the party and after her demands, we went there. It was a trouble to find out the location. All the places appeared similar to us and getting the right holding was extremely difficult for us. But finally, we reached Chunhua’s place. It was a nice evening.  \n\nThe feelings were mixed. In fact, it was the very first visit to any Chinese home. So, I could not think of what to do or how to respond. Besides, travelling to the crowded place was another exciting event. I have not seen such a crowd before. People were everywhere and all of them were Chinese. At first, I was a bit anxious but gradually everything turned normal."

    "Answer": "People say that there are some people who are book smart while there are the others who are street smart. But, sometimes, I think that the street smart persons come handier than the others. After all, it was the street smart person, who gave me a clever solution to a problem, and this is his story.\n\nKyle and I attended the same school and the same classes. Kyle, a very street smart boy, didn’t really like to go to the school on a regular basis. Instead, he would rather like to roam around here and there with his friends – friends who were just as smart as him. As for me, I liked going to school and attending the classes, but what I never liked was to carry a load of books in my backpack from home to school and then to home again every day, either because I was physically weak or because I was a bit too lazy. But, whatever was that the reason, I was desperately trying to find a solution to this book carrying problem.\n\nSo, I asked Kyle for a solution, and in response, he simply told me to give him some money (that I had saved from my tiffin money). Then, he told me to wait for a couple of days. Up and until that point, I had no clue what his plan was with my money, but exactly after two days, Kyle handed me another set of school books and told me to keep them at my school locker. Apparently, he bought those books with my money, and the idea was that I would keep one set of the book at home and the other set at my school locker so that I wouldn’t really need to carry the books again from home to school and vice versa.\n\nAnyway, the solution was simply brilliant and very clever considering our age. It was smart also because it wouldn’t only help me save my breath, but would also save me the time to organize them at home. Besides, the solution also gave me ideas about what else I could have done with my saved up tiffin money."

    "Answer": "It was Mr Simpson who gave me a smart solution to a problem I was in. In fact, without his help, I would not have been able to get rid of the predicament. With his extraordinary intelligence, he helped me out and I am grateful to him. This is a very smart candidate task card and I am honoured to have it in my share. I will answer it in brief now.\n\nI was having trouble with my cell phone charging back up time. It was a trouble for me and I could not get the right power backup as I was supposed to get. Battery draining was a very common issue with this phone set. So, I had to remain worried about my mobile phone charging issue. I barely used the phone lest the charge is lost. But Mr Simpson advised me to follow some charge cycles and also asked me to change the phone charger. I never thought of the issue. And to my surprise, it worked very well.  \n\nMr Simpson is my neighbour and works as an IT expert at a local company. I have a good relationship with him and share my issues to get his valuable suggestions. Being an Android user, it is really hard when you have a phone and you cannot use it. I was experiencing the matter and I shared the fact with him to get some solutions. He asked me to change the charging adapter and also to install an application to complete charging cycle.\n\nIt was a clever solution indeed. In fact, I was planning to change my phone set. If I would not get the solution, I would have changed the phone within a couple of days. But following the instructions, I was able to get back a better battery backup."

    "Answer": "While there is no definitive definition – at least, a universal definition that I am aware of - of a happy marriage, the conventional wisdom suggests that when a couple gets along with each other just fine under any and all circumstances, we can duly consider that they have a happy marriage just like the marriage between my maternal uncle and his lovely wife. To me, they are the perfect happy couple.\n\nAnyway, talking about my uncle and aunt, they are not really some young couple as I have been seeing them for almost 25 years now. In fact, they have a couple of college-going children who also seem just as happy as their parents. As I have already mentioned earlier that I have known this couple since my early childhood, but very seldom have I seen them living separately from each other, like many other couples do out of anger or misunderstanding, or arguing with each other over any petty issues. Well, on second thought, forget about any argument over some petty issues, I have never even seen them arguing over any important issues.\n\nBy the way, my uncle and aunt are a very busy couple, as they both work outside, but they still somehow manage to go out every week to enjoy some lovely dinner, with or without their children, together. They even manage to invite some of their friends over to their house and enjoy their time over some snacks or coffee at least twice a week. Besides, I have also seen my uncle doing videos of my aunt while she is busy cooking some of her favourite dishes in her kitchen.\n\nAnyway, the description of the relationship between my uncle and aunt above itself provides more than enough evidence to suggest that my uncle and aunt indeed is a very happily married couple. But, if that’s not enough of evidence, the practice of exchanging gifts among each other at least every month, be it some simple flowers or some expensive perfumes, would definitely convince anybody about the happy marriage between my uncle and aunt."

    "Answer": "My parents are the happily married couple and in my opinion, they have the strongest bond I have ever seen. They are the iconic figure to me. People also admire them for their togetherness. They love to spend time together and never have quarrelled severely in their life so far. They are the evergreen couple to everyone around us. This cue card topic is nice and I love to answer it in brief.\n\nI know them from my birth. They are my mom and dad. I love them too much. They have cared for me and did a lot of things for me so far. But it took me a long time to know about them. After getting matured enough, I realized that they are a happy couple. They have been married for over 30 years and they have three children. I am the youngest one and the others are also established in their respective sectors. All of us respect them for their mutual understanding.\n\nThey spend most of the time together. My father works for the government and my mother is a homemaker. Earlier, my mother used to be a school teacher before marriage and she gave up the profession and started her homemaking. When my father returns home after office, he spends most of the remaining time with my mom. Sometimes, they go out for shopping, cinema, and other recreational activities together.\n\nThey are the happily married couple for some few reasons. The most important thing is that they have a mutual understanding. Before making any decisions, they plan together and implement the plan smoothly. Moreover, they are peace-loving people. And they have passed rainy days together but never got split in critical situations. Even sometimes, they wait for one another during regular meals. So, I think they are a perfectly happy couple in their life and I think marriage as a divine bonding as I have seen them live in harmony and joy together."

    "Answer": "As a student of business administration, I have learnt that “there is no free lunch”. In other words, there is no “free service”. But, still, sometimes we just get lucky as I did about a few years ago when I got some free service from a taxi driver.\n\nYes, I am talking about a free taxi ride service. Going forward with the story, about a few years ago, I had to spend a couple of days at one of the busiest cities of my country for professional reason, where getting public transportation during the peak business hours can be really challenging. So, I decided not to rely on public transportation (even though, the cost of using them was relatively much cheaper), and instead decided to ride a taxi in order to save my time.\n\nLuckily, I got to meet a very dependable and gentle taxi driver who incidentally happened to be from my hometown. So, as I introduced myself to him, he became really excited, learning that I hailed from the same town as did he, and tried his best to accommodate my request to transport me from one place to another in his taxi for the next couple of days. Anyway, after a couple of days, I was done with my work and needed to go back to my home. So, I called the taxi driver to drop me at the airport, but, when I was getting ready to pay him for the taxi ride for that day, he very politely refused to take the money, saying that it was a complimentary taxi service. He said that, after all, I was from the same town as him, and he was really glad to offer me free service.\n\nAnyway, I felt really glad that someone was being kind enough to offer me a free service just because he and I were from the same town. Besides, I also felt that it doesn’t really take much to relate to other people if we try to open up to others, just I did to that taxi driver by telling him that both of us were from the same town."

    "Answer": "I had to vaccinate my baby recently. Most importantly, it was a free service and I am really pleased with the service I received. My earlier experiences about vaccination were not that much good and I did not get the right service even after spending a large amount of money in the local hospital. It appears a great cue card task for me. I am happy to have it in my share and will explain the matter in brief here.  \n\nThe service was provided by a local vaccination provider. It was their responsibility to vaccinate newborn babies. But the parents had to take the babies to the vaccination centre. It was not possible for the volunteers to move in every home and vaccinate the babies. Rather, they asked the parents to come at the vaccination point on a specific date. Accordingly, I went there at the present date to vaccinate my baby boy.   \n\nI took the service for some reasons. The most important thing about the service is that I needed that for my son. Without the vaccines, the babies could develop serious diseases that cannot be prevented in their adulthood. They have to suffer a lot and even may die. So, it is a must to take the vaccination service. Besides, the government provides its support to such services so that the citizens need not pay for the vaccines. Considering all the matters, I had to take the service.\n\nI felt satisfied. In fact, this is my right as a citizen to get such services from the government. I also felt lucky that I could vaccinate my baby and without any hassles. I also felt grateful to the government that it is performing its duty sincerely and caring for the citizens it gets taxes from."

    "Answer": "Thank you for such an interesting topic as I do know about a few popular swimming places in my country, and today, I would be more than happy to talk about one of them in as much details as possible.\n\nThis popular swimming pool, I am talking about, is popularly known as “Dhaka University Swimming Pool”. Located in the Dhaka University campus, at the opposite of “Curzon Hall”, even though, this swimming pool was initially built for the students of Dhaka University, today it is open to all public.\n\nThere are two swimming pools: one is about 15 feet deep and has a large area. This swimming pool is used by the “experts” who want to practice diving. The other swimming pool is about 8 feet deep and relatively smaller. But, of course, both swimming pools are used by the swimming lovers to enjoy their time, especially, during the summer days.\n\nFilled with crystal clear water and surrounded by some beautiful trees, these swimming pools attract all kinds of people and professionals, both young and adults, from all over the city to help them relax and spend some quality time by swimming with their friends and families. Many little children can be also seen here, trying to learn swimming with the help of their parents.\n\nAnyway, while this swimming pool remains busy throughout the entire year, it is during the weekend in the summertime that it becomes even more crowded, be it in the day time or evening time. In fact, it becomes so crowded during the summertime that people actually have to wait to swim there. By the way, people can swim in this swimming pool from morning to late evening.\n\nTo conclude, this is a great place to go to do swimming, primarily because it has a nice environment. There are proper safety and security measures here, so people of all ages, especially the children, can enjoy swimming there. Besides, this place also has a happy atmosphere where people like to laugh and chat with each other in a rather friendly manner. In fact, I also go swimming in this place."

This is a great place for swimming and a notable number of people come here for the purpose. This is also a favourite place for professional swimmers as well. The swimming lines are wide and spacious. I think this is a special cue card for me and I will answer the questions in brief now.   \n\nThis is a place where almost all types of people can pay a visit and swim. But some of the swimming lanes are reserved for special purposes. The local swimming academies have their own swimming lane here which the others cannot use. Besides, the swimming pool is also used by professional swimmers around the city. They come here for practice. Some of the locals also use the pool during the night time and in the early morning hours.   \n\nThis is a swimming pool opened to the public. So, every day a good number of people gather here for swimming. The pool is crowded during the weekends. The weeknights are also crowded too. The long and wide lines provide the best possible service for the swimmers. But on the other days, the swimming pool is crowded with swimmers who want to learn swimming. The depth and lengths are attractive and thus it has gained popularity among the locals.  \n\nThis is a good place to swim for many reasons. The most important thing is clean water. The authority is much careful about the cleaning issue and follows a couple of steps. No chemicals are used in the water for the swimmers' safety. A couple of lanes have made it convenient for everyone to swim here. Considering the grounds, this is a great place for swimming."

    "Answer": "There are a lot of café places where I live. So, I don’t really have to travel far whenever I feel like spending some quality time at a café. But, the other day, a couple of my friends asked me to visit a new café in the outskirt of my city, and today I would like to share that story with you.\n\nAs I have just mentioned, it is a new café, and so I was not really too sure about what to expect there. But, when I arrived there, I was in for a pleasant surprise as I found that the friendly management and staff there were eagerly waiting to greet us and other customers. By the way, it was indeed a nice café, as my friends had told me before, with a nice decoration inside.\n\nThe tables were nicely shaped with beautiful, cream colour table clothes on them. Each and every table maintained a safe distance from each other to offer all of its customers a sense of privacy. The flower vases on the tables added to the elegance of the café even more. Not to mention, the lighting system of the café was also very colourful that certainly helped create a rather mystical environment there. Besides, all around the café, everything looked very shiny and spotlessly clean. There wasn’t a single thing that I could find to complain about the café.\n\nTalking about the foods and drinks there, they were equally delicious and appetizing, especially, the strawberry-filled cheesecake and the garlic-roasted bread were simply outstanding. Besides, the cranberry fruit drinks tasted like they just came fresh from the garden!\n\nAnyway, I liked this café, mainly because it had a huge space inside it to accommodate just about everybody rather comfortably. Besides, the decoration inside the café was very gorgeous and contemporary to lighten up your mood. Finally, I liked the café also because they served some of the most delicious foods and snacks I had ever tasted."

The seating arrangement, the foods beverages, and other services were adorable. The coffee they served was hot and delicious. In fact, I am sure that the coffee maker was an experienced person and knew his job well. This is a wonderful candidate task card. I will describe the event now in brief.  \n\nThe café is located in the centre of Mumbai. Thus it is accessible from all parts of the city. To be more accurate, the café is located near the central bus depot in Mumbai. The place is known as Jehangir Boman Behram Rd and the café is on the front side of the road. This is a perfect place and always remains crowded. But the inner environment of the café is calm, quiet and spacious. It appears that the noise from outside is unable to enter inside the café.  \n\nThe café is popular for its special type of coffee. Besides, it also sells various types of light foods in the daytime. But crowds start gathering from the evening. It arranges for fresh barbeques with meat and fish, fried rice, paratha, vegetable curries and other types of local and foreign dishes. The price of the foods is also reasonable as well which is the other cause of getting popularity for this café. I took a barbeque with paratha there and really enjoyed them.  \n\nI like the café for some reasons. First of all, I am in love with the inner decoration and seating arrangement. The service is also fine and most importantly, it sells fresh foods. There are no rotten or wastes are sold. Considering everything, I like it very much."

    "Answer": "I have always been fascinated by the idea of moving to a new place or a new house. But, little did I know that one day my family would sell our old house and buy a new one because of moving to a new city.\n\nIt all happened about 15 years ago from now when my father decided to change his long time profession and move to a less crowded small town. Initially, of course, I wasn’t very much in favour of moving to a small town (because I actually loved living in a big city since I grew up there and everything was so familiar to me), but when my whole family, including my parents and elder siblings, explained to me about the benefits of living in a small town, I reluctantly agreed with them.\n\nBy the way, I wasn’t in favour of selling our old house either, because I really liked its design and size, but, again, my whole family convinced me otherwise by saying that they would need to sell the old house in order to get the additional cash for buying a new house. Anyway, now, it was time to visit the new city and look for our new house. So, my whole family, including the little me, travelled to the new city and started to look for a house, only to find out it wasn’t that easy to buy a new house as good as our old one. Finally, after a marathon try of one whole week, we luckily found a house that we could buy. Now, all was left to do was to just pack our luggage and old furniture and move into our newly-bought house.\n\nAnyway, moving to a new house, at a completely new and strange place, was a whole new experience for me – an experience which I was never really prepared for.

Before moving to this house, we were in Benin city in Nigeria. I liked the house in Abuja and it was well furnished and spacious than the former house in Benin City. This is a pretty nice cue card task for me and I will answer the other questions in brief.   \n\nWe moved to Abuja as my father was transferred to this city with his responsibilities on a government job for collecting revenue for the government. It was impossible for him to continue the office between the two cities. So, he shifted with the other family members in Abuja and arranged for a new home for us. We also were happy with the new home, particularly for the extended space.\n\nI moved with my parents and two other siblings. In fact, we were mentally prepared from the moment we heard that father got a transfer. In line with shifting the house, we also had to change our schools. It was really a trouble for us, especially for our father. Almost every year, he had to manage seats for us in a new school where he intended to shift. Besides, it was really expensive as well to move the furniture and other home appliances from one city to another.  \n\nInitially, I felt irritating to move house from one place to another. But after a couple of years, we all were habituated. But now I do not have any such problems as I am a university student now and live in the dormitory. My family is still living in Abuja and my dad will retire soon. So, I am feeling relaxed a bit now."

But, I certainly don’t enjoy talking to them as much as I enjoy talking to my grandmother.\n\nMy grandmother is almost 75 years “young”. Yes, she doesn’t really like being called “old”, and she, of course, has reasons for that. In fact, even at this 75 years of age, she pretty much has all her teeth, and she very seldom uses any glasses unless she has to read some really fine print. Of course, she sometimes complains about the joint pains on her body, but that hardly ever stops her from walking like a 40 years young and get her things done without any help from others around her.\n\nBy the way, I have found my grandmother to be very “conservative” when it comes to spending money, even though, she is considered to be a reasonably wealthy person since her husband (my grandfather) left a considerable amount of wealth for his wife before passing away. And because of this conservative approach of her in spending money, I have never seen her keeping more than just a few set of dresses. But, just because she doesn’t like spending money, it doesn’t mean that she keeps her dresses untidy or dirty. Rather, I have found her dresses to be always ironed and spotlessly clean. Anyway, since my grandmother lives with us, it is quite natural for me to see her and talk to her at least couple of times a day – once before going out to work and other time is before going to bed at night.\n\nAnyway, I enjoy talking to my grandmother, primarily because she is very soft-spoken. In fact, I have hardly ever found her to be cranky like other elderly people of her age. Besides, I also enjoy talking to her because she shares a lot of funny and interesting stories from her childhood and young days."

He is an intelligent and active man even in his 60s. Most of his stories are made from his real-life experiences when he served as a soldier in the army. So, I enjoy talking with this person and learn numerous invaluable lessons from each of the conversations. This is a great cue card task topic for me and I would like to thank you for this. I am glad to have it in my share.\n\nMy grandfather, Thomas Connor, was a brave soldier and served in the army for over 20 years. He was promoted to a higher rank of the army and got an early retirement for his vision impairment. But he looked very strong and smart with his official uniform. Still, he has a smart look with his glasses. He is able to drink a huge amount of beer at a time and loves to take part in outdoor activities.    \n\nI frequently meet him and when it is a weekend, I am glued to my grandfather round the day. In this time, I have nothing to do and the college is closed. Moreover, my grandfather also gets some spare moments to spend with the family. But I occupy the largest share of the moments from him. On a regular day, I do not have much time to spend with grandpa. I only wish him a good morning and leave for the college.\n\nI love talking with this person.

    "Answer": "My house is full of different kinds of furniture, that are laying there for ages, and that are also serving many purposes of my house. But, today, I would like to talk about a piece of furniture which is relatively new, and which I particularly find beautiful.\n\nThe furniture, I am talking about, is a large computer desk which my family has bought rather recently from a famous chain furniture store in my country. Even though it was primarily bought to use as a family computer desk, now we use it for practically all purposes, from ironing our clothes to eating our afternoon snacks. Not to mention, of course, the L-shape desk is large enough, not only to accommodate our big, old desktop but also to keep some of the best-looking flower vases that our house has.\n\nAnyway, to describe the computer desk, in a bit more details, it is a brownish and wooden (from oak tree) desk that have perfectly well-rounded corners. Its edges on all sides are curved very smoothly in order to render the desk a rather modern look overall. It's also very wide and deep, which gives us plenty of room, not only to place a computer, but also to do other things which I have already mentioned above. By the way, even though, originally the desk, which can be broken into pieces and assembled easily, had a rather expensive price tag, my family actually got to buy it on a discounted price. In fact, the desk costed us only a little over 200 US dollars, which also additionally included some beautifully-designed metal legs if we wanted to ever use them later on.\n\nAnyway, I find this particular piece of furniture beautiful, mainly because it looks very shiny as if it is just newly-bought. Besides, the particular piece of furniture blends in perfectly and naturally with the other household items inside the room in order to give it a rather elegant look."

In fact, the Statue of Liberty, located on the Liberty Island in New York, is one of the most impressive and wonderful sculptures in the whole world and attracts thousands of tourists every day from different parts of the world. This is a historical sculpture and was a gift from the French people to the USA marking the centennial of the liberty of the USA. I am thankful for this cue card topic and the remaining answer goes here.\n\nIt was made of copper. The structure of the statue was made with a combination of iron and copper. And it was sent to the USA by breaking down the entire statue into several parts. The design of the statue was done by Frederich Bartholdi while it was made by Gustave Eiffel himself who is also famous for the construction of the Eiffel Tower in France.\n\nThe statue is a symbolic one and the Lady Liberty has a nice look. The statue is also known as the Liberty Enlightening the World. The statue is in the form of a robbed woman who represents Libertas. Libertas was a Roman goddess. And here, the statue wears a crown on her head, holds a torch with her right hand above the head. She is also carrying a book in her left arm that contains the date of independence declaration of the USA. The broken chain down at her feet symbolizes freedom.  \n\nThis is a beautiful sculpture indeed in all terms. Though the symbolic meaning is not known to all, people all around the world come to visit the statue and the island only to enjoy its exceptional beauty. Earlier, the visitors could have reached the torch but now the visit is limited. It has been enlisted with the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1984."

    "Answer": "Thank you for this interesting cue card topic. Today, I would like to talk about an enjoyable day, which I spent in the countryside of my beautiful country in the last summer. Not to mention, I will remember the experience for a long, long time to come.\n\nAnyway, it was during the last summer in the month of August, a couple of my friends told me that they were really tired of their monotonous work life and that they wanted to get out of the town for a little and visit some beautiful countryside which was only about a couple of hours drive from our busy city. Initially, we thought of riding a bus, but then we changed our mind and decided to rent a nice private car to transport us to that beautiful countryside which I had already visited a couple of times in the past.\n\nAnyway, when we arrived at the countryside, we all were stunned by the mesmerising view of the beautiful countryside there with its huge and beautiful lakes – two long but narrow lakes, running side by side. Between the lakes were beautiful looking paddy fields that were stretching as far as eyes could see. On the other sides of the lakes were the meadows which were being patiently “explored” by different kinds of birds without any fear. We all walked by the lakes, while also taking the pictures of the beautiful birds in it, and tried to catch some fishes. At some points, we even opened the door of the car and started our music player to listen to some of our favourite songs while enjoying some snacks. All in all, it was a blast.\n\nAnyway, it was indeed a very enjoyable day in the countryside because we could actually see some unadulterated natural scene at its best without any sort of distraction. It was very enjoyable also because all of us opened up to each other and laughed to our hearts’ content after a long time."

    "Answer": "A couple of months ago I, with my family, went to the Barossa Valley to have some relief from the city life. This was a great place indeed to get the desired relaxation. Wandering around the vineyards was the most excellent task that I ever undertook. All the other members were happy as well. This is a nice cue card topic for me and I will answer the remaining questions below.\n\nI went there with my family, as I said before. I was accompanied by my wife Samantha and my daughter, Merry. I am an executive working with the marketing division of a multinational company while my wife is a school teacher. And Merry is in her fifth grade in the school. So, every one of us remains busy round the day and week and have less time for relaxation. Besides, getting day offs is also a troublesome issue for me. So, I intentionally persuaded them to manage leave from their respective tasks.\n\nWe had great fun there. The natural view of the valley was eye-catching and the place was filled with many other tourists like us. In fact, everyone needed some relief from their ordinary life. And this is the nearest place in Adelaide, Australia, to get some fresh air. Besides, we also enjoyed the walk in the valley, through the vineyards and some other attractive places. The stores set up in the area provided us with some of the classic stuff.\n\nHonestly, I enjoyed it there so much. My daughter was highly delighted to get such a place to visit and she was really amazed. We also visited the Barossa Historical Museum and Greenock Aviation Museum and the exhibitions were charming, especially the miniatures of aircraft. The tour was adorable indeed and I am planning to have some solo tour at the place."

    "Answer": "To be honest, I have lived only in a few places in my entire life until I started attending university. In fact, it was after starting my university life that I got an opportunity to live at a place for a short period of time, and today I would like to talk about that place.\n\nThe place, I am talking about, was a small industrial town. It was a small town alright, but it was certainly very crowded with many different kinds of industries, and I went to live there because I was offered a paid internship position in this town by one food processing firm to work as a Management Trainee.\n\nThe internship position was only for a period of 3 months, but after arriving at that place, I felt that I wouldn’t last there for more than 3 weeks, primarily because it was like a town of only “robotic people” who didn’t know anything else except just working and making money. In fact, after living there for only a week, I started to feel homesick. Besides, I could also feel how I was inhaling polluted air there on a daily basis. Luckily, my supervisor understood my situation and told me where to visit if I was too bored or homesick.\n\nSo, anyway, as my supervisor had suggested me, I started to visit a restaurant at the outskirt of the town almost every other day after my work in order to enjoy some live music while playing some billiards. By the way, it was a rather expensive restaurant, but it was also the only place in that “robotic” town where I could feel little “alive”.\n\nAnyway, after having lived there alone for 3 months, when I was leaving that industrial town, I felt like I was getting out of some kind of prison. Of course, I was glad of the fact that I learned a lot of things about the realities of life by living in that town for only a short period of time, but I also felt at the same time that these lessons didn’t have to come at the expense of freedom, friendship and environment."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for the opportunity to let me talk about a place where I lived only for a while. During my study in Germany, I had to stay in Munich for about five months. In fact, I was unable to stay the entire course period of my post-graduation. I was troubled with some familial issues and considering the facts, the university authority allowed me to attend online classes and lectures. This is a great cue card topic for me and I will describe the matter in brief now.\n\nI got the chance as a scholarship-granted student at the Munich Academy but could not attend the first and second quarter. So, I went to Munich from Malaysia and stayed with a native family to pass the remaining days. It was not possible for me to arrange for a seat in the university dormitory. So, I had to accommodate myself at the residence of a German whom I met online. He had a very nice family and every one of them cooperated me to complete the course.\n\nI lived there for less than six months. And the entire time I was with the German family. It was a different experience for me to stay out of the home and with some completely unknown people. But it enriched my level of experience and I did get some unexpected support from them. I tried to help the family members as well and often cleaned the garden before their residence. I also used to help the kids of the family in learning some practical issues too.   \n\nI really felt pathetic when I left home and returned to Malaysia. In fact, I turned a member of their family. They loved and cared for me much. Even they did not take any money from me in exchange for my living there though I wished to pay them. So, it became the greatest kindness to me. However, I really miss the family."

    "Answer": "I am usually prompt and proactive when it comes to keeping appointments whether these appointments are with family/friends or complete strangers. But, then I am also a human, and I do forget to keep my appointments once in a while. Today, I would like to talk about one such appointment which I had with one of my friends but then completely forgot.\n\nIt was about six months ago when my good friend had asked me to take him to the airport in my car and pick up his uncle at around 6:00 pm. Seeing that both my friend and the airport were within a short distance from my office, I didn’t have a reason for not helping out my friend on that Monday evening. So, as soon as my good friend asked that little favour from me, I immediately agreed.\n\nBut, before promising my friend to help him pick up his uncle, I totally forgot that Monday was always the busiest day at my office since it is the first day in the office after the weekend. So, I kept working and working on that day until I suddenly noticed on my watch that it was already 5:30 pm, and I couldn’t even finish 70 per cent of my scheduled tasks for the day. Of course, I still had 30 minutes left to keep my appointment, but then I thought that it wouldn’t be such a wise idea since there always was a risk of getting stuck in bad traffic and miss the appointment. So, I immediately called my friend and explained to him the situation while also providing him with a phone number to call a taxi driver who lived closed to my friend.\n\nAnyway, it was equally a frustrating and awkward situation for both of us. I could even feel some anger, and very rightly so, in my friend, but when I explained to him about a very busy Monday office day, and how I completely forgot about it before making that appointment with him, he finally got convinced that I wasn’t being careless at all and that I genuinely wanted to help him."

    "Answer": "I made a mistake by forgetting an appointment with a friend of mine, Chin Chun, due to my family engagement. It was an embarrassing matter for me. Every year, the Chinese people celebrate the Hungry Ghost Festival and it has been going on for thousands of years. In fact, this has become one of the most important festivals across the country to drive away or satisfy the ghost and spirits of the ancestors. I was supposed to meet this friend to take part in the festival together. This is a great cue card topic and I would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about it.\n\nI was supposed to meet with Chin Chun at her home in the evening of the last day of July and it was planned earlier that we two would go for a shopping to get some necessary stuff to celebrate the festival that was held in last month, August. But unfortunately, I was highly busy with maintaining my own family arrangement for the festival. And thus I unintentionally forgot about the appointment.\n\nI was too busy to pick up her phone call. So, when I managed everything, I called her back and was ready to listen to some advice. She was angry with me and told that she would not go shopping with me. I knew she was lying to me. And I told her that I had to do everything on my own this year as my mom was sick.\n\nIt was difficult for me to convince her. Actually, Chin Chun is introvert and I am the only friend she trusts. So, I proposed her to buy a present for her marking the occasion. At first, she did not accept my idea but as I insisted, she agreed with me. I had bought some attractive incenses for her to be used in the ghost festival. She was happy indeed."

    "Answer": "By default, human nature is programmed to be socially active by any means to a certain extent, and for this, they don’t only use the traditional methods, but also different kinds of social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Today, I would like to talk about one of these social media platforms which I also happen to use from time to time.\n\nThis social media network, I like to use, is Facebook. Of course, I don’t really think that I need to reintroduce the mighty Facebook to anybody, but just in case if somebody doesn’t know, it is the most popular social media networking site that started its journey in the year of 2004 in California, USA. Since then, Facebook didn’t really have the time to look back as the number of its users started to grow exponentially. Today, with more than 2.25 billion monthly users worldwide (which is like almost the one-third of our world’s total population!), 65 million business pages and six million advertisers, Facebook certainly has set a new benchmark in all kinds of social networking ideas.\n\nBut, anyway, I am no businessman nor am I an advertiser. So, I use this “addictive” social media site, purely for the purpose of remaining connected with my family, friends and relatives who live far away from me.\n\nThere are a number of benefits of using Facebook. For example, it is really easy to get started on this networking site, and it supports all kinds of content formats, such as text, images, videos, live videos and stories. Besides, it also allows people to connect and communicate with others, speaking different languages, from all over the world, thanks to its translation feature.\n\nAnyway, this website helps me in a great way by keeping me in touch with my loved ones at all times and at no extra cost. Besides, it also allows me to remain updated with trending news on health, food, fashion, sports and lifestyles, among many other things. Finally, it also helps me in sharing important ideas and information with others to rally their supports to bring positive changes in our life."

This is a great candidate task card topic and I am happy to have it in my share. I would like to thank you for the opportunity and time to let me talk about this.\n\nHonestly, I use Facebook for communicating with my friends and relatives who live far away from me. It also helps me to communicate with some other people and share my recent happening with them in terms of text status or by uploading photographs. In fact, this is the social networking service that has helped me in a number of ways and I can reach to anyone who has an account with the network.\n\nBefore using this social networking service, it was really difficult to communicate. And obviously, communication was an expensive matter too. But with the use of this networking website, I easily can share my thoughts, photos, and many other matters. Besides, the students of my university in Tianjin, China, are using this website as a platform for gathering opinions from the fellow students on various socio-economic issues. This is a user-friendly website and requires less knowledge to maintain an account.  \n\nI am benefitted with the website in numerous ways. Browsing the website, I come to know about the latest happenings in the world. Actually, this has become a great virtual space where people share their respective events to let others know.

    "Answer": "Choosing a common dress that females wear in Malaysia, my native country, certainly is a challenging thing since there are many ethnic groups, living in this great country, who have different cultures and different fashion ideas. Some ladies here like to wear long skirts/pants and head scarves while others like to wear “Kebaya”. Then some others like to wear “BajuKurung”, which is the subject topic of today’s discussion.\n\n\"BajuKurung\" arguably is one of the most traditional and common dresses in Malaysia for the females today although its history goes back to as early as the 15th century. Interestingly enough, even though, bajukurung is the name for the attire for both men and women, in Malaysia, traditionally it is the female dress which is referred to as Bajukurung, while the male dress is referred to as bajumelayu. Anyway, talking about “BajuKurung” for the females, it is a loose-fitting full-length costume, consisting of a skirt and a tunic. The skirt is made from a long cloth with pleats on one side; the blouse is collarless, has long sleeves, and extends to between the hips and knees. It is sometimes made of imported silk from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan or Turkey.\n\nOf course, the modern-day bajukurung commonly uses lively colours and geometric patterns, which certainly adds a new dimension to the fashion appeal of this particular dress. By the way, BajuKurung is widely recognised as one of the most common and traditional female dresses in Malaysia, it is also used in other parts of South East Asia, such as Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and Thailand.\n\nAnyway, in response to the question whether I really like this dress or not, I would rather jokingly say that it doesn’t really matter whether I like it or not as long as the ladies like it (**chuckling**)! But, on a serious note, yes, I do like this dress since women look really comfortable in them. Besides, in my rather “inexpert” opinion, this particular dress goes really well with the “lean” body structure of our Malaysian ladies."

    "Answer": "Australia is a beautiful land of variations and women in this country enjoy some of the best facilities in terms of attires. They love to wear various types of dresses marking occasions but in their ordinary life, they prefer to be comfy in dresses. So, the majority of the Australian women wear lightweight dresses like tops, shirts, blouses and use either trousers made with soft fabrics or jeans pant. This is a nice candidate task card and the remaining answers are here.\n\nUsually, the tops worn by the Australian women come with a full sleeve, half sleeve or sleeveless format. The tops are made with feather-light fabrics and comfortable to wear. When they are at home, usually they wear trousers in different styles and when they go out, they wear jeans or other formal pants with tops. But the colour combination is an important issue to consider. They try matching or adjusting the dress colour when they are out of the home.\n\nThe dress is not common in other countries. Due to the climatic settings, lifestyle and necessity, the women of Australia have become habituated with such dress. But the style is not followed in the other countries. Some of the countries have some sort of restrictions for dresses and particularly for the dresses worn by females.\n\nOf course, I like the dress so much. In fact, as an Australian national and female, I also like wearing blouses and pants. The fabrics are soft, easily washable and last longer than any other dresses. The most important matter here is the design. The tops are available in a large number of designs and they are sold at a reasonable price too. Both the tops and pants fit the women and they can also customize in case of necessity."

Accordingly, the abaya is worn by almost all the women here and even I myself love wearing the dress. The lightweight dress is comfortable to wear and also enhances the beauties of the women. This is a nice cue card topic for me and I would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about it. I will answer the remaining questions here.\n\nAn abaya is a long cloak and usually, it is found in black colour. This is worn over the other clothes to cover up the body. The women of my country may wear anything they want under the abaya but they have to use these clothing. Besides, the fabric and colour of abaya may vary and most of the times women take it by their own choices.    \n\nNo, this is not a common dress for females in other countries. In fact, Qatar is a bit conservative about the dress of its women. And there are some state laws to wear decent dresses for both the men and women. The clothes should cover the shoulder, knees, and could not be transparent. Besides, the dresses should also be comfortable and presentable to anywhere. As a result, abaya has become a usual dress for the women in my country while the women in different other countries do not follow such rules.\n\nOf course, I am in favour of this dress. This is a nice attire for the women and also helps to remain safe from the dust and other unwanted matters. When I cover the body with the abaya, I feel comfortable indeed. Moreover, this is a smart dress and comes with proper ventilation. So, I love it the most."

In fact, if I know that there is a quiz show on TV, I don’t really bother to watch other programmes, no matter how great and entertaining they really are. Today, I would like to talk about one such great TV quiz which I got hooked with, after watching it for the first time about a decade ago.\n\nThe name of this TV quiz show is called “Jeopardy”.  Arguably regarded as the best and most popular TV quiz show, as well as one of the 60 greatest shows of all time in American television history, Jeopardy started its journey in the year of 1964.\n\nSince then, more than 8000 episodes of this quiz show have been aired which helped it win a record number of 33 Daytime Emmy Awards as well as a Peabody Award. Jeopardy has also gained a worldwide following with regional adaptations in many other countries.\n\nThis quiz show, currently hosted by Alex Trebek, features a quiz competition, in which 3 contestants, including the returning champion, are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and are expected to must phrase their responses in the form of questions. Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people, and \"what is/are\" for things or words. Also, this quiz show is comprised of three rounds: Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, and Final Jeopardy, and the material for the clues (all these clues in the show are actually presented as \"answers\") covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages. The show is aired 5 times a week.\n\nAnyway, I enjoy this show much, primarily because it allows me to engage in a competition of intellect from the comfort of my own home and living room. I enjoy the show also because it helps me take my knowledge to the next level while providing the confidence in me to actually take part in this show someday with those other smart contestants."

A nurse from the Second World War period is taken back to 1743 and she encounters a good number of events. This is really an interesting television series I have seen so far. This is a great cue card topic for me and I will describe the events now.\n\nTwo seasons of the series has been aired so far.

Caitriona Balfe plays the role of Claire Beauchamp Randall/Fraser in the first series while it was also starred by Sam Heughan on the role of James with Tobias Menzies on the role of Frank Randall, Laura Donnelly as Jenny Fraser, Duncan Lacroix as Murtagh Fraser, Steven Cree as Ian Murray among others.\n\nThe first season had 16 episodes together, and the first eight episodes were aired in August in 2014 and September of the same year. And the remaining eight episodes of the series of the first season was aired in April of 2015 and ended by May of the same year. The second season of the series was aired in April of 2016 and ended by July of the same year.

Regrettably, however, there are only a few of them that I can think of. But, I will still go ahead and talk about one of those things today that made me feel proud of myself, at least to some extent, about 10 years ago from now.\n\nWhen I did this thing about 10 years ago, I had just started my college life rather reluctantly at a small college in my hometown. I am using the word “reluctantly” here because I was very interested to attend one of the largest and prestigious colleges of my country outside of my hometown, but my grandparents wouldn’t want me to leave my joint family and our small town.\n\nAnyway, back to the original story, the college, I was attending back then, had a very limited scope or opportunities to help students get involved with extra-curricular activities, especially, in sports. But, I loved to play table tennis, and our college didn’t have any facilities for playing table tennis there. So, the first thing that I did was to find some like-minded students like me who would be interested to play table tennis with me, and luckily I succeeded in doing that. Later, I proposed to them that we each would contribute some money to buy the table tennis balls, the net, and the table on our own, and they all agreed to it. Soon, we got everything we needed to play table tennis, except a room, but that too was arranged for us soon after as we applied to the college authority to provide a room for us for our table tennis practice.\n\nAnyway, I felt really proud when this happened, primarily because I succeeded in convincing not only some of my classmates but also the college authority to get on board with me with this initiative. Besides, I also felt that we can actually accomplish a lot of things in our life if remain positive about our plans and abilities."

But, today, I would like to talk about one particular place in another part of the world which I would really like to visit in future.\n\nThis particular place, I would like to visit, is called “Hawaii” which is located in the USA. To many people in this world who like to travel, Hawaii is very much like a paradise. Regarded as the most isolated population centre on the face of the earth, with more than 137 islands that stretches over 1500 miles, it is the only US state which is located outside the continent of North America and the only island state.\n\nBut, I didn’t know anything about this place until I saw some travel shows on television, as well as by reading many travel magazines. I also learned about this place from the writing of one of the most famous American authors of all time called “Mark Twain”, who said in one of his books that Hawaiian islands are “the loveliest fleet of the island that lies anchored in any ocean”. Needless to say, many who make the journey to the Aloha State will often agree, and this is where I would like to visit in future. But, unfortunately, from where I live, I can travel to this place only by taking a flight because this place is located more than 10,000 kilometres away from my country on another continent.\n\nAnyway, I would like to visit Hawaii, primarily because it arguably has the most beautiful and inviting warm water beaches that one can find anywhere not only in America but also in the whole wide world. In fact, every island in Hawaii is home to a famous beach. Besides, Hawaii also has some of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world that would constantly remind us of a magical scene with their lush rainforest vegetation.

In fact, I used to ride it for a significant part of my day, after school hours, with my friends just for the fun of it. But, little did I know back then that riding cycle was also very good for health.\n\nAnyway, now that I know how good cycling really is for my health, I want to start cycling after a couple of months again for the purpose of getting more healthy and fit. And for that, all I need to do is to buy a nice bike and find some times out of my busy schedule to ride it. By the way, cycling is a low impact physical exercise that provides our muscle with a good workout by using all of the major muscle groups as we pedal. People call it “low impact” because it causes less strain and injuries than most other forms of exercises.\n\nAnyway, cycling would be good for my health, primarily because it would help me burn whatever bad fat is left in my body while also increasing my stamina, strength and aerobic fitness. Besides, it would help me improve my physical and mental health greatly by allowing me to breathe some fresh air in the open while enjoying the outdoors also at the same time. So, it is time to become a child again and have some fun with cycling just like the old days!"

    "Answer": "I would like to start taking part in outdoor activities for the betterment of my health. And I have selected swimming for that. In fact, swimming has numerous health benefits and it also helps to keep the swimmers fit. This exercise helps people to remain healthy and fit round the day. It also improves our muscle strengths and raises the stamina level. I like this cue card topic very much and would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about it. And I will answer the remaining questions in brief.\n\nSwimming is an exercise that is not suitable for all types of people. Only who has the physical ability are able to swim. I will need the right place for swimming and have planned to become a member of The Dolphin Club here in San Francisco. I will need to follow the swimming schedule and get some proper costumes for swimming. Besides, I need to be careful while swimming as I am a fresher here.  \n\nI would like to attend the classes in the evening or on the weekends. Actually, this is not possible for me to attend the classes held in the early morning or in the afternoon as I remain busy with my professional engagements. I can manage time only in the evening or on the weekends when I do not have any tasks to do. The swimming classes are held for over one or two hours at a stretch, and this is unmanageable for me to attend those classes.  \n\nSwimming is a good form of exercise. This is the exercise that helps to make the arm-and leg-muscles stronger. It also needs the movement of the entire body at a time. So, it turns into a very good form of exercise for the swimmers. Therefore, I think this would be a good one for my health."

    "Answer": "Space, which is often shrouded by myths, mysteries and fiction, has always fascinated me since my childhood. Not to mention, of course, this fascination led me to some book buying spree and reading them like there is no tomorrow. “Chasing New Horizons” is one such book that I would like to talk about today.\n\nThis book, based on a true story, was published only a year ago or so, but I didn’t know about it until after a few months when one of my librarian friends told me about it. However, it is worth mentioning there even though, I didn’t get the chance to read this amazing book until recently, I was very much aware of the news when the “New Horizon Spacecraft” flew past “Pluto” planet in the year of 2015.\n\nAnyway, Chasing New Horizons tells the story of that space mission - like how it was designed, funded, built, launched, and operated – where its narrative is as recalled by Alan Stern, the mission’s principal investigator, and written up by the Astrobiologist and science communicator David Grinspoon. Together, these two prolific scientists and narrators have tried to deliver a meticulously detailed, riveting chronicle of America’s history-making mission to Pluto, escorting readers through the immense hurdles and hard work involved in the landmark mission. Of course, even though, it is a very powerful and epic description of a space journey that captured the hopes and dreams of a team of enterprising scientists and engineers and incorporated fascinating details from the spacecraft’s construction, the story has very little or no significance today, primarily because “Pluto” is no longer considered as a regular planet like the others.\n\nAnyway, after reading this book, I felt that it takes a lot more than just a good idea and talented scientists to fly a successful space mission. Besides, I also felt that there weren’t that many people in this world who could narrate such an intrepid planetary exploration in such easy terms and language without the use of technical “jargoning”.  Finally, I was really glad to have learned about so many other unknown things about a fascinating interstellar trip or journey."

    "Answer": "Two or three weeks ago, I missed the college for some bowel disorders and stayed home round the day. Usually, I do not have much time to spend on movies for my academic activities. So, I watched a movie named The Martian. It was a science fiction and I was amazed at the movie and its making. Overall, it was a nice experience for me. This is a splendid cue card topic and I like the questions. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about it.\n\nThe movie was made from a novel of the same name that was published in 2011. It was a story about an astronaut. While conducting an expedition on Mars, he got stranded. His team members thought that he was dead and failed to find him during a solar storm on the planet. So, they returned to the earth leaving him behind on Mars. But the astronaut did not die and had to struggle a lot to survive on that lonely planet. Later he, communicated with the base in earth and rescue operation was done to bring him back.\n\nThis is a significant story. Though it was a fiction in the movie, the days are not far when humans will conduct research and experiments on different planets. But they need to take precautionary measures so that there are no such events. Conducting a rescue operation on another planet takes much time and it is expensive as well. So, it was a kind of message to us to be careful about the things we are dealing with.  \n\nI felt thrilled with the movie. In fact, living alone on an entire planet is really tough and if there are less or limited supplies to live on, the situations become worse. It takes patience and perseverance to survive in such deserted situations and return to earth again."

    "Answer": "Not sure if it is a good thing or bad thing, but I am never really comfortable with talking about my successes (trust me, there aren’t very many) in front of others. Then, I dislike talking about my failures in front of others even more. So, thank you for this topic as I am going to talk about one of the few success stories of my life in brief here.\n\nIt happened about 10 years ago when I was transferred to a little town for my job. It was a nice town except that it just didn’t have enough public transportation facilities to transport the residents there from one place to another. So, most not-so financially well-off residents there would tussle with one another over the limited number of seats, or even over some empty space just to stand, in the buses and trains. Not to mention, of course, such struggle to travel from one place to another was really frustrating and annoying for the residents of that little town.\n\nSo, I, as a big city guy, decided to take up the issue to the local government authority as well as to some national daily newspaper. I even tried to collect a good number of signatures from the local residents of the town to file a formal petition, only to find out, of course, that they didn’t want to give their signatures since they didn’t have any confidence in the pathetic bureaucracy of our country. Some of them even tried to discourage me by saying that the government just didn’t have enough fund to buy additional public transportations for the small city people. But, I just didn’t want to give my fight, and after trying for almost a year, I was finally able to convince the authority to run more public transportations in that town.\n\nAnyway, I felt really glad after my success since it made the life of the poor residents of that little town much easier. Besides, I also felt that we should never underestimate our abilities to help other people, no matter how negative others around us can get."

    "Answer": "After my migration to Saudi Arabia, it was really difficult for me to cope with the changes. Everything was expensive and I could not bear the extreme living costs. So, I planned to start a business on a small scale and gradually I became a successful businessman here. I started a small food shop which sold only the traditional Asian foods and now the business has become a large one. The shop has become popular in the city of Dhahran. The city is also famous as the majority of the oil industry administration have settled in here. The smart cue card questions remind of the past days. And I will answer them in brief here.\n\nI migrated to Saudi Arabia in 2011 from Malaysia. In fact, my family inspired me to migrate to the land to establish my family business there but I turned into a failure to do so. Then, I decided to do something on my own. Accordingly, I made a plan and sought support from my family. They did not agree with me and asked me to seek options to establish the family business again. Finally, I denied their proposal and started my own business.\n\nInitially, I had experienced some difficulties. The most important issue was the lack of fund to run the business. I also needed expert hands to cook foods, particularly Asian food. Selecting a suitable location in the city was another remarkable matter. But, I have crossed all the barriers and established the business as a profitable one.\n\nI forgot all the past sufferings when I became successful. And the people who left me for my own business started returning to me. I enjoyed the matter but did not laugh at them. Besides, I have expanded the business in another city as well. I am happy now."

    "Answer": "Recently, about a month ago, I was on a vacation. Of course, if it was another time, I would have probably used this vacation to travel to some beautiful tourist spots. But, since the vacation was offered at a time when my whole country was crazy about the BPL (Bangladesh Premier League for Cricket), I also decided to spend the vacation in enjoying some cricket.\n\nBy the way, for those who don’t know about BPL, it is a professional cricket league, consisting of seven franchises from seven different regions of my country. Naturally, like many million cricket sports fans of my country, I was also a supporter of one of the franchises. So, I just didn’t want to miss any of their matches.\n\nAnyway, the sporting event was taking place in one of the major port cities of my country, which was even better, because it was a beautiful place with stunning natural beauty. So, I took a few of my friends with me and headed to that port city to watch a semi-final match that involved my favourite team. By the way, my friends were not supporting my team because they lost to it. So, I was the “lone warrior” there to support my team. But, when the match started, things looked rather bleak for my team as they were merely limping with their run rate. In fact, I lost my hope for a win. But, when the other team started to bat, I suddenly became charged up as they were playing even worse because of the fierce attack from our bowlers. Against my natural instinct, I even shouted to encourage my team. Finally, I left the stadium with a big smile because my team won.\n\nAnyway, I really had fun in that match because I could shout all I wanted while teasing my friends because of their defeat. Besides, I also took some pictures of me with some of my most favourite cricket stars from the world. Finally, the expensive snack, which I was enjoying during the match, tasted so delicious that would probably never forget about it."

    "Answer": "Recently, I went to watch an IPL cricket match in the local stadium here in Mumbai, India. I enjoyed the match very much. It was a high voltage match and some of the members of the national and international cricket team took part in it. Unluckily, the team that I supported was defeated by two wickets. This is a nice cue card topic indeed. I am happy to have it in my share. I would like to thank you for this nice topic.\n\nThe match was held at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. It was set to be held in the evening but the match was delayed for half an hour for rain. The organizers did not want the match to be damaged for the drizzling and thus they started the match about 30 minutes later of the scheduled time. But the stadium was filled with audiences before the time and there was a crowd everywhere. But everything went usually when the match began.\n\nThe game is memorable to me for some reasons. The topmost reason is that it was my very first experience of watching a cricket match inside a stadium. I was excited so much about the matter. And went there with some of my cousins. It was really a wonderful place to enjoy such a large sporting event. However, it was difficult for me to enjoy the entire match as I could not see the replays and the slow-motion ball deliveries or the LBW replays on the screen as I am habituated to watch them on the television screen.\n\nOverall, it was a nice experience for me. Visiting the stadium, the crowd of people, shouts from the supporters and the other matters were attractive. I was too happy to see some of the international players from a close distance."

    "Answer": "We have a number of important historical events in our country, Bangladesh, and all of those events have played an important role in making our country great. But, the “Victory Day” undoubtedly is the most important event of all in the historical context of my country as it gave us the “freedom” which we sought for more than a thousand years.\n\nThis victory day is celebrated all over my country on 16th of December every year because that’s the day when my country defeated the occupying/enemy forces in order to gain its full independence from “Pakistan”. By the way, before 1971, Bangladesh, used to be called \"East Pakistan\" while the other part of it was called “West Pakistan”. But, unfortunately, there was a lot of discrimination against East Pakistan as far as its economic development was concerned. Even politically, the people of East Pakistan enjoyed very limited power when it came to taking any important decision in order to bring some positive changes or developments in our part of the country.\n\nIn fact, East Pakistan had become a safe ground for economic exploitation for the west Pakistani ruling elites. Things got even worse when the military ruling junta of Pakistan refused to hand over the power to a democratically elected government, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1971. Eventually, people in East Pakistan started a non-violent movement to seek independence from Pakistan and then a war broke out between two parts of Pakistan. By the way, apart from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, some other key political figures like Taj Uddin Ahmed, Syed Nazrul Islam, and Major Ziaur Rahman (one of the 11 war sector commanders) actively took part in achieving the war victory on 16th of December of 1971.\n\nAnyway, it was an important historical event for my country, as it gave us a new identity as a new nation in the world map so that we could manage our own affairs as a nation. Besides, it also gave us an opportunity to achieve a more symmetrical economic development in our country which was not present under the rule of Pakistani military junta."

    "Answer": "The Umbrella Revolution is one of the most important historical events in Hong Kong. It was initiated by the students in 2014 and lasted for over three months, blocked traffic and usual activities for a couple of months. The movement was initiated to protest against the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. It was a political movement where the police turned violent and the situation went out of control for a certain time. This is a very smart cue card task for a candidate like me. I will answer the remaining questions in brief.\n\nThe umbrella movement protested against some political decisions. In the beginning, it was only some peaceful sit-ins by students of different educational institutions. But later, the movement was participated by thousands of individuals from different classes of society. The demand of the movement was the cancellation of the NPCSS decision. Political harassment was a concerning issue then.\n\nIt was a group movement and so, no true leadership was formed here. The movement was participated mostly by a group of students, and after sometimes, the locals started joining the movement. In fact, it was a movement for a free and fair election in Hong Kong so that each of the candidates gets an equal chance to be elected or rejected in the national election. The name was provided by Adam Cotton and social website - twitter helped greatly to spread the name.\n\nIt was really important for the country on some grounds. It showed that the people are conscious about their rights and responsibilities on voting in elections. The government termed the movements as instigated by foreign sources and also blamed that the educational institutions were becoming political tools. But it was necessary to give the government a severe blow to political issues."

    "Answer": "If I remember correctly, my life as a child was full of “troubles”, \"fun\" and \"happiness\".  In fact, my neighbours would find it more suitable to call me a “trouble maker” because I just wasn’t able to find any fun and adventure in my restless life without creating troubles!\n\nAnyway, my day started with an argument with my mother as to why my favourite breakfast was not made and ended with some other arguments like my bed was not comfortable enough to sleep and that I would feel better sleeping on the roof of our old two-storey building. In fact, calling my bed “uncomfortable” was just an excuse for me because I just loved to sleep on the room of our home, especially, during the summertime in order to enjoy the view of a clear sky and stars.\n\nBy the way, I never really enjoyed going to the school except on those days when it served delicious Tiffin like cakes, boiled eggs and fresh fruits instead of just some stale bread and jelly. Of course, back home, the story was different because my mother used to cook different kinds of food items every day including chicken biriyani, delicious hotch-potch, egg noodles, as well as fried fish and beef/mutton curry along with rice, among other things. By the way, I always used to have several other children around me. I think that they used to hang out with me only because they could cause a lot of mischief under my “guidance and shelter”.\n\nAnd as far as the question of who used to take care of me, it was only my father and strong-willed elder sister because my dear mother was too busy and too soft-hearted and gentle of a person to control an unruly child like me.\n\nAnyway, as a child, I enjoyed doing a lot of things, but the best among them was to run in an open field with my bicycle and displaying my cycle riding skills with different stances. I also enjoyed chasing beautiful little birds at a nearby garden because I wanted to catch them and play with them."

I would love to answer the remaining questions.\n\nI took the usual foods in my childhood. I loved the breakfast and lunch but was reluctant to have my dinner. In the breakfast, used to take a juice or milk and some cookies. Sometimes, I used to eat cakes as well instead of cookies. But the routine was different in the holidays. Taking pasta during lunch was my habit. Sometimes, it was altered by roasted potatoes and meat. I never liked fish. But mom used to force me into having the fishes for supper. Sometimes, I took pizza instead of fishes.\n\nIt was a small family. There were no external members to look after me. But my elder siblings were kind to me and they helped me greatly. In fact, my elder sister was the representative of my mom in her absence. She used to take care of me. She prepared me for the school, often fed me in supper and did many other activities that I will remember always.  \n\nOuting with my family members on the weekends in the attractive spots of Milan was the most enjoyable thing for me.

    "Answer": "I don’t normally like to visit any friend or family members at their workplaces because I think that such practice distracts them from their works.  Besides, I don’t exactly think that the bosses at workplaces would like that.  In fact, my boss thinks that it should be a standard norm not to visit anybody at his or her workplaces unless there is a very – I mean, very – valid reason to do so.  But, I broke that norm once and decided to meet one of my good friends at his workplace.\n\nActually, I haven’t met Patrick Lee, since the time we graduated from the university about 5 years ago, because right after finishing our university life, we had to go on our separate ways due to the professional reasons.  In fact, we both moved to two different cities with more than 250 kilometres of distance between us.\n\nOf course, I knew exactly where he used to work, and we even used to have phone conversations with each other once in a while in order to keep in touch with each other.  So, when an opportunity arrived one day in the form of an official tour into the city where Patrick lived, I just didn’t want to let the opportunity to meet my good old friend get wasted.  Of course, Patrick asked me to visit him the next day at his home, but I told him that I would remain too busy to meet him then.  So, in the end, it was decided that I would meet him at his workplace for a few minutes just for old time’s sake.\n\nBut, even though, it was supposed to be only a brief meeting for a few minutes, it went on for about a good 30 minutes, as we both tried to catch up with each other on what we had missed over the years while enjoying some great coffee.  In fact, I felt like we went back to our old university days again as we laughed and made jokes with each other as long as I was there at my friend's office."

The working environment was nice and adorable. Dad was surprised seeing me there too. I went there from my college and get back to college again after meeting with him. This cue card task topic is an excellent one and I would love to talk about it. Here are the remaining answers.\n\nDad worked for a multinational corporation in Nepal while the headquarters of the office was in Malaysia. The company had its wings in some other Asian countries too. It mostly dealt with export and import of varieties of goods including cosmetics and toiletries products. The office was located at a corner of Dharan covering a large space. It accommodated about 30 employees altogether and I found everyone busy with their respective tasks while my dad was in charge of the office.\n\nMy academic progress report card needed a signature of dad. Actually, I was not brave enough to get the signature again until it was the last date. I thought to submit it without the guardian’s signature and did so. But finding the card without a signature, my class teacher asked me to have it signed by my dad. So, in the last date of submission, I went to meet him at his office and got the report card signed.\n\nVisiting dad’s office was a memorable experience and I enjoyed spending time there. I loved the way of office arrangement. Everyone was performing their responsibilities in different positions. In a word everything in the office was standard. I liked the office space and inner allocation of staffs. But I was afraid about my dad’s reactions to my result. Luckily he was reserved on the day for his official activities which saved me from his undesirable anger."

    "Answer": "I don’t normally like to discuss my private matters with anybody unless, of course, I have a very valid reason to do so. But, the other day, I was casually doing exactly that with one of my senior cousins, who made the discussion rather interesting.\n\nOf course, I didn’t exactly want to get drawn into this sort of discussion, but when my cousin asked me about my future plan or how I was spending and managing my money, I thought that there was no harm in discussing the subject. In fact, I decided to have that discussion, mainly because I wasn’t really doing that well financially even though I was earning a reasonably good amount of money from my job. And, I told that to my cousin, he told me that earning enough money wasn’t just enough to have a secured financial future unless we were using the money in creating tangible assets.\n\nIn fact, he gave me an account of how he successfully turned around his failing business about a few years ago by wisely investing his little savings. So, again, according to him, earning enough money wasn’t just enough as one would also need to find a way to invest it properly with a long term plan by factoring out the future inflation. Anyway, the discussion was not only getting more and more interesting but also getting more and complicated. Finally, the discussion ended with a piece of advice from my cousin that we should have never spent more money than we would earn.\n\nAnyway, the discussion was really fascinating for me because it taught me a few effective tricks not only to save money but also to invest them wisely at the right time. Besides, the conversation also taught me how to create and maintain a link with financially successful people who could always teach us a thing or two on how to become a successful entrepreneur even when one doesn’t have any money at all. Finally, the discussion was also interesting because it taught me how to diversify my skills and money earning abilities."

I had a fruitful discussion with Mr Robert, a senior professor at my college in Florida. He teaches economics at the graduate level and a man of letters. He believed that people should have money in the head, not in the heart. Money is only a tool. But it will not make the things done until someone uses it correctly. Overall, it was a pleasant discussion with him. This is a smart cue card task for me. I will answer the other questions gladly.       \n\nMr Robert was taking a class about spending and saving money. In fact, he owned some ideologies. He never spent money before having that. So, he was talking to the class about money management. After the class, I went to meet him and he explained everything to me. I wanted to justify the way I was spending money for myself. Mr Robert explained the issues one after another and I was simply impressed with the examples.  \n\nAfter lots of arguments, I admitted that I made mistakes in money management. He advised me to never to lose money. Actually, I used to spend unnecessarily. And I told him the matters to get some good suggestions. In the end, I got a different insight. I decided to cut my coat according to my clothes. And also pledged to be careful in future about money management.\n\nThe discussion attracted me for its nature. I was unfamiliar with the ways of savings. And after the detail estimation, it was evident that I was in the wrong direction. Accordingly, I started following his advice and find everything right with me. Interestingly, I did the opposite things that Mr Robert suggested me this time."

Some of them even take pride in their works since they do them (their works) really well, and I am going to share the story of one such person, whom I have known for a long time.\n\nThis person is none other than the father of one of my high school friends who I have known for more than 10 years.  The person, I am talking about, is a “Tailor” or a “Dressmaker” by profession.  He runs his tailor shop at a very prime location of our hometown, and as far as I remember, I have never seen a dull moment at his shop because people from all over the town visit his shop to get their dresses made just the way they prefer.\n\nInitially, I thought that most people visit his shop to make their dresses because he would charge them less money for making them, but I was later proved out to be wrong when I found out that they visit him also because he is really good at his works.  Of course, one of the great characteristics of this person is that he personally gets involved with every detail of the works of his employees and subordinates so that there is no room for errors.  Besides, I have seldom seen him missing his work except when he is really sick. In fact, I have found him to be working even on public holidays sometimes.\n\nAnyway, I think that this person is really good at doing what he does, mainly because I have never heard any complaints from any of his customers about his quality of works.  Besides, the fact that so many people from in and outside of our city visit him on a daily basis to get all kinds of dresses done, be them for male, female, children or professional, goes to prove the fact that he is really good at his tailoring job."

She expresses her thoughts in painting beautifully and selects out of the box themes. Each of her paintings carries a message for her audience.\n\nAfter years of practice, she mastered painting. Before starting to teach painting at the school, she arranged exhibitions with her painting. Luckily I had the chance to visit one of such exhibitions. Undoubtedly those were some masterpieces. Her vision in mind makes her outstanding than other painters. She imitates what she thinks and so the paintings are stunning. She also takes less time to paint for her strong imagination skill.

And, I am certainly glad to have an opportunity today to tell something about this music band because it tops the list of all of my favourite music bands in the world.\n\nAnyway, if I remember correctly, I listened to the songs of this world-famous music band for the first time before almost 15 years when one of my rich high school friends played it for me in his car on our way to a market.  Back then, I didn’t own any audio cassette player at my home, but after listening to the songs of Enigma, I not only fell in love with their songs but also became very desperate to buy my own cassette player in spite of the reluctance of my parents.\n\nApparently, my parents thought that having a cassette player at home would distract me from my regular study works. But, I wasn’t exactly ready to listen to any advice or warnings from my parents because I wanted to listen to the songs of my most favourite music band to my heart’s content. Anyway, after buying my cassette player, only god knows how many times I had listened to their songs, which included the songs like “I love you, I’ll kill you”, “Age of loneliness” and “ Mea Culpa”.\n \nAnyway, I like this music band particularly because their songs are uniquely sensual with a very calming effect on minds and bodies. I like this music band also because their songs tend to transcend the time and generation, because of their extraordinary musical appeal, unlike the discos of 80’s, as well as the techno and hip-hop music of 90’s.  In fact, their music just takes me on a wonderful emotional journey every time, I listen to them."

    "Answer": "The Beatles is an English music band which was formed in England, and later on, the band gained unbelievable popularity across the world. It was one of the hit music bands in the world after its inception in the 1960s in Liverpool. 'The Beatles' was formed by George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. The band experimented with several types of music composition and became quite successful. It was widely popular for its unconventional types of music. This is a nice candidate task card for me and I am glad about this. Here are the remaining answers.  \n\nI have been listening to their songs since my childhood. Though the band is no longer available, I have a large collection of their songs. And often I love listening to their songs at my leisure hours. At present, I cannot manage much time owing my business to listen to music but when I was a student, I used to listen to music around the day. And the melodious songs of The Beatles entertained me much.  \n\nThe Beatles have lots of famous songs. The band has reshaped different types of songs and initiated pop culture. Some of the most noted songs of this band are – ‘Tomorrow Never Knows’, ‘The Ballad of John and Yoko’, ‘I Feel Fine’, ‘Getting Better’, ‘All My Loving’, ‘Hello Goodbye’, ‘All You Need is Love’ etc. All the songs were composed and tuned in a different manner. So, they gained global popularity.  \n\nThere are many reasons to like this group. The band has dominated the rock era of the world. And I am in love with the music style of The Beatles. The group has experimented with various types of music genre together and the application of classical instruments have brought the change in style. The band was commercially successful as well and each individual of this band is a legend, and this is quite rare for any music band in history. So, I like this band very very much. Their music still inspires me and help me fight my stress."

    "Answer": "In my childhood, when I had just started high school, my parents always used to encourage me to become a doctor and serve people, especially, the poor and needy people.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t fulfil the wish of my parents for some reasons.  But since then, I have always held a very high level of admiration for all kinds of doctors, one of whom eventually became my childhood hero in the subsequent years.\n\nHis name was Mr Golam Maola.  I met this gentleman for the first time in my early childhood when my father, along with me, took my terminally ill grandfather about 30 years ago.  But, before taking my ailing grandfather to him, we had already taken him to a number of other doctors, but all of them didn’t want to take any risk with his surgery, because, apparently, my grandfather was very seriously ill.\n\nBy the way, Mr Golam Maola, a very eminent doctor and surgeon back then used to live in my very own city, and so, we already had heard a lot about his success stories.  So, when the slim but old doctor, in his late 60’s, agreed to operate on my grandfather, we knew that there was a little ray of hope as far as the question of my grandfather’s survival was concerned.  And, the expert doctor, considered to be one of the best surgeons in South Asia back then, didn’t disappoint us as my grandfather had survived that time. Anyway, it was after that positive and pleasing experience, the eminent doctor and surgeon had become my childhood hero and remained so for a long time.\n\nMr Golam Maola is no more with us, nor he is my hero anymore, but it was because of his success and fame that I started to study harder in order to become a successful medical surgeon just like him.  Besides, it was because of his influence that I became a volunteer at a non-profit, charitable organization which used to raise funds to help the poor patients with no money or support in my hometown."

    "Answer": "I used to watch the television series George Shrinks and it had a great impression on me in my childhood. In fact, George, the little hero, of this series became my real-life model. He was a little boy but his life was filled with adventures. He moved from one place to another with the car that his father invented. Interestingly, the Zooper car could take different other shapes like a submarine of a helicopter. And the activities he took part in were really amazing. This is an interesting cue card task for me and it reminds me of my childhood. The remaining answers are here.\n\nGeorge was my hero for his adventurous nature. In my childhood, I was also a young girl who wanted to have an adventure. But unluckily, I did not have the chance to take part in. My parents did not allow me to get out of home activities fearing that I might get injured or harmed. But George was accompanied by his father and had many adventures in his life. So, he became my hero.\n\nNo, I do not consider George as a hero anymore. In fact, I have become matured and the ideas have changed. The things George took part in were suitable for children only. And as an adult, they do not attract me anymore. Actually, the appeal of that show is for the kids only and I am not interested. My taste has changed and I do not watch the animation movies or attracted to any children’s series.\n\nI used to play like George. I also regretted the Zooper car. Once I dreamt of having a car like that Zooper car which was made by George’s father. Moreover, his encounters with robotic aliens and other people also amazed me. I tried to follow him in my everyday life."

    "Answer": "Where I live in my country, dealing with some kind of noises is a daily thing, simply because I live in a rather densely populated country. Of course, some places can be noisier than others, and today, I would like about one of those more noisy places, I visited in the past.\n\nThe noisy place, I am talking about, is a “rail station”. But it was not just like any other rail station as it was the biggest one in my country.  In fact, the station could hold about 30 trains at any given time, and it was very easy for a person to make mistake with his or her train if he or she didn’t know the proper platform number for his/her train.\n\nBy the way, the station was also used to connect with the rest of the country. Anyway, I had visited the same rail station, full of noise, a number of times in the past, but when I visited it about a few years ago in order to pick up one of my friends from another town, the noise was even more deafening, probably because there were some major schedule debacles.  \n\nOf course, the rail station was already noisy enough with thousands of passengers, either arriving at the station or departing from it. On top of that, there were also the sounds of the moving trains, which were either arriving at the station or departing from it, to make the noise situation even worse. Then, there were also the sounds of the conversation of thousands of passengers along with the sounds of their luggage carrying trolleys.   \n\nAfter arriving at the station, I felt like I was about to lose my hearing and ears. At some point, I even felt like shouting to the people at the rail station and ask them to stop talking just for a minute, but I knew very well that it was not going to work because waving goodbye to their loved ones or meeting them with joy and happiness was more important to them than paying attention to me!"

    "Answer": "My recent Hong Kong trip made me familiar with some of the noisy places there. I went shopping at a local street market after knowing about the features but experienced with extreme noise that I failed to tolerate to some extent. And I never had this type of experience before. I went to Stanley Market in the city to get some necessary items I forgot to bring from my home in Australia. This is a great cue card task for me. I will love answering the remaining questions.\n\nI went to Hong Kong for some commercial purposes and it was about setting up a branch of my office there. The trip was interesting and I came to know about numerous matters that I did not know before. Someone from the hotel told me to visit the street markets to get the necessary things. Accordingly, I paid the visit and experienced the noise. But luckily I got my stuff at a cheaper price.  \n\nThe place was noisy for several reasons. First of all, it was a street market and thus it was crowded. People from around the city gathered there to get their things. A lot of street shops were there laden with various types of goods. All of the people present at the market were talking and the sounds were intolerable to some extent. The people who have not been at the market will not understand the noise. At a point, it appeared that the entire place was filled with life.\n\nInitially, I was uncomfortable amid the noise. The sellers and buyers were trying to convince each other and some of the sellers were shouting across the market after the search of potential customers. But after passing about one hour in the market, I tried to adjust to the situation."

    "Answer": "As a young schoolboy, I used to like a lot of things about my elementary school, such as playing with friends in the school playground and sharing tiffin with them. However, there was another thing, that I really liked about my elementary school, was the periodic art and craft activities. Today, I would like to describe one such activity that I did as a young elementary school student.\n\nThis particular art and craft activity involved “making picture album” with cardboard. Of course, in the beginning, I wasn’t really very interested in doing any art or craft activity because I wasn’t simply enjoying it as much as other school activities. Not exactly sure, why I was not enjoying it as much, but it was probably because I was doing it alone. But, as our school got a new art teacher, later on, he understood the problem and decided to group the students like us together in order to make us collaborate with each other. Anyway, it is time to go back again to describe my “picture album” that I made in elementary school.\n\nIn order to make this album, I used some hard cardboard, some photo magnet papers, a hole puncher, and a couple of heavy binding cords. First, I cut strong cardboard into two sheets in the same size and dimension. After that, I cut as many sheets of photo magnet papers as I want to the same dimensions as the cardboard covers. Then, I just attached or stick those photo magnet papers with the cardboard in order to stack them in a layer on top of another. Finally, I punched two holes along one side of the stacked layers in order to tie them together with the cord binders by threading through the punched holes.\n\nAnyway, I felt really great about this particular art and craft activity as I could actually see the result of my hard works with my own eyes. Besides, this particular activity also allowed me to share some good laughs and quality time with some of my other fellow students which otherwise wouldn’t be possible."

    "Answer": "Thank you a lot for this opportunity to let me talk about an art or craft activity I did at school. School days were fun and I miss those days very much. I enjoyed all the art and craft classes and activit9ies involved in it. Once I made a book about me and it was an interesting experience to make a book all by myself and about me. The book contained various interesting information about me and my family. I also wrote about my friends in the book and added some pictures of them. In the later stages, the book became the best wealth for me. The cue card questions are standard and I love answering such smart questions. The answers continue below.\n\nPreparing a book for me was difficult. As a child of seven or eight years old, I was unable to collect all the things. I needed paper, book design, crayons, markers, photos and obviously some information about me and my surrounding people placed on the book. My siblings helped me greatly to collect all the materials and make the work complete. I had to collect information and images from my friends and parents to fill spaces in the book.   \n\nThe project was individual, but I took helps from my friends and particularly from my elder brother. My brother arranged the necessary materials. I asked to bring some coloured papers and he brought accordingly. Moreover, I asked a friend to collect information about a few other friends. One more thing to share. It was a time-bound project. The teacher allowed us only a day to complete the project and submit to her. I was glad to gather everything on time.\n\nI enjoyed making the book and it was fun. I had never made such books or worked in such an art and craft project. Thanks to the teacher for her endeavour to arrange such an event. In fact, the entire process made me confident. I felt joy and pride inside me. My book was chosen as the best among the items submitted by many other students."

    "Answer": "I haven’t really won that many things in my life, perhaps because I haven’t really been that competitive in life. However, there were a few occasions when I managed to win a thing or two by defying all the odds, and today I would like to share one such story. \n\nThe prize, I won, was a “book” when I was a high school student about 12 years ago. I wasn’t exactly a very bright student during my high school days, but, I still somehow managed to get an admission at one of the best government high schools in my country. It was all good at my high school, but it certainly had a different culture as everything was very competitive there. Even meeting new friends or mingling with other fellow students was not an easy thing to do, especially, for an average student like me.\n\nSo, I was essentially a “backbencher” or some kind of “outcast” there. Feeling a bit dejected, I wanted to prove something – my worth- to them.  So, I started to wait for an opportunity, and it came on my way after almost waiting for 6 months in the form of an “essay” writing competition. It was an open competition, so all of my fellow brilliant classmates were able to take part in it.\n\nAnyway, we had only two days to submit the essay, so I forgot about eating or taking a shower in order to collect enough information on the essay writing skills and techniques.  Finally, after a marathon 2-day effort, I did submit my essay and wished to achieve some “big” success, and I wasn’t disappointed as I got the 2nd best prize in that essay writing competition.\n\nAnyway, after winning the competition, I felt like I was flying to the moon with so much joy and happiness. In fact, it was for the first time, I felt that I could actually be as good as any other person if I really had tried hard. Besides, after winning my first-ever prize, I felt like I earned some “bragging rights” to boast about my success among my friends."

    "Answer": "My participation in a chess competition brought me one of the best prizes in my life and I am going to tell you about this event and the award I won. The competition was held in my college in Berlin, Germany around three years ago. The chess competition was arranged marking the annual sports events. Though several other contests were included in this event, I picked chess for my love and passion for the game. I would like to thank you for letting me talk about it.\n\nThe battle of the mind is one of the most exclusive types of war, I believe and this is more prevalent in a gaming competition. I had to compete and outwit my competitors in several stages to win the competition. The first stage of competition began in the morning and ended by noon. The final completion held after lunch and ended in the evening. I got a break when I tried to reshape my ideas and start again with vigour and determination to become the champion the next day. But fighting the competitors with outstanding talents and skills was extremely difficult. In fact, they were highly intelligent and expert in playing chess.  \n\nAmong the other competition, chess was comparatively less preferred by the competitors. There were several reasons for ignoring chess. I think the sluggish nature of the game discouraged to take up on the competition. So, we were eight players altogether in the entire competition. Each of the players was skilled and knew how to manipulate the game. The capacity to influence the thought of rivals was truly amazing.  \n\nA blanket of joy surrounded me after winning the prize in chess competition. I defeated the former champion and became the new champion of inter-department chess championship of our college. I was proud of my victory. I underwent huge stress around two days to participate in the competition. My parents were happy to learn that I became the new champion. The victory and winning the prize was a remarkable event in my life.\n\nTo illustrate the prize, it was insignificant compared to the achievement. The real reward is in the glory of the title, not the money or the trophy. However, I still have the trophy and I used the prize money, which was 500 euros, to buy some books and gifts for my parents and my young sister."

    "Answer": "Some people adore it as the “queen of the flowers” while others like to call it “the flower of beauty and love”. Poets around the world have also written many, many poems about this particular flower because of its exceptional beauty. But, as for me, I just like to call it my favourite flower.\n\nThe flower, I am talking about, is of course “Rose”. Recognized as the flower of love, sympathy or sorrow, the cultivation of roses first began in China some 5000 years ago. After that, the flower only kept conquering the minds and hearts of millions around the world with its 150 different species or more, because of their stunning beauty and fragrance.\n\nBy the way, when talking about its beauty, the petal structure of this flower is so intricate that it's almost impossible to do roses any real justice in art.  This beautiful flower can come in all colours although a \"black rose\" is not actually black, rather it looks very much like “dark red”. Each colour has a different symbolic meaning to us.  For example, red means love, orange symbolizes desire while yellow means “joy” and so on. \n\nRoses typically grow in warm climates, and flower in the summer months, but some roses can grow in the hot tropical climate as well, while others can grow in winter temperatures that drop as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit.  So, roses essentially can grow in a number of different climates. However, as for my country, it grows pretty much anywhere, including home and out in the field. Many people in my country grow this plant on a commercial basis also as there is a huge demand for it. In fact, I would say, the flower is very common in my country.\n\nAnyway, it is my favourite flower because they look just so gorgeous and it has some exceptional fragrance. Besides, they also add a very beautiful look to the room in which they are kept. Finally, they are my favourite flower also because they are easy to get when I need them for any special occasion."

    "Answer": "Sunflower, an amazingly beautiful flower that could be found in most parts of the world, is my favourite flower. The French word for sunflower literally means \"turn with the sun\" and sunflowers do just that, at least the young plants do. In my childhood when I noticed this attribution of this flower, I became fascinated about it. I would like to thank you for giving me the chance to talk about my favourite flower.\n\nThe botanical name of the common sunflower is \"Helianthus Annus\", which I did not know until I started my high school and had to memorise that for an exam. I also learned that sunflowers were first domesticated by Native Americans, who grew and harvested them thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans to North America.\n\nNowadays, this flower could be found in most parts of the world. Ukraine, Russia and Argentina are the top three sunflower seed producing countries in the world. This flower is widely available in my country and it is hard to find someone who is not enchanted with the beauty of this flower. So I would say, it is a pretty common flower in my country and many gardeners love to have it in their garden.\n\nThe practical use of this flower is also huge. Some seeds are produced for human consumption while the relatively smaller seeds are used in commercial bird and animal foods. In my country, sunflower seeds are also a popular source for cooking oil.\n\nWhy do I like this flower? Well, I love the way it blooms and shines like the sun. A bouquet of thousands - in one \"flower\" and this flower is the sunflower. The yellow petals and a dark and mystic centre that most of us think of as a sunflower isn't really one sunflower—it's hundreds of them. And this fact fascinates me. But, it is not my favourite flower for the mysticism it holds, rather the beauty it symbolises. My grandmother has a garden full of sunflowers and it attracted butterflies and bees to our landscape and this flower truly filled my childhood with animation and ecstasy."

I have a pot containing the plant of this flower in my room and they are a constant reminder of the beauty of nature to me. This is a great source of fresh fragrance for my living area also. People often term the flower as orchid queen for its beauty and extraordinary features. I would like to thank you for this opportunity to let me talk about my favourite flower.\n\nThe Corsage Orchid plant requires ample light and air to grow. A moderate temperature is a must for the plant to grow. The temperature, as referred by the pot plant experts, needs to be between 50 and 70-degree Fahrenheit. But the growers should mindful to protect leaves from excessive sunburn. It is better if someone can manage an open area to grow the plant. Since the plant requires little care to grow, it is popular both among professional and amateur gardeners.        \n\nBrazil is located in the eastern part of South America. The climatic condition of the country supports the growth of such flower plants. Consequently, the flowers are available in plenty in Brazil. The history of Corsage Orchid to get the national flower status is interesting. Someone discovered this strange flower from some random leaves in Brazil and a few years later, the flower bloomed and enchanted everyone.\n\nCorsage Orchid flower looks gorgeous and its fragrance makes me feel relaxed. The amazing colour of the flower is sure to enchant everyone and they last for a long. A large variety of this flower makes it more attractive to people. They shine brightly. So, I like the flower very much."

In fact, I have been disappointed in life, even in situations, when I didn’t need to be. But, today, I would like to talk about something which I was genuinely disappointed with.\n\nIt was at a time when we were going to celebrate the 5th birthday of my handsome nephew about a couple of years ago. By the way, this particular birthday was very special for my little nephew because he couldn’t get his most favourite uncle, which was me, by his side when he celebrated his last birthday. In fact, he was very sad because of the fact that I couldn’t attend his birthday last year.\n\nSo, anyway, we arranged everything, including decorating the house, inviting friends of the birthday boy, buying all kinds of birthday gifts and choosing the perfect birthday dress, to have a perfect birthday. As for the birthday cake, we went to one of the best and most popular bakery shops in our town, apparently in an effort to order for the best cake. We provided all kind of specifications and instructions to the manager of the shop as to how the cake should have been prepared. By the way, it was going to be a German Chocolate cake with coconut in it and cherry slices on top. We also paid an extra amount of money to have the cake delivered in its original shape. Anyway, the birthday finally arrived, and so did the birthday cake except, of course, it was broken.  Needless to say, I felt very disappointed after seeing the cake in such a mess.  \n\nAnyway, after seeing the cake broken, I felt like the bakery shop was not serious enough about delivering the cake in a careful manner. Besides, the unfortunate incident made me feel a bit embarrassed also in front of all the guests. In fact, I felt like it was the worst thing that could ever happen at my nephew’s birthday."

It reminds me of an unpleasant event that I am going to share with you.\n\nA few months ago, my physics teacher refused my entry to the class in college.

The teacher, Victor Douglas, did not allow me in his class though I tried to persuade him about the reasons for my delay.\n\nI was late for around 15 minutes owing to severe traffic congestion on the streets of Manaus, located in the north region of Brazil. I left home earlier but could not reach my college in time.\n\nI was disappointed because I missed the class and could not take the class test. Mr Victor is very punctual and always maintain a rigid timetable. So it was natural that he denied my late entry to his class. I was not angry with him, rather I felt ashamed for being late.

I was supposed to catch the train that leaves from Kuala Lumpur's KL Sentral Railway Station and arrive at Penang's Butterworth Railway Station on the mainland, just 15 minutes away by ferry to George Town on Penang Island.\n\nIt was on a Friday in early January in 2018 and I left my home to reach the KL Sentral Railway Station that day as planned. My train schedule was at 8.30 in the morning and I left home before 6.00 am which should have given me enough time to reach the station considering the distance and usual traffic. However, I was utterly unfortunate that day. My taxi to the station malfunctioned at a deserted area on the route and I had to wait for 40 minutes or so to get another taxi. To add more woe, the road near the station was unusually congested due to an accident.\n\nI was very anxious and looked at my watch every five minutes or so and the taxi driver was trying his best to reach the station fast. But all efforts and prayers went in vain as I reached the station when it was already 8.45 am. To my dismay, the train had already left!\n\nI was speechless for about an hour and blamed myself for the misfortune. I was supposed to join two of my friends in Penang and have some great time together during our semester break. I said to myself \"Now that, I have missed my train, I will have to wait another 8 hours to get another train to Penang or maybe I should discard the whole idea and return home\". At a time my disappointment grasped me and I became discouraged. I called my friends, who were already in Penang, from a payphone at the station and despite their effort to persuade me to take the next train, I returned home with a broken heart."

    "Answer": "As a UK citizen, I find it really awkward to say that this great country doesn’t really have a unique “national day”, like any other sovereign countries in the world, in order to mark its “nationhood”.  Rather, it has a number of days of celebration for its “constituent countries”, such as St George's Day for England, St Andrew's Day for Scotland, St David's Day for Wales and St Patrick's Day for Northern Ireland. But, since I live in England, I will go ahead and describe St. George’s day as my national day.\n\nSaint George’s Day is celebrated on 23rd of April in order to mark the death of a famous patron saint of England called “Saint George”. 23rd of April, also known as “the feast of St. George”, is celebrated by many Christian churches across several countries and their cities of which Saint George is a patron saint.\n\nHistorically speaking, this particular tradition started by King Edward lll in the 14th century, even though, the incident took place many centuries ago in 303 AD, when Saint George was executed by decapitation because of refusing to recant his Christian faith. By the way, Saint George was a soldier of Cappadocian Greek origins and a member of the Praetorian Guard for Roman emperor Diocletian.  Anyway, Legends about this great saint started circulating in the 6th century, which eventually made him one of the most venerated saints and megalo-martyrs in Christianity. He has also been especially venerated as a military saint since the Crusades.  \n\nAuthorities across England fly the national flag to mark this day in a rather sober manner. Some villages put on fairs also, where the English folk Morris dance is performed, and some churches ring out the 'Jerusalem' hymn. Some pubs put on a “themed day” also.\n\nAnyway, I feel that it is great to remember this great saint who had a great role in bringing many Britons under the umbrella of Christian faith. This particular occasion also encourages many English villagers and their families to unite in a common cause which is really great for the solidarity of our people."

Many citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, household accessories and cars with replicas of the tri-colour of our national flag.\n\nHistorically, this is the most important day for us. India, as a nation, won its independence following the Independence Movement in 1947 and the birth of our nation was perhaps the most significant event in our history.  On 15 August 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi and the history took a new road on that special day.\n\nAs an Indian, I celebrate it by raising our national flag in our house and then attend the national parade in the early morning. I often take my siblings to our college's cultural programmes that highlight the significance of this day and the sacrifices we made as a nation to achieve our independence. I feel proud to be an Indian and this is the best day to live as an Indian."

    "Answer": "Germany, a land of diversity, has got some notable days to celebrate. The 'reunification day', or 'German Unity Day' is celebrated annually on October 3rd, and this is a national day for all Germans. Marking the reunification of Germany in 1990, we celebrate the day across the country and take part in different events. Before the unification of Germany, it was divided into two parts, but this unification has brought everything under a single curtain. This is a nice cue card topic for a candidate like me and I would love to answer it with great enthusiasm. Here goes the remaining answer...\n\nThe celebration of the day is important for us as a nation and it is a public holiday. Germans celebrate the day across the major cities of the country. Different ceremonial activities take place on this day and people participate in these activities spontaneously. The state capital, as well as a few non-state capitals, host the celebration and the political leaders often deliver their speeches. The celebrations in the host city always include a festival and fireworks show. The communal meal is another important part of celebrating this event.\n\nThe day is historically important. The idea of a unified Germany was underway since the middle of the 20th century. But the idea could not be materialized for numerous geopolitical reasons. The country experienced different political changes, several wars and those events did not allow the unification to happen. Finally, in 1990, after many attempts, the unification took place and the day has been observed as a national holiday ever since.\n\nI feel very passionate about celebrating this day and it has a great significance in the history of Germany. All the workplaces and services remain closed on that day except some emergency services and stores to meet the public needs. I love walking on the streets on this day and greet people. There are no public transports or crowds of office-goers on this day. But some points are excessively crowded with people celebrating the event and I feel proud to be a part of this celebration."

    "Answer": "Taking a car and hitting the road on a bright sunny day is one of my favourite things to do, when I have some free time to spare, and also when I get a little bored. The longer is the journey, the better it gets, as far as I am concerned. Today, I would like to talk about one such long car journey which I undertook about a year ago during the summer.\n\nOur destination was “Banff National Park” in Alberta. By the way, we were 4 friends all together, and we had earlier decided that we would travel to the famous park. But, the question was whether we would take an aerial route to arrive there or drive a car. After long “deliberation”, we finally decided that we would travel there by car because it was going to be more fun. But, it was going to be a long journey as it would have taken us approximately 7-10 hours, depending on the traffic situation.\n\nSo, we decided to hit the road real early with our “camper van” which was loaded with everything we needed, from under-seat luggage storage to a mini kitchen, and a cosy “penthouse” rooftop tent. By the way, since it was going to be a long journey, we would need to eat at least twice, while driving on the road, so we took veggie burgers with lettuce buns, eggs, cheese, and soy chorizo for breakfast scrambles, cheese tortellini with Pesto Sauce, camembert, crackers and plenty of water. There were several routes for us to take, but we decided to drive on Trans-Canada Highway number1 because it was the most scenic route of all.\n\nAnyway, I took this long car journey, primarily because I wanted to get out of the “boredom” of a very long and tiring work schedule of the previous months. Besides, I also wanted to see and enjoy the stunning views of Rocky Mountain peaks, turquoise glacial lakes, a picture-perfect mountain town and village, abundant wildlife and scenic drives from up close while driving to Canada’s first national park called “Banff National Park”."

    "Answer": "I went to St. Petersburg from Moscow a few months ago and I drove my car the whole time. It was a great experience for me. In fact, I, along with two of my friends, went there to attend the marriage ceremony of one of my cousins. Actually, he invited my family, but the family members were reluctant to attend the ceremony for the lengthy travel. So, I made the journey and took two of my friends with me. It was a fun experience for us and I would like to thank you for this nice cue card topic.\n\nIt took around 14 hours for us to reach St. Petersburg from my residence in Moscow. Actually, I could have reached there earlier, but I drove slowly considering the safety on the road. I never crossed the limit of 80 kilometres while I drove the car. Besides, we took a few breaks on the highway which also added an hour or so to our total travel time.\n\nBoris and Valery accompanied me on the journey. Both of them are my childhood friends and we have been brought up together. We live in the same community. Besides, our families also are on good terms with theirs. Thereby, I decided that if I take them with me, it will not be a problem at all.\n\nI decided to make the journey by car because my friends thought that it would be more fun and comfortable. Besides, air-tickets were expensive and we did not want to spend a large sum of money on our air tickets. I think we took the right decision as it was a great car journey for us. The beautiful road views and the favourite music on the car added a different dimension to our experience."

    "Answer": "Well, when we visit a city or some popular destinations in the world as international travellers, we usually try to visit some of their famous and interesting landmarks, museums or some other sites of great natural beauty. However, I had no idea that visiting a street could also be just as interesting as visiting those tourist attractions on any day.\n\nThe street, I am talking about, is called the “Oxford Street”, which is located right in the heart of the city of London. It runs all of the way from Tottenham Court Road to Marble Arch via Oxford Circus. People say that it is Europe's busiest shopping street, with around half a million daily visitors, which had approximately 300 shops, as of the year of 2012.  People head to this famous street because it allows them to do some affordable shopping in stores, like \"H & M,\" \"The Disney Store\" and \"Uniqlo\". However, if you are looking for more up-market high-street stores, you will also have your options in luxury brands like All Saints, Massimo Dutti and Aldo store, among others.  \n\nOxford Street also has a varied selection of shoe shops including Clarkes, Office and Nike town. Offering 1.5 miles of unrivalled shopping, from fashion and beauty to tech and homeware, Oxford Street is not only the ultimate shopping paradise but also a paradise for food lovers because they can eat at any of its 500 restaurants without actually walking more than five minutes.  Of course, I didn’t have the time to visit all of those restaurants and enjoy their food, but at least, I visited one of them after buying a very unique boutique item.  \n\nAnyway, I enjoyed visiting this world-famous street, not only because it offered so many choices in shopping, but also because I could meet and see so many different kinds of people, with different cultures, language, and backgrounds, from around the whole world. Finally, I enjoyed visiting this street also because I felt like the sun never set in this street as it was illuminated with all kinds of bright lights."

    "Answer": "My recent business trip to California was a huge success, and I had some spare hours to kill in the city. So, I went to see some of the notable locations in the city and the 'Hollywood Boulevard' - a large street, was an exceptional one in my list. It was one of the most impressive streets I have ever been to.\n\nThe street had beautiful buildings on both sides. Gorgeously decorated stores that sell all sorts of products were another appeal of it. The livelihood of the street and its beauty took my heart away. Being there was a fascinating experience for me.\n\nThis is an outstanding boulevard in the city and it runs through Hollywood. It connects more than seven other streets and is big enough to walk on foot to reach the end. The street is decorated with palm trees and they look more bustling at night. I guess the colourful decoration has something to do with it.\n\nI went there for the first time when I was nine or ten years old. One of my uncles used to live there and I spent a few months in the area. This time I went to revisit the street as it was a part of some beautiful memories. My uncle no longer lives there, but still, I went there.\n\nI stood at a corner of the street and gazed at the structures standing on both sides of the street. Then I walked for a few minutes and did some window shopping. Finally, I took a cup of tea from a bistro and spent some idle time at a cafe.\n\nI went to visit this street as it was once a known place to me and I miss those days. Being there was nostalgic but I felt good. The street is a major tourist attraction and people from all around the world come here. Besides, the street view was excellent. I took some photos of the street and thought to return there again someday."

    "Answer": "Australia is a great country which has gone through a number of significant events in its history in order to become the country which it is today. However, no other events are probably as significant in this country’s historical passage as the one, that I am about to describe very shortly, as this very event actually helped in creating Australia.\n\nThis particular significant event took place on 26th of January in the year of 1788 when the first fleet of British ships arrived at Port Jackson of the New South Wales. Besides, the raising of the flag of Great Britain at Sydney Cove by the then Sydney governor, Arthur Phillip, also took place on this same day, which essentially paved the way for the creation of a country called “Australia”.\n\nLater on, after a century or so, of course, this day was declared as the “national day” of Australia even though the Aboriginal Australians think otherwise about this particular historic event. In fact, the Aboriginal Australians consider this day, when this historic event took place, as a “national day of mourning” or “invasion day”. Of course, other European traders and explorers had started to make contact with the indigenous Australian people before 250 years earlier, but they didn’t claim any land until after Captain James cook formally had claimed New South Wales for British. This Aboriginal land was taken over by British colonists, on the premise that the land belonged to no-one (‘terra nullius’), either by using “force” against the indigenous people or purchasing their lands from them.\n\nAnyway, it is a significant historic event for my country because in the aftermath of this event, On New Year's Day 1901, the British colonies of Australia eventually were able to form a federation, marking the birth of modern Australia. Besides, this is a significant historical event also because it allows us to reflect on our past history and mistakes as a nation and then rectifying them by calling for national unity among the people of a very diverse Australian society."

    "Answer": "The assassination of Abraham Lincoln is one of the most significant events in the history of the USA. Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes, a renowned actor of that time. Wilkes was a sympathizer of the Confederate and it was an act of vengeance for him to kill Lincoln - according to his testimony. Interestingly, a couple of weeks ago, Lincoln had dreamt of an assassination event and shared it with some of his security officials. But he could not survive the day finally. This is an interesting cue card task and here are the remaining answers in brief.\n\nThe assassination took place on April 14, 1865. It was a gloomy evening when John Wilkes killed the president. It was a kind of revenge from the belief that Lincoln was the root cause for damaging the South while the assassinator thought that Lincoln dishonoured people and the institutions of South America. So, he planned to kill Lincoln. The president was delivering a speech before audiences when he was shot.\n\nIt was one of the worst moments for the nation when Abraham Lincoln was murdered. He was a great man and loved the countrymen. He underwent 'unwanted situations’ but handled most of them successfully. His assassination was a great loss for the country. Abraham Lincoln was shot in the back of his head and he went into a coma for around nine hours. He did not wake up from the coma and finally died.\n\nThis is an important historical event for the USA. Abraham Lincoln tried to make the country united, played an important role to abolish slavery and took many other great initiatives. In line with the assassination, some other events also took place to destroy the administration of Abraham Lincoln. Sadly, it was a great loss for us. Later, a manhunt was conducted to search out the assassinator, John Wilkes."

    "Answer": "Learning a different language always helps, especially, if someone wants to improve his/her career and wants to learn about the culture and traditions of another country. However, here I want to talk about one particular language, which I really like to learn, is called “Mandarine”.\n\nMandarine, the language of about 1.5 billion people all over the world, is mostly spoken by the people in the South-East Asian countries, including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau. It is also spoken by many Chinese expatriates who are living in the USA, Canada, Australia and many European countries.\n\nAnyway, even though, learning Mandarine can be a quite challenging task, especially for an English speaking “American” like me, I think that I can still learn it easily if I stick with my plans. And, my plan includes practising alone with my textbooks, written in Mandarine and meeting a few Mandarine speaking friends both online and offline. I also plan to enrol in a Mandarine learning school. I am also planning to see more Chinese movies in order to understand the different tone and pronunciation methods of the Mandarin language. Besides, after already learning a few basic facts about Mandarine, such as how learning 1000 commonly used characters would help me recognize 90% of the characters in Chinese newspapers, and how straightforward is Chinese grammar, now I am confident more than ever that I can easily learn this complex language. Finally, I am also planning to memorize some basic and simple Chinese vocabularies in order to become fluent quickly.\n\nAnyway, there are a couple of reasons for which I want to learn the mandarine. First, it would allow me to learn about the great culture of Chinese people in more details and objective manner. By the way, I also just to love to learn about different countries and culture in order to keep myself informed. Secondly, it would also allow me to avail better career opportunities in the future as more and more Chinese companies are becoming attractive places for working for professionals all over the world, including the USA."

    "Answer": "I would like to learn the Italian language for some specific reasons. Currently, I am living in Sri Lanka and have got a scholarship at an Italian university. So I have to travel to Italy soon. I am planning to learn Italian from any recognized language teaching centre in my country. In fact, I am searching for such an institute where I can learn the language. This is a great cue card topic and thanks for the opportunity to let me talk about it.\n\nThe Italian language is also known as lingua Italiana. Italian is a Romance language which is widely used in some parts of the world including Italy, San Mario, Switzerland, Malta, and Albania. Besides, it is also spoken in the USA by the Italian migrates. Since I am going to Italy, I need to have a good command over the language.\n\nLearning Italian would give me a competitive advantage once I am there. So, I think if I could know the language, it would be beneficial for me in the long run.\n\nI want to learn the language for several reasons. First of all, it will help me communicate with the people and particularly with my classmates and teachers. Moreover, there are some courses in Italian language and if I do not know the language, I would not be able to cross the examination barriers. Hence, knowing the language will be a huge advantage for me. On top of that, learning the language would help me understand many aspects of Italian culture and tradition which will be helpful to me once I am in Italy."

    "Answer": "For some unexplainable reasons, I have always felt a passion for learning the Chinese language. The idea of learning this language is rooted back in my teenage days when one of my aunts learned this language and often explained how the grammar and punctuation of this language work. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about this topic.\n\nThough I have always wanted to learn this language, I have never given serious thought about actually doing it, until a year ago. The aunt I have talked about is working as a mechanical engineer in Beijing, China and came to visit us a year ago. I had a few conversations about her life in China and at a time we discussed the language she uses to communicate. She explained how learning a new language can help us widen our perceptions and accommodates us to understand a new culture. After she left the country, I saw an advertisement from one of our local university about offering a six month's course to learn a second language for university students.\n\nAs soon as I learned that they offer a Chinese language course, I became interested. Though I have not started the course yet, I am determined to intake it next summer. The Chinese language has many varieties and I would specifically learn the standard Chinese language which is mainly spoken in China, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau. Standard Chinese is also called Mandarin and have some variations based on where it is spoken.\n\nI will not learn this language for any particular reason or for professional benefits. Rather, I would learn it from the sheer interests I feel about the language and Chinese culture. But, I believe that learning a foreign language always offers some hidden benefits. Though I am not sure, who knows, someday it might be proved to be a necessary skill!\n\nAs I have already stated, I would take the 6 month's language course at a local university and hopefully, that would give me a good grip on the basic of the language. After that, I will surely take advantage of the online resources to further enhance my skill in the Chinese language. Besides, I will have some friends, hopefully, from the language course, who would be a good fit for me to practise the language even after the course is over. Furthermore, I will have video conferences with my aunt who now lives in China and practise Chinese whenever possible. These are my plans to master the language but I am sure with the course of time, I would be able to devise some more intuitive ways of becoming proficient in Chinese."

While none of those ceremonies was any better or more special than the others, as far as I am concerned, I guess it is ok to remember some a bit more than the others. So thank you for offering me the opportunity to talk about one such special wedding ceremony.\n\nIt was the wedding ceremony of Alex, one of my best university friends, who I hadn’t seen for at least about a few years after our graduation from the university because we were living in different cities, which were far apart from each other. Besides, we were also very busy with our professional lives. So, when I received an invitation from Alex to attend his marriage, I felt really happy and excited, not only because it would allow me to witness one of the happiest days of my friend’s life, but also because I could finally meet him after a long time.\n\nAnyway, the wedding took place at a local church in the home town of Alex, which was magnificently decorated with a great colour scheme by matching it with the bride’s wedding dress and flowers. However, the marriage ceremony was rather brief which was conducted according to the Christian religious practices. Then came the wedding reception which was rather elaborate and eventful with the couple cutting the wedding cake, wedding party mingling with drinks and snack in their hands, and brief dancing by the newly-wedded couples.\n \nAnyway, it was a special wedding ceremony for me because I was made to be “the best man” on that day. Besides, I also contributed a little in the decoration ideas of the overall wedding ceremony, which was really appreciated by the guests there. The wedding was special to me also because it allowed me to meet many of my old day friends and catch up with them during a very happy event."

I was both exhilarated and sad at the same time and this would make me remember this ceremony for the rest of my life. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about it. \n\nThe marriage reception took place at our home, (...mention your city and country name here...) and almost two hundred guests including many relatives, neighbours and my parents’ colleagues, were present at the ceremony.\n\nMy younger sister, Bella, who is my only sister was getting wedded to his boyfriend- James. They had a 3 years’ relationship and after they got their parents’ blessings, they decided to tie the knot. In our country, it is almost a ritual that brothers would act as one of the main hosts when their sisters get married and I had no reason to be absent from my only sister's marriage ceremony. I was a university student at that time and the ceremony was arranged during my semester break. I was looking forward to being a part of the ceremony as I wanted a memorable wedding reminiscence for my loving sister. I had to look after many aspects of this programme and I happily did everything.\n\nThis was a special wedding to me as one of my most beloved persons was starting a new phase in her life. On the one hand, it gave me an immense joy that my sister was very happy to have a life partner she loved and on the other hand, the thought of her departure from our house almost brought tears to my eyes. I cannot remember any other event so touchy for me and this is a day I will always remember."

    "Answer": "Some people might argue otherwise, but I would certainly like to suggest that no trip to Toronto is complete without visiting the “Royal Ontario Museum” because it happens to be the largest museum of art, world culture and natural history in Canada. The museum attracts more than one million visitors every year from all over the world, making it the most visited museum in the country.\n\nWhen I visited the museum about a few years ago, I felt like I was looking at a “luminous beacon” (or a lighthouse), made of steel structure with aluminium cladding and prismatic forms of glasses, from outside as if it wants to make a bold statement to its visitors. But, what I saw, after entering the amazing looking museum complex, was what just blew away my mind because it was so huge inside with so many things to see, I would actually need the entire day, if not longer, to be able to see only a fraction of it.\n\nSo, I chose to use my common sense instead and decided to see only those exhibitions which were generally popular among the common visitors. Included among those exhibitions are a “granite bust of Cleopatra” (an image of ancient Egyptian goddess), the magnificent “Paradise of Maitreya”, a mural that once adorned the wall of a Chinese Buddhist monastery, back in the days of Khubilai Khan and Marco Polo, and the bat cave (presenting bats in a simulated natural habitat to show how bats use echolocation to navigate at night). Then, I also saw a lot of dinosaurs fossils and skeletons, some of which were even real and original bones, among many other collections.\n\nAnyway, I really liked visiting this museum because it allowed me to wander around without any bar or restriction. Of course, the layout was also great, exhibits were all well designed and interactive, and the information was easily absorbed. In fact, I would dare suggest that there were definitely something for everybody to see and enjoy. Finally, the exhibitions were great overall and they all came at a fair price."

The exhibits of the museum were perfumes from different times and categories. In fact, the idea of exhibiting perfumes and perfume bottles was a bit unusual to me. Later, I realized that it was good to be there and I felt wonderful with the displays of the museum. This is a nice candidate task card and I am feeling lucky to have it in my share.\n\nI went to the museum last February. The museum is located in Paris where I went to close a business deal. I got some leisurely hours to spend after a successful business meeting. Then I decided to visit any of the notable places in the city and went to this museum. This was a private museum that began its journey in 1983. The mansion where the museum is located looks delicate with its Napoleonic style.\n\nI was attracted by the name of the museum. At first, I thought it might be a majestic perfume selling shop but later I was thrilled with the exhibitions of the museum. The building looked strikingly beautiful and the perfume collections of different ages were something worth enjoying. Luckily, I got a guided tour and came to know about the history of perfume and their brands. I witnessed the perfume of different eras and was informed about the perfumery items of those ages.\n\nI liked this museum as it reveals the secret of perfume and informs the visitors about the history of perfumes of different ages. It preserves a remarkable number of items related to perfume production and located in the centre of the city. And there was no entry fee to access this museum. I was thrilled about the concept and enjoyed my time there."

In fact, whenever I visit a new city or a new country, I try to go to famous museums there to learn more about its history, culture, people and the way of life. For this cue card topic, I would like to talk about the ‘National Museum of Australia’, that I visited more than once and which is one of the best museums I have ever been to.\n\nAs far as I know, this museum was established in 1980, not a long ago, and it is located in Acton, Australia. This museum preserves and interprets the social history of Australia and represents the people and events that have primarily shaped the country. It is a prominent witness of Australia's history. I went to visit the museum in 1999 for the first time with my father. I was merely a teenager at that time. However, I went there with some of my friends in 2016 for the second time and the memory of my visit is still fresh.\n\nMy latest visit to the museum was a fabulous experience. I learned that this is the world's largest museum in terms of its collection of Aboriginal bark painting. It has more than 50 thousand years of indigenous heritage and prolific collections of different events of Australian history. It is a must visiting place for anyone interested in Australian history. This museum is also famous for its publications of a wide range of books, journals and catalogues besides the innovative technology it usages that have brought an international reputation for the museum.\n\nThe location of the museum is another attraction to the visiting tourists as it is situated on the Acton peninsula and it offers a great view both from the inside and outside. I was taken aback by the splendid and memorable way it has decorated its entrance, a unique design for a museum.\n\nAnyone will find so many reasons to like this museum and I adored it specifically for its outstanding design, use of technology and unique collections. Visiting this museum was like witnessing the past and I felt like I had been time travelling to the past. I liked it so much that I would like to visit it again someday."

It is on the 4th floor of the Grand Royal Plaza building which is just 3 blocks away from my university. Thank you, sir/madam, for this lovely cue card topic.\n\nStudents, teachers and office executives who love coffee, milkshake, tea, fast food and like to play billiards mostly visit this coffee shop. Though this shop has a menu with over 20 items, coffee is their hot selling product. I sometimes drink tea or eat a sandwich, but most of the time I go there to have a refreshing cup of hot coffee. They sell both hot and cold coffee and as far as I recall, they have more than 20 variations of the coffee they serve.\n\nI would easily attest them as the best coffee maker in the town. I love their coffee and mainly visit this shop for that. The opportunity to play billiards for free seems like a discount to me! Apart from that, they have a great environment and polite and professional staff to serve the customers. I sometimes sit there to chat with my friends or pass an hour and there is no rush to empty the seat for a new customer.\n\nI love their music choice, interior design, and friendly attitude. They even offer a complimentary menu to regular customers. The only thing I dislike about them is the time they take to serve an item. It’s like I have to wait around 20-25 minutes every time I order something! The delay, I guess, irritates office executives who are in a hurry! I have notified them about it and their explanation to my complaint was something like - ‘We take time to serve a customer because we value quality and the taste. And to ensure the taste, we give our best effort.’ The response might seem a little lame to others, but I don’t mind waiting for a few extra minutes especially when I have time to kill or have some friends with me to talk to."

    "Answer": "Shopping is one of my least favourite things to do, but unfortunately, life doesn’t exactly care whether I like it or not. So, I have to go to a shop regardless. But, to make my “shopping job” little less troubling, I have picked up one particular shop – a super shop that is – which I would like to talk about.\n\nAs I have mentioned earlier, it is a “super shop” which is only about a few minutes drive from where I live. But, since it is not really located at some popular part of the city, this super shop has remained “obscure” to many city-dwellers for the most part. But, still, this super shop attracts a rather large number of shoppers from all walks of life who almost regularly visit this shop. In fact, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to suggest that most of the customers of this particular shop consider it as their “family super shop” because they have built up a special relationship with its staffs.  Here it is worth mentioning that it is not exactly a very big shop, probably not more than 1000 square feet, and so even a small gathering of customers in it at any given time would make this super shop look rather crowded.\n\nAnyway, the visitors of this super shop can be anybody, from regular factory workers to top executives of some big companies, who visit it in order to meet their daily shopping needs, be it buying just a loaf of bread or some fruits and vegetables. The super shop also offers other products and merchandises like cosmetics, perfumes, dairy products, toiletries, small kitchen appliances, meat products, fish and different kinds of snacks among other things.  \n\nAnyway, I like visiting this shop mainly because it is very close to my home. Great customer services and relatively cheaper prices on many of its products, and the availability of some fresh fruits and vegetables are some of the reasons for which I like to visit this super shop. Finally, I like this shop because it remains clean and tidy most of the times."

    "Answer": "The store, named “The Daily Shop”, is located near the place where I live in the city of Samsun in Turkey. This is a large superstore and sells a wide variety of products. The shop has many positive aspects. First of all, it is accessible from any part of the city for its geographical location. Further, the interior decoration of the shop is admirable. This is an interesting cue card topic and I am glad to have it. I will answer the reaming questions and describe the shop in brief. And thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about it.\n\nThis store is open to all and they have numerous types of commodities. People often go there to purchase products for their household use. Besides, this a good place to pick a gift item for someone. I guess the number of adult-male customers is higher than females and children on an ordinary day. On a weekend, however, more female customers could be seen. I am not sure why this is the case but I guess female shoppers prefer shopping on weekends rather than weekdays!\n\nThe shop mostly sells the daily necessaries like the canned food, toiletries, cosmetics, fruits, groceries, vegetables, dairy products, fish, packaged food, various types of meats like beef, chicken, soft beverages like juice and the list goes on. \n\nI appreciate their efforts to ensure the quality of each product. I frequently visit the shop as it is adjacent to my residence. So, while returning from my office, I go there to buy something I need at home. And I sometimes visit this store to check their latest collection of toiletries and perfumes. I also like the way they serve the clients."

    "Answer": "I have always remained a very vocal “opponent” of borrowing anything from anybody either because it would put a question mark on my “financial ability” or present me as a “miserly” person to others. But, necessity knows no bounds, and I also needed to borrow something, a scientific calculator that is, from one of my distant relatives.\n\nIt was about 10 years ago, when I was still a high school student, and I was eagerly waiting to get over with my final term examination. Everything was going well as I was finishing taking one test after another until the day to appear for the “Trigonometry” test had arrived. As usual, I was ready to get out of my house and hit the road in order to take part in the “Trigonometry” test. But, unfortunately, just when I was checking my calculator for the last time to make sure if it was in good working condition, I found out to my extreme “horror” that it wasn’t working at all! I checked the battery (which I had put only the previous month) and everything else by pushing all the “buttons” one after another, but it just wouldn’t switch on. So, I immediately decided to run to a nearby local store in order to buy the same kind of calculator, but all I could expect there was some “huge disappointment” as it didn’t have any scientific calculator to sell.\n\nAt this point, I felt very “helpless”. But, just when I was about to give up my hope to get a calculator, I thought of asking one distant math teacher relative of mine to rescue me. And, what a rescue it really was!\n\nAnyway, I needed to borrow the calculator because travelling to different stores one after another, without actually knowing which store was selling that type of calculator, would surely make me late for my test. I had to borrow the scientific tool also because, without it, I couldn’t really do much in my “Trigonometry” test as far as the issue of getting a good grade was concerned."

    "Answer": "I would like to thank you for the opportunity you have given me to talk about something I once borrowed from a friend or a relative. To be honest, I can recall many such events when I had to turn to a friend or family member for something I required. However, for this cue card topic, I will talk about an event when I borrowed two thousand dollars from my father.\n \nJust after finishing college, I, along with two of my friends, planned to start a small business. It was 2016 and I was convinced to be a partner of the proposed business and that's why borrowed the money from my father. Besides my university, I got serious about our new venture and I had been able to return the money within a year that I took from my father as a loan. When I returned the money to my father, he seemed surprised and I explained how our interior design venture is flourishing day by day. He told me that he was quite astonished that our little enterprise eventually saw the light of success.\n \nI thanked him for the money and explained how we worked together to make it a success. I also showed my gratitude and mentioned that without his money, I could not have been a part of this business.\n \nIn numerous times, I borrowed books, laptops, music player, money, CDs and so on from my friends and relatives but the two thousand dollars that I took from my father was something quite different and I am lucky that I decided to borrow it from my father for a good reason which is eventually paying off."

I am an undergraduate student and I took the History of Ancient Civilizations course in my fourth semester. I needed the book as I lost mine and needed to get some information to complete an important assignment.\n \nI borrowed the book “History and Our Footsteps” from Hien Long. He is a good friend of mine and lives near my residence. He is a helpful person and lent me the book though he needed it for the same purpose. I was happy to have the book and Long also was delighted that he could help me.\n \nI needed the book urgently to get some information to prepare an assignment that I was due to submit in a week. Unfortunately, I lost my book and did not know how it was lost! If I failed to submit the assignment, it might have been difficult for me to pass the course. As I remember, it was a comparatively easier assignment and took only a few hours for me to complete but I could not have done it without having the textbook as a reference.\n \nI knew that I would require the book to complete the assignment but I could not buy it right then. So, I sought help from Long as he lived nearby. I asked him to lend me the book and I promised to return it the next day. He was supportive enough and came to my home with the book and then I completed the assignment. I thanked him heartily for his genuine help."

    "Answer": "There are many well-paid jobs in the job markets, and I feel like I would be good at doing many of them without much difficulties (forgive me if I sound a bit too “confident” here). But, for the lack of time, I am allowed to talk about only one of those jobs here.\n\nThe job is more popularly known as “Foreign Affairs Analyst”, which has fascinated me since my high school days, not only because it pays well, but also because it is different from any other jobs in some significant ways. For example, no other jobs allow a person to represent his or her country to the rest of the world in such a comprehensive manner, like the job of a foreign affair analyst, by analyzing its strengths and weaknesses on different levels of political, economic and geo-strategic objectives.  However, some people might argue here that corporate jobs also do the same thing, but, in response, I would say that they conduct such analysis only on a “micro” level while a Foreign Affairs Analyst does that on a “macro” level. Another distinct aspect of this job is that it involves extensive travelling to different countries and residing there for a long period of time, unlike many other jobs, so that the job holders can study the activities of those countries closely in order to secure the national interests of his/her country.  By the way, while anybody with a tertiary educational qualification can do the job of a foreign affairs analyst, it would rather be better if he/she at least has a Bachelor degree or equivalent qualifications in “International Relation” or “Political Science’.\n\nAnyway, I think that I would be good at this job primarily because I have been very passionate about learning about different cultures, traditions and lifestyles of different countries, which certainly could come handy for an aspiring foreign affairs analyst. In fact, I have even travelled to a number of our neighbouring countries in the past. Besides, my “above average” negotiation skills and “tact”, would help me to do the job better than many other people."

    "Answer": "The job of a ‘Sales Manager’ in Germany is surprisingly challenging and at the same time, highly rewarding. This job is well-paid and comes with many other benefits. Hence, a good number of candidates in my country try to get the job and grow their career as a sales manager. I think I will be an accomplished sales manager if I am given the opportunity. This is a nice cue card topic and I would like to thank you for the chance to let me talk about it.\n \nThe position of a sales manager requires at least a graduation degree from a reputed university or college. The degree should be focused on finance, marketing, business or any other similar discipline. Without proper knowledge of the marketing system, someone would struggle to set the right strategies for achieving sales target. A company will be expecting results from a sales manager.\n \nUsually, other jobs come with fewer challenges while the job of a sales manager brings constant hurdles and not to mention the difficult sales targets and obstacles of managing a large team. Failure is not accepted in this position. Sales managers grow amid the challenges and establish their companies as brand entities in the market. Moreover, the reward of this job is high. The sales managers always get benefits for their efforts and success.\n \nBeing a student of business studies, I am gathering the required academic skills to be a sales manager for a large brand. Besides, I have some part-time job experience in this field and have been working in a product manufacturing company for the last two years. My skills in analysing the market and understanding the target audience along with my persuasive skills make me a deserving candidate for this job. However, there is a catch! I can't apply for this post directly. I will have to prove myself as a salesperson first and then be promoted as a sales manager who would be responsible for managing a large team of other salesmen."

    "Answer": "Oh! This is a great candidate task card topic to talk about and I would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about a job which is both well-paid and a perfect match for me.\n \nDuring my preparation time for this topic, I thought about 4-5 high-paid professions and finally decided that I would be a great lawyer. In my country, the average wage for experienced lawyers is higher than many other mentionable professions.\n \nTo be a lawyer, someone must obtain a bachelor's degree first and then apply to a law school. After someone earns a law degree from the law school, he/she must then pass the bar exam to gain a licence to start practising or to represent a client to the court. Some states may require aspiring lawyers to take some additional examinations and pass them to be fully approved to practice law. However, some top law firms recruit only from the very best universities. These law firms invite tops scorers who are smart, talented, diligent and achievers. After a certain time, experience, knowledge and tactics become the main requirements to shine in this profession.\n \nThe lawyers deal with the legislative system for a country- make it, change it and abide by it. They sometimes defend a criminal while at points prosecute someone. It is often said that greatest dramas do not take place in theatres, rather they are played in a courtroom and from this regards, lawyers are often the directors and actors of such dramas. They work sometimes in the shadow, yet their contribution is prominent. Every profession has its unique features, but this seems more vibrant, diverse, challenging and rewarding for lawyers. At least this is my impression of this profession.\n \nI have completed my graduation from the law faculty of (...say a university name…). Though my parents expect me to be a judge -  a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges, I feel differently. I want to be a defense lawyer as I feel an uncanny attraction and passion towards this profession and hopefully, I will be a great defense lawyer, often knows as a barrister, someday. I believe saving a single innocent person from being convicted wrongfully is quite a noble job.\n \nSo far I have a good academic record and I believe I would be awarded a law degree from a renowned foreign university to be recruited by a top-notch law firm in my home country. That would just be the kick-start I need to start a long, challenging, noble and rewarding professional journey."

    "Answer": "We all use imagination, consciously or unconsciously, as it allows us to experience a whole new world in our minds, speaking “philosophically” of course. But, sometimes, imagination is also needed to avoid some “awkward” situations.\n\nMy nephew, about 5 years old, was notorious for making “impossible” demands from time to time when he was not in a good mood. So, when my sister left the town for a few days (in order to take care of some important business) and asked me to look after their child, I immediately knew that I was in for some “big” troubles! And, it didn’t take too long to prove myself right as soon as I failed to feed into his demand of buying him “chocolate ice cream” (prohibited by their parents on some medical grounds).\n\nBut, my nephew wasn’t just willing to let go of his “demand” for his favourite snack unless I was “preparing” (not “buying”) him something more unique in their kitchen which, in this particular situation, would be “chocolate mixed apple pie”. Of course, the problem was I didn’t have any idea about preparing “chocolate mixed apple pie” nor could I find any particular “recipe” for this unique “dessert”. Suddenly, I thought that it perhaps would be better if I could somehow convince my “stubborn” nephew to unearth some of his cooking skills and get him to cook the “unique” dessert for himself while I would just work as an assistant to him. And guess what, the idea worked like a “magic” as he immediately agreed to take my “bait” and forgot about preparing the very dessert altogether!   \n\nAnyway, I felt really relieved after seeing my plan had a great calming effect on my nephew. After all, I didn’t want my nephew to think of me as a rude or “unloving” uncle as I was not willing to buy his favourite snack. Besides, I also felt really happy about my plan as it allowed me to share some fun and quality time with my nephew in a kitchen which otherwise perhaps wouldn’t be possible."

I will tell you when it was, why I was in a situation to use my imagination, what hurdles I faced and my overall impressions of the whole event.\n \nTo commence with, it happened approximately a year ago when my family shifted to a new apartment. My previous room was comparatively smaller than the one I got at that new flat and I had only a small number of furniture back then. The new room, on the contrary, was large and I had to plan to decorate it carefully. I wanted to give my room a delightful ambience and to do so, I had to face a big challenge. While I was in the planning phase, my elder sister had already tidied up her room in an adorable fashion. This made my challenges even more complicated.\n \nI had a savings of my own and I bought two oil-paintings, a large rag, a new sofa set, decorative wall stickers and some pot plants with the money. Then I was confronted with the real challenge of placing them in the perfect position. My imagination was already at work and it took me two days to finish decorating my room. I must have been very creative as my father, who scarcely appreciate, remarked very emphatically. I felt quite relieved and exhilarated at the same time for this achievement. My imagination, choice and creativity to prepare my room in a way inspired me to plan everything beforehand from that event.\n \nI am sure my elder sister had never agreed but with the pot plants, oil paintings, decorative wall stickers and stylish sofa, my room looked better than that of her! I felt a sense of accomplishment and a great pleasure."

    "Answer": "I studied history at the University of Guilan and completed my graduation from that very university in 2017. In my early years, I often found myself in a position in which I was yet to complete the whole syllabus before the exam. Thus I was often forced to use my imagination during the written tests! If I look back to these days, I feel kind of proud for my ability to score well with my capacity to imagine the scenario and then pen down the answers. But, I soon changed my habit to secure better grades.\n \nDuring the semester final in my second year, I completely relied on my imagination and memory to answer one of the questions related to the Ottoman Empire. I would like to talk about this event and this is a lovely cue card task for me.\n \nI often skimmed textbooks before an exam and could write the answers and my regular attendance to the class and ability to recall teachers' lectures saved me many times. However, a very hard question related to the Ottoman Empire baffled me on an exam and I had to rely on my imagination to answer it.\n \nDealing with this was not easy, especially in an exam room. Firstly, I had little idea about what I should be writing and the time was ticking. I had some knowledge about the Ottoman Empire and I used it to expand the stories and I explained the event in very own way! It might sound absurd but I got a good mark on this test!\n \nThis particular event was a lesson for me. Though I felt proud to be able to answer questions without memorising them, I felt I ought to be more careful to get a better grade and properly studying before the exam was the only solution to it. I did not abandon my creative writing approach but became more serious about studying after this experience."

    "Answer": "This is quite an interesting topic for me and I would like to profoundly thank you for allowing me to describe an event when my imagination saved my day.\n \nIt was roughly two years ago when the quote by the greatest scientist Albert Einstein -  “Imagination is more important than knowledge\", was proven correct once again in my life. I was in a job interview and the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the company asked me a very tricky question. If I recall everything precisely, it was my second job interview after my graduation and I was terribly apprehensive to face interviews at that time. The question the COO asked was nothing I was prepared for. He asked me whether I did my homework about their company and products and as soon as I said ’yes’, his next question came to me as a shock. He told me to describe a few negative aspects of this company or the things they are doing wrong. He also asked me to propose a solution to the problem.\n \nI was silent for around 5-10 seconds and noticed that every one of the interview panels was looking at me very sternly. And that made the whole situation more challenging for me. I took another 10 seconds to start talking and I decided to express my true feelings about the downside of their company. I had to be very imaginative and creative and I decided to express some faulty ways they were operating their business. Talking about poor customer management system they have had and how their competitors had gained more market share over the past few years was not easier and I did not tell everything from my knowledge, rather I let my imagination take control. Proposing the solution to this problem was not easier either but when I let my imagination dictate me, I noticed some interests in the eyes of the interviewers.\n \nThis all happened in the blink of an eye, or maybe this is what I felt. The interviewers' eye contact with each other persuaded me that I was on the right track. The interview prolonged for another twenty minutes or so and I felt the room with a great deal of confidence.\n \nI felt positive and confident and the thank goes to my timely imaginative power. I believe our imagination is highly related to our knowledge and experience and it can often be more powerful than we think it actually would be.\n \nBefore I end my answer to this cue card topic, I would like to inform you that I actually was offered the position in this company and I still work for them."

But, that’s exactly what I did about a year ago when my aunt left her “bundle of joy” (my baby “cousin”) for me to take care of because she needed to go out for a few hours.\n\nAnyway, I knew that I needed to be “extra” careful in making sure that he wasn’t crying. And, to do so, I was holding and carrying him very gently. Of course, this is what my aunt instructed me in order to make him fall asleep. But the problem was I wasn’t succeeding. So, I took him in front of a TV and make him watch some cartoons even though I wasn’t too sure that he was “old” enough to enjoy cartoons! Anyway, this far, he was behaving like a “good” boy. But, then came the real challenge when he started to cry, but all I could do at that time was to try to “talk” to him with some “funny” faces in order to distract him. But, unfortunately, I wasn’t making much of an impression on my baby cousin so that he could actually stop crying. Then I suddenly remembered that he was probably hungry, and he needed his baby “feeder”, and as soon as I gave him his “feeder”, he got busy in “nourishing” himself from it until he fell asleep. Fortunately, he slept until my aunt returned.\n\nAnyway, initially, I was a bit nervous about taking care of my “baby cousin”, but as time progressed, I actually started to enjoy the “responsibility”. In fact, it was really interesting to see how that little “wonder baby” tried to “communicate” with me with some “funny sounds” from time to time except, of course, the problem was that this “poor” cousin could not understand what I told him! Besides, I also felt good that I could actually help my aunt when nobody was around to help her."

I would like to thank you for this opportunity to let me talk about my experience of looking after this baby.\n \nIt would be around six months ago when I had to stay home the whole day with my nephew, Ethan, who was merely 3 years old. Usually, my nephew is very adorable and gentle in nature but when he cries out loud, I find it hard to do anything to console him and bring him back to his normal jolly state. When Ethan's parents are around and he begins to cry, I keep my distance as my previous experience has taught me that anything I do makes thing worse!\n \nEthan's parents had to go out for the whole day and there was none except me to look after the baby. Ethan was a good boy most of the day and he caused me no trouble about which I was afraid of. I fed him twice the meal his mom prepared beforehand, changed his diaper and dresses, caressed him, tried to make him happy by acting and making different sounds and was very cautious to make sure he was comfortable. He slept for a couple of hours and during that time I sat beside him and read a book.\n \nAt first, I was intimidated because I did not want to take full responsibility for the baby while his parents were away. However, as time passed, I started feeling confident that he would be okay with me and at a time, I started feeling happy to be with him. That day I realised that looking after a baby is not as frightening as I thought it would be but it takes a great deal of effort to make sure the baby is okay.\n \nI actually enjoyed being with Ethan and the way he played, laughed and hugged me was something totally new to me."

It reminds me of an event when my closest friend Bella had to visit her hometown to see a sick relative. It would be approximately two years ago and coincidently, her husband was out of the town at that time. So she requested me to look after her daughter - Irene.\n \nWhen Bella requested me to look after Irene for a couple of days, I told her that I would be glad to babysit her little Irene. Irene was six years old then and a very nice girl. I asked Bella to bring some of Irene's favourite clothes and toys, just to make her feel at home at my place. You know, kids may feel nervous in a totally new environment, and I thought her belongings will soothe her and make her feel more at ease.\n \nI prepared her breakfast and lunch and usually took her out for dinner. As she had classes, I had to drop her at her school in the morning and pick her up in the evening as well. I tried my best to cheer her up so that she would not miss her parents much. She stayed three days at my place and I even took her to a children's park nearby, which is open to the public and adored by many children.\n \nHow did I feel? Well- it was a new experience for me and honestly speaking, I was a bit nervous at the beginning as I had no prior experience of looking after babies. But Irene was a sweet child and we had a great time together. I even missed her after she left my house. She gave me a nice pot plant as a gesture of her gratitude after a few days and mentioned to her mom that she had a great time at my home."

    "Answer": "After graduating from the university and entering into a career, I don’t really get much time to spend with my friends. Besides, as people get older, their priorities in life change. Therefore, it is not always possible to meet our friends and spend time with them despite our best intention. However, I will still try my best to give an account of how I usually spend my time with my friends.\n\nAnyway, as I have already mentioned earlier that I don’t really get much time to spend with my friends except probably a couple of times in a month mostly during the weekend, the good thing is whenever we meet, we try to make the best use of our time. One of the things, which we really enjoy doing together, is that sometimes we take a long drive to a big lake outside of my home town in order to do fishing. Of course, most of my friends don’t exactly like to eat fish, but I do. So, while my friends are busy releasing the fishes back into the water after catching them, I keep myself busy in putting them in back except, of course, the only problem is I don’t get to catch as many fishes as my friends. Another thing, which I really like to do, is to visit a local movie theatre and watch a great movie together with my friends. Then, after finishing watching the movie, we also hit one of our favourite restaurants and enjoy some great foods while poking jokes at each other and having fun.\n\nWell, I enjoy spending time with my friends a lot as it helps me get refreshed and rejuvenated myself after a long and busy week. Besides, meeting with my friends allows me an opportunity to talk about an array of issues so that we can remain informed and smart. Finally, spending time with friends sometimes allows us to do some social works/charity works. We enjoy a certain sense of peace in our minds which wouldn’t be possible otherwise."

I will tell you how I usually spend time with my close buddies, what I do with them, where we go and how often I meet them.\n \nWell, to begin with, I have more than ten friends and three of them are very intimate friends of mine. I meet those close friends two to three times a week on an average and sometimes more than that.\n \nWhenever I am with those friends, we have endless topics to talk about and our conversations continue for hours. Sometimes we talk about ourselves, our family, sports we like, celebrities we admire, people we hate, things we should be doing, politics, movies, music, literature, books, science, recent events, history and so on. Topics we discuss or debate on often change, and our conversation shifts its direction from time to time. When we do not talk or gossip, we play computer games or do cycling together. We often visit different places together and love to explore different places. Recently, we went to an art museum and enjoyed our time in a new town, far away from our locality. That would be around a month ago and it was a memorable event for all of us.\n \nTo answer the last question, who does not enjoy spending time with friends? In fact, some people become our dear friends because we like to spend time with them. Good friends remain close to our heart and they have a special place in our life. My friends are very important to me and I feel completely free around them. With them, I do not need to pretend and I can be completely myself. This is probably true for everyone who has good friends."

So, thank you for offering me the opportunity to share a story of such a gratifying act.\n\nI have always loved visiting my favourite restaurants in my home town every once in a while during the weekends in order to enjoy some of my favourite foods. So, the other day, about a several months ago, when I was waiting for my foods at one of my favourite restaurants, I suddenly saw one of my college friends with his newly-married wife approaching my table with a very happy and smiley face. They said that they came to visit me, but since they didn’t find me at home, they were looking for me in the neighbourhood, knowing that I would be somewhere around. I gave my friend a big hug and told him to sit at my table. I also invited the happy couple to enjoy some lamb stew, mixed with mushroom, and long-grain rice on the side, which I already ordered earlier, with me while also ordering for some more foods of their choices. They gladly accepted my proposal and enjoyed my favourite meal with me. My friend had a bubbly character, and so had been his young wife. We talked about a lot of random issues including his new job and their married life. He also requested my favour in helping him find and buy an old but good car in the near future.\n\nIn conclusion, it felt really great and fulfilling to be able to talk to one of my favourite friends from my college and enjoy a great evening over some great meals. In fact, the treat was long overdue since I didn’t invite my friend and his better half to our house because of my busy schedule. Besides, I was alone at the restaurant on that day (because my friends were really preoccupied with other tasks on that weekend), so I certainly appreciated the company of my friend and his wife."

We study engineering at a local college in Mumbai and we share a strong bond among us. I had to share the meal as it was a surprise visit by them in the middle of the night and I thought they deserved a treat.  \n \nThough it was my birthday, the topic of discussion changed after a while. We started discussing the upcoming semester final exam. We also planned how we should plan for our exam preparation. Joseph had fallen in love with a girl of the same college and the issue was discussed and we suggested Joseph some particular measures to continue their affair.\n \nHonestly, it was a delightful experience. My mom cooked Biriyani for us in the middle of the night and we all shared the late-night meal. My friends appreciated my mom’s initiative and praised her cooking so much. In fact, they had a plan just to wish me and leave the house but I did not allow them. Since they were my best buddies, I wanted to treat them. I felt lucky indeed and was grateful to them for taking the trouble to visit a far distance only to wish me a happy birthday."

    "Answer": "Friends are special because we can share absolutely anything with them - be it a whimsical idea, a happy or a sad moment or even a cup of tea. Thank you for the topic and I would like to describe a meal that I shared with two of my best buddies.\n \nIt was almost a year ago and I still remember the event because it was something unusual and special. Jacob brought Della to my house on a Sunday evening and they wanted to take me to a theatre to enjoy a newly released movie. They came to my house all of a sudden and they had no idea that I was suffering from fever. However, they abandoned the whole idea of going out and watching a movie, and instead decided to spend the evening with me. I felt sad that they had to stay at my place despite their plan to enjoy a movie. But they did not want to and thought that I would feel good if they spend the evening with me.\n \nWe talked about so many things and the topics were shifting from silly ones to serious ones quite often. However, a recent football match, some friends from college and Della's recent tour to India were discussed for a long. At one point, Jacob even criticized a political leader's recent action and I totally agreed with him!\n \nAt around 8.00 pm, Della proposed to order a pizza but Jacob thought it would not be a good idea for me as I was ill. He insisted that I should avoid junk food for the time being and eat homemade food. Della then approached the kitchen and prepared a bowl of vegetable soup and a plate of egg pasta. Della did the whole cooking thing and I only helped her find the ingredients in the kitchen cabinet.\n \nI must say, Della's cooking was excellent and the dish was fabulous. The quantity of the meal was not great but we three had an outstanding meal. I, despite a sour taste in my mouth, ate my whole portion!\n \nThis was a great experience and I felt really well that they decided to stay and prepare me a meal to cheer me up. We shared many meals on numerous other occasions, but the friendly gesture and sacrifice they made were exemplary and that's why this was an exceptional meal that I will remember for a long."

    "Answer": "Problems distract us and frustrate us when we expect them in the least just like the problem with my newly-bought computer about a couple of years ago when it started to give me “a hard time”. However, it didn’t become much of an issue as one of my friends offered me a very ‘clever’ solution to deal with the issue.\n\nAnyway, after buying my computer a couple of years ago, it started to give me different kinds of problems soon after starting to use it. Since the computer was not under any warranty, I couldn’t return it or receive any technical support from its vendor or manufacturer. So, all I could do was to take it to a local computer technician every time it gave me a problem. But, after visiting the technician 4/5 times already within just a couple of months, I became a bit frustrated, so I decided to seek a solution from one of my friends. As soon as my friend, whose name was John, learned about my problem, he suggested me to buy a good book on “computer repair and maintenance” and start reading it word by word while using my computer also at the same time like a “kid”. Of course, I was a bit nervous about the “solution” initially as I was a novice in the world of computers and troubleshooting, but my friend assured me that the suggested solution would work just fine for me if I could exercise patience in reading the book.\n\nAnd, guess what, it was indeed a clever solution as I could slowly and slowly begin to figure out many of the computer glitches by myself. In fact, some of the computer problems, for which I took my computer to a technician earlier, could be solved by me after trying with a little patience. Besides, after reading that book, I also came to learn as to how to best handle a computer and keep it safe. But, the best part of the solution was that I could actually boast about my computer repairing abilities to my friends as I could solve “complex” computer glitches rather easily and quickly afterwards."

    "Answer": "It may sound peculiar to many but I have got a clever solution from one of my friends to find more time for reading books and the process is unorthodox. In fact, I love to read books and want to finish at least four to five books in a month but my hectic schedule hardly allows me to finish two books every month. So, do not be surprised by the solution that one of my friends suggested and thank you for the time you have allowed me to talk about it.\n \nLast year, I was wondering how to install a small bookshelf inside the toilet to keep some books safely because the privy attached to my bedroom was unable to accommodate a moderate bookshelf. So, installing a small shelf centring the tissue holder was an unconventional yet smart idea. I used some small wood pieces to form the shape of a bookshelf with the help of my friend and was really proud to have finally made it. Now I can place two or three books together at a time and read them inside the privy.\n \nBarbara suggested the solution to me. In fact, I shared my dilemma with her a few months ago and she suggested me to install a small shelf made with a couple of timber. She also helped me build the shelf. In fact, it was easier than I thought and the credit goes to Barbara who, in fact, gave me a great suggestion.\n \nThe solution to the problem was unusual yet very effective. Now I am using the shelf comfortably and can manage more time for reading books I like. So, considering all the facts, this is a clever solution to my problem of reading books inside the lavatory."

    "Answer": "Thank you sir/madam for the opportunity to let me talk about an event when someone's intelligent suggestion solved a big problem. It was almost two years ago and I wanted to get a part-time job so that I could gain some work experience and in parallel earn some money. But managing a suitable job was not easy especially at a time when most of the companies in our town were downsizing their employees.\n \nTo tell you the truth, I forwarded my CV to a good number of companies and strangely got no interview call. Then I met a friend from my school and during our conversation, he suggested that I should try some freelance work from one or two reputed websites like freelancer.com. At first, I was not convinced but he went on explaining how this could help me enhance my web designing skills and earn a steady amount from my work. He explained to me how he had been able to manage some work and clients from such platforms. I was convinced and thought that it was a step worth taking.\n \nI now feel that my friend James, who actually suggested the solution, did a remarkable job by persuading me to follow his trait. His suggestion to work as a freelancer solved my dilemma to get a job and gain some experience.\n \nDuring the last two years, I have finished some great projects and that would add some weight to my resume. Besides, due to James's timely solution - which was actually an alternative for getting a part-time job, I now enjoy a certain degree of economic freedom and can concentrate more on my studies. I would say that was a great solution from one of my old friends."

    "Answer": "Technology has taken a huge leap forward in the last couple of decades so much so that we are actually struggling to keep up. Today, I would like to talk about one such amazing modern technology which is called a Tablet PC or just Tablet.\n\nWhen I saw this particular “technological wonder” for the first time, which neither was a shrunken laptop nor an oversized smartphone, about 3 years ago, I immediately knew that I got to have one, and eventually I got one, which I have now for almost 2 years. Anyway, I use my favourite and unique hand-held device to do pretty much everything from sending and receiving emails, finding important information, preparing and editing documents, watching movies and videos, listening to my favourite music and enjoying just browsing through during my leisure time. I also use it to capture images of different kinds of things and doing video-conferencing with my families, friends, relatives and co-workers. In fact, it looks like I can never have enough of my wonderful gadget whatever I am doing or wherever I am going.\n\nThis electronic device is really important to me mainly because it allows me to take care of many of my office tasks at home at my convenience as my job is really demanding. Besides, it saves me a lot of time by helping to find important information during emergency time and situations. Then there are times when I also need to send a lot of data and information quickly either to my friends or fellow office workers immediately, and that’s when my tablet PC comes to my rescue. On top of that, I can carry this device very easily with me whenever I need it. Finally, this device is important to me because it allows me to work on the go and thus helping me save a lot of time."

    "Answer": "Canon 6D Mark II is a piece of modern technology in the arena of photography. This is one of the latest cameras in the market from the reputed camera manufacturer - Canon. It is an impressive piece of technology to capture both the pictures and videos. The 26.2-megapixel camera was released in July this year. I am very satisfied to own this piece of contemporary technology and it is quite handy for me. I would like to thank you for this great topic.\n \nTo tell you the truth, I am an amateur photographer and in fact, I am learning photography for the past two years. So, I needed a quality camera for my practical class and to take photos to enhance my skills in photography. Earlier, I used my mobile phone to capture some photos but there were some resolutions issues. Hence, I decided to get a branded camera recommended by my teacher. Accordingly, I got this wonderful piece.\n \nTo be precise, I have been using the camera from January of this year. In fact, I had to wait a few days for the camera to reach my country, Nepal. I ordered the camera from an online store and it took nearly a week for them to deliver the package to my doorstep. It has become a constant companion for me since the day I got it.\n \nThis camera is important to me for its extraordinary image taking capability. The full-frame sensor of the camera is outstanding and the DIGIC 7 image processor works beyond expectation. I am glad about the crystal clear images and high resolution that makes the captured picture quite vivid. Besides, the swivel and tilt touchscreen of the camera has brought a revolution in the photography industry. I am in love with the 6D II for its full-frame. The viewfinder enhancement has changed my experience indeed. Due to all the reasons, the camera is of great importance to me."

    "Answer": "They say dependency on technology is a bad thing and that makes me wonder how could I ever manage to go on without the smartphone I have! I would like to thank you for this nice topic and would talk about the smartphone I proudly own and use.\n \nTo give the details of this piece of technology - this is a smartphone by Samsung and the model is Galaxy S9. I do not own this particular model for a long as it was recently released but if I consider the time duration for which I have owned a smartphone, that would be really long, perhaps six to seven years at least.\n \nWhat I use it for? Well - I use it for an array of reasons. The first and most obvious reason is to be able to talk to others and get in touch with the people I care about. The second most apparent reason is to get connected to the Internet where I can check and send emails, use social networking websites and applications, chat with friends and family, share my pictures, listen to music and browse different websites. But the utilisation of this handheld device is really large. I would try to give you some examples which would depict how widely this device is used. Well, it has a built-in alarm clock that I use daily to wake up on time, I capture stunning pictures in bright daylight and super low light with this camera, I listen to my favourite music or watch a YouTube video on it. I even hail a taxi using the application installed in it and pay my bills using the online wallet I have. For all these reasons this has become more than a phone to me.\n \nI guess something becomes essential when it serves important purposes for us. The smartphone is irreplaceable for me, and for many others who use it daily for sending emails, hiring a taxi or paying bills - to mention a few utilisations it offers. The range goes on and the smartphone is more than a phone now, it is a serious device for many serious purposes in our life."

    "Answer": "I had always wanted to buy a motorbike in the past, but I couldn’t really progress with the idea mainly because I just didn’t manage to save enough money for the purpose. But, one day, the situation changed, and I decide to buy my dream bike.\n\nI searched a lot of markets and motorbike stores to choose my dream motorbike, but the problem was there were just so many different models with so many different features and options that I was really struggling to decide whether I wanted to buy a sports bike, a standard motorbike, a cruiser or a naked motorbike.\n\nAnyway, after spending many hours at different motorbike stores, I did finally find what met my requirements. I even liked the price. So, I just told the store owner that I would come back the next afternoon in order to pick the bike as it was on discount. So far so good! But, when I did go back the next day with enough cash to pay for the motorbike, I found out that there was no discount on the bike anymore, and as a result, I needed to pay a significantly-extra amount of money which I just didn’t have with me at that moment. However, after that, I suggested the store manager if I could pay them some money in advance and bring rest of the money after a week in order to buy the bike, I really liked, but ot my astonishment, the store manager disagreed and told me that his hands were tied!\n\nWell, anyway, I felt really disappointed, to say the least, with what happened to me at the motorbike store mainly because it was a bit embarrassing for me. I also felt a bit annoyed at the store manager as he never told me about the possible price change should I had failed to buy the bike on the same day. Besides, I also got very frustrated as I travelled a significant distance and spent a lot of time to travel to the store, of course, only to find out that I couldn’t buy my bike on that day."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this nice cue card topic. I would like to share my experience when I wanted to purchase a mobile phone so badly but could not pay for it. Since my younger sister had been saving money to get a smartphone and had been far away to manage the total budget, I wanted to buy her the phone. She had been saving money for at least three months by adjusting her regular expenses as she wanted to change her feature phone and own a smartphone. So, I planned to pay for the smartphone and surprise her.\n \nUnluckily, I was unable to pay for the phone. I lost my wallet on the way to the shopping mall from where I intended to purchase the mobile phone. This unfortunate event happened in July 2018. I had no idea how did I lose my wallet with money in it! I might have dropped it in the taxi I took to reach the shopping mall. So, I could not buy a mobile phone right then.\n \nI informed the matter to my mom and then called the bank authorities to report a lost debit card which was placed inside the wallet. It was a disaster for me.\n \nI felt terrible. In fact, it could have been one of the happiest moments of my life. It was meant to the very first gift for my younger sister after I got my first job. But the luck was not kind to me that day! I explained everything to my dad and he agreed to pay me a loan with which I finally purchased a Samsung smartphone for my sister. I eventually could solace my heart as my sister was exhilarated as soon as she unwrapped the box."

    "Answer": "Well, thank you for an intriguing topic. It reminds me of a cynical yet interesting day when I felt quite embarrassed about my inability to buy my younger sister a trendy dress she wished to have.\n \nWhile doing some holiday shopping, my sister pointed out a dress in the vast Neoclassical building on Oxford Street in the Selfridges shopping complex. They house some of the most expensive brands in the UK and they virtually invented window shopping. It's a great store at which big names such as  Mulberry, Vivienne Westwood, Barbour, Burberry, Paul Smith, Aquascutum and many more are housed. They allow customers to interact unhindered with the items from the sale.\n \nThe particular attire she craved for was a women's crepe dress with a concealed zip fastening at back and it was a blue attire made in Japan. However, it was something I could not pay for as it was more than twelve hundred pounds while I had only seven hundred something in total in my wallet!\n \nMy sister really liked the dress but totally disagreed with the price tag. She immediately looked at me and laughed knowing that it was way more expensive than we can afford. We pretended to stroll for a while and left the shopping mall. Once outside, I assured her that I would buy her such designer dresses someday when I will have a full-time job. She was not sad at all, or at least that's what I thought, but I was, and it gave me a melancholic feeling. The dress was highly expensive but you know how a teenage girl would feel not having it when many of her friends could afford them!  That day, which would be by now 3 years ago, I was determined to buy my little sister even better dresses than that one. I did so on many occasions but I can never forget that particular day."

    "Answer": "I have never really been in favour of buying expensive clothing primarily because they tend to look worn out and old rather quickly most of the times, no matter how expensive they really are. But the other day, about a couple of month ago, I did buy an expensive winter coat because my grandfather offered me the money as “gift” and wanted me to buy something really “classy”.\n\nUntil these recent years, winter in my country wasn’t really very cold, and so I didn’t really need to buy any heavy winter clothes. But, lately, winters are becoming rather cold. On top of that, I also found out that most of my winter clothes were either worn out or looked rather “faded” for wearing. So, when the offer to buy a good winter cloth came, I took up on the offer and decided to buy an expensive winter coat. \n\nThe coat cost me an equivalent of almost US $300 which was quite expensive by the standard of my country. Anyway, the coat was really nice and fitted me really well. It was made of pure and top quality leather, and it was water-proofed. The waist-length winter coat was also of a nice and mild brown colour. However, I think that the best feature of that winter coat was that it was not really heavy even though it was made of pure leather.\n\nAfter buying that winter coat, initially, I felt that I shouldn’t have spent so much money on buying that coat because up until that point I had never really bought such an expensive cloth. But, later on, I convinced myself that the money was well-spent primarily because it was indeed a good product and that I would be able to wear the coat for a long period of time. Besides, it indeed made me feel really comfortable as I wasn’t exactly struggling to cope with the harsh winter anymore. Finally, I thanked my grandfather for buying me such “classy” winter coat as it looked really good on me."

    "Answer": "I have recently bought a trench coat known as Maison Margiela form a branded shop in Berlin, Germany. This is a gorgeous coat and comes in the latest fashion and style. The coat has some special features and fastening capacities. I would like to thank you for this nice cue card topic and would further describe why I have purchased it, how much it has cost me and my feelings regarding my purchase of this coat.\n \nI bought the coat from Harvey Nichols – a renowned clothing brand across the country. It took 1000 euros – a bit expensive for a student like me but I could not resist owning the coat because of its amazing look and feel. I have planned that I would adjust a few other costs a couple of months from now on to cover the extra expense.\n \nI bought the trench coat considering the comfort it offers and the cold weather during the winter. It is fashionable and the special cuts on the coat body are very attractive. The coat comes with stone cut double-breasted buttons on the front side. The belt that I use to fasten it is detachable. The fabric is made of pure cotton and it comes with the dry cleaning facility.\n \nAfter purchasing the coat, I had a mixture of feelings. First of all, I felt a deep sense of satisfaction to have the coat. But when I considered the price, it appeared that I spent exorbitantly. I have spent almost all the pocket money on the coat. However, I am happy to have a dazzling trench coat like this one."

    "Answer": "Although my wardrobe is full of trendy and upscale clothes, I could not restrain myself from buying a really expensive dress by Burberry- which is one of the most expensive clothing brands in the world. I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about it.\n \nThe dress I have bought is a Tiered Jersey which is a type of fluid jersey T-shirt dress with a tiered skirt and crystal-embellished brooch. It had two colours- black and blue and I purchased the black one. It is not casual wear and I have planned to wear it on special occasions like a birthday party. I purchased it from an outlet in London a few months ago and it cost me exactly one thousand and eight hundred pounds!\n \nFrankly speaking, it won’t be an exaggeration to call myself a cloth horse. Whenever I see a trendy dress or feel like I should buy a particular piece of clothing, I feel an urge to have it. On this particular occasion, I was visiting a friend in London and strolled on the street for a while with her. The dress caught my eyes and I entered the showroom of Burberry. I ended up paying a large sum of money for this dress. I bought it because I liked it and this is often the case with people who have a great zeal for shopping - specifically for dresses.\n \nHow did I feel? Well-  Firstly, I regretted on buying such an expensive branded clothes, but after a few minutes, the attraction to having such a dress for the first time evaporated my concern. If I tell you right now how I feel, I would say I am trying to be more rational - you know what I mean."

    "Answer": "A few months ago I took part in a photography competition organized by a local museum and won the second title. I consider it a fabulous achievement and I am genuinely proud of this accomplishment. When I saw my photo in a daily newspaper as one of the winners, I was very exhilarated. Many of my relatives and friends congratulated me for the achievement and I am fortunate to have the chance to talk about it. I must thank you for that.\n\nI am not a professional shutterbug. I finished a basic course in photography two years ago. I still consider myself a learner, and this achievement is highly encouraging for me to go further. There were more than seven hundred contestants and being second in the final stage was not easy. The competition was announced in a local newspaper with the rules and policies to submit both digital and printed versions of the photos and I selected three best shots of mine and submitted those to the organizers.\n\nThe photograph that won me the second prize depicted an old woman anxiously waiting at the station for someone to arrive. It perfectly blended her red dress and yellow hat with the station’s red and white colour. A glimpse of the approaching train was visible at a far distant. I took this snapshot in 2015 and had long revered it as one of my best works as an amateur photographer.\n\nThe second prize brought me 700 dollars and a silver crest along with a certificate. The prize money was not significant, but from an inspirational point of view, this was priceless. It definitely boosted my motivation to continue my work, which I was often confused about and made me renowned to the contemporary aspiring photographers. I have every valid reason to be proud of this achievement, I guess."

I would like to thank you for this nice cue card topic and the time you have allowed me to talk about one of my feats that I feel very proud of.\n\nI can't be sure how it started but in the third semester of my university, I found myself smoking cigarettes and without even noticing, this became a habit I could not leave behind. Initially, it was just curiosity and fun, but not after a few months when I was already a regular smoker. However, last year I finally stopped smoking as it was my only new year resolution and I feel great about it. To be more precise, I quit smoking on the 31st night in 2018.\n\nI have tried to quit smoking several times in the past 3 years and it was not easy. It was both a physical and psychological challenge to which I yielded and finally started this heinous habit again. But it was not the case on the 31st night in 2018. My determination helped me overcome this and achieve something I have failed several other times in my life.\n\nSmoking is a silent killer and a habit that no one should be in. The first time I tried to quit smoking was the time I realized how difficult it was. It was like iterating in a circle that does not close! The urge to puff a few more times never ended and I was feeling the lack of stamina when playing football or table tennis. I was quite determined, however, to get back to the stage when smoking was not a part of my life. Luckily I am without it for the last few months. This is, in fact, is one of the biggest achievements of my life."

But, that’s exactly what happened to me a few years ago, and I needed to get back in “shape” again by hook or by crook.\n\nSo, I started to put a break on my eating habit by giving up on carbohydrate and meats- especially the “red meats” like beef and mutton. I controlled my diet like this for some times, but nothing really changed as far my body weight was concerned. To be honest, it wasn’t really easy to remain “starved” of the “good and tasty food” which I loved eating for such a long time previously. Anyway, seeing no reduction in body weight, I decided to walk for at least two hours every day. But, maintaining that routine walk wasn’t very easy either because I was short on time due to my rather busy work schedule. But, I promised to myself that I needed to lose my weight significantly in the next six months no matter how difficult it really was. To achieve my goal of “losing weight”, I even started to eat some fruits, which I had always avoided eating, in order bring some much-needed energy in me to carry on with the routine walk. Finally, after some tiring efforts of about 4 months, I started noticing that I was close to achieving my goal of losing weight.\n\nAnyway, I feel really proud of this achievement mainly because many of my friends and relatives had told me that I wouldn’t be able to lose my weight because I loved eating too much, and I was too lazy to do any physical work out for a long period of time. I feel proud of this achievement also because even though I really struggled to maintain my routine walk and food habit for almost six months, I managed to do everything on time and enjoy my life without much trouble which was even surprising for a lazy guy like myself!"

But, I got a first-hand experience of how rewarding or challenging it really was only after I was forced to embark on a mission of formally teaching my little niece.\n\nIt was about 5 years ago, and I just started my new job as a Jr. Software Engineer at a small software firm in my country. Of course, I was lucky that my job had given me a nice, personal laptop so that I could work on it at home from time to time except, of course, the problem was my little 8 years old niece (whom I loved so much, by the way) also liked that laptop, and she also wanted to learn to work on a computer. I tried to dissuade her from using my laptop mainly because I never thought of myself as a “good teacher”. But, she was just too stubborn, and I was left with no other choices than teaching her.\n\nSo, the computer lesson began, and to my pleasant surprise, I found out that my niece was rather smart in learning basic things like turning on and off a computer, opening a particular software and composing documents. She even learned things like rearranging application windows, drawing pictures, playing games after teaching her only about a few times. I also taught her how to protect folders, do some basic maths, send emails and search for anything on the internet apart from giving her some ideas on what a computer is really capable of accomplishing.\n\nAnyway, I felt really good and a bit proud of myself also as I managed to teach my little niece about some complex (supposed to be complex for a child, I thought) computer lessons without much efforts and hassle. In fact, up until those computer lessons, I never thought that I could teach someone with such ease. Besides, it was after these computer lessons that I realized that we should never underestimate the abilities of children which I did previously."

    "Answer": "I now realise how difficult it is to be a good teacher who is equally successful in teaching pupils and being their idol. For that dilemma, I always wanted to be in any profession except for teaching. However, life is full of surprises and when I was a sophomore at my university, I had to agree to teach one of my younger cousins, John, for his university admission. I was terrified of the proposal while John was convinced he would be better prepared with my help. I would like to thank you for the time to let me share my experience of teaching my cousin.\n\nI have completed my university degree and my major was civil engineering. I studied at a prestigious university where most of the science students want to pursue their higher education. After John completed his 12th grades, he wanted to get admitted to this very university and thought that I would be a great help. It was 2017 and I was in my third term then. The entrance exam is quite competitive and more than 60 students contest for a single seat. John’s parents first approached me so that I help their son with his admission test preparation but I humbly declined their request. However, when my cousin himself talked to me and expressed his inner-belief how I could make his dream come true, I could not say no to him.\n\nFor the next three months or so, I helped him with math, physics and chemistry. I would say, teaching John was a magnificent experience and this changed my perspective towards the teaching profession. He was a talented and attentive learner and his success in the admission test gave me a sense of fulfilment."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this great topic. Rather than telling you about a ‘typical’ home I know, I want to share with you the story of possibly the most amazing house I’ve ever been lucky enough to visit.\n\nSo, the story was, I was travelling in Australia. An elderly relative of mine, now living in the UK, had spent many years working there and was really keen I look up an old friend of hers who lived ‘in the rainforest’ in a quite remote part of Queensland, near a coastal village called Cardwell.\n\nAfter a few months or so, I arrived at her ‘house’. Oh! my. I have never seen anything like it before or since! Imagine a little wooden house, raised up on stilts, with a veranda completely encircling the structure, a rather crude slatted wooden roof and wooden interior walls. Imagine all of this, but with no external walls! It was as if the property had just grown organically from the forest floor.\n\nThe weather was warm year round in this part of the world, and clearly, my host felt very safe in the forest. Rather than have a barrier between her and the forest, she chose to have no exterior walls, her living space merged with the plants and animals that surrounded her. I think there may have been a low wooden fence at the back of the property, but really this was mainly to stop things falling off her platform, rather than give privacy or security!\n\nWhat did I like! Well, the feeling of being a part of the rainforest was the most amazing part. It was an unobtrusive dwelling, probably we would call it ‘eco-friendly’ in the language of today. She told me that sometimes she’d be having an early breakfast on her porch and see cassowaries wander past. They are incredibly shy and rare so that is a remarkable thing. I loved the quirkiness of the house, the minimalism of her furnishings. You really don’t need very much in the way of material things to have a good life. Also, I suppose there’s a very little point in having lots of possessions when the rainforest might encroach on you at any moment. The house is a physical reminder of a memory that otherwise seems almost too extraordinary to be true!"

    "Answer": "Living in a poor neighbourhood has its disadvantages, but it has some advantages as well. For example, when you visit rich neighbourhood houses, you look at them rather closely and appreciate their elegant and beautiful features just like I did when I visited one of my friend’s houses to attend his birthday party about a few years ago.\n\nThe magnificent “row house” (a row of attached dwellings share side walls) was conveniently located at one of the beautiful suburbs of my home town which was only about 15-minute drive away from my rather “modest” looking home.\n\nAs soon as I entered the house, I could see a small but finicky garden, flaunting right at the entrance in order to impress me. After entering the house, I could also see an elegant formal living room, with which is attached a rather stylish and “chic” family dining space. Adjacent to the “munching” area is a healthy kitchen which is really fashionable with enough empty space in it. The house has three graceful and fancy bedrooms with the master bath on one side and the other two bedrooms on the opposite side of the house, with just about perfect proximity to each other. There are translucent curtains, running throughout the entire house, which is painted in a light champagne tint, bringing in the required brightness and airiness in perfect measure.  \n\nAnyway, the house was really beautiful mainly because it was neither too big nor too small where all of its furniture seemed to have fitted just perfectly. Another distinct but equally elegant feature of the house was that it could receive enough air from virtually all directions. Besides, I also noticed that the entire lighting system of the house was very much in harmony with the paintings of the house interior. Finally, I thought that it was a really beautiful house also because it was surrounded by beautiful nature with some beautiful trees and the chirping of the birds on them which I could enjoy by sitting in one of the balconies of the house anytime."

    "Answer": "Initially, I wasn’t very happy when my whole family moved to Hanoi City about a decade ago from Ho Chi Min city even though they told me the capital of Vietnam was a better city from the city of Ho Chi Min in every aspect. But, I had to agree with them at least for once when I started to study at one of the high schools in Hanoi.\n\nThe high school, I attended, was a state-of-the-art institution and a \"purpose-built\" school which featured first-class facilities in order to support each and every one of its students. The school had specialist teaching facilities for science, art, drama, music and ICT on its huge 10-acre campus. The campus is consisted of 4 large, 3-storey buildings, adjacent to each other, with a huge empty space around them. The campus hosted an extensive library, auditorium, a theatre, indoor 25-meter swimming pool, a fully equipped indoor sports hall and additional outdoor playing surfaces for the students. The campus buildings were modern in its every sense with lovely champagne colour paintings both on its inside as well as the outside. I was lucky to have studied for three years at my favourite high school until I started my higher education.\n\nI liked pretty much each and everything about my high school in Hanoi, but the best aspect, which really set it apart from other schools, was that it probably had around 100 trees of different kinds of flowers inside its campus. Another thing, which I really liked about my school, was its huge swimming pool in which I used to swim at the end of my classes almost every day during the hot summer. Finally, the campus and its buildings were designed in such unique way that one could actually view the campus and its beautiful flower trees even from a mile away as if the buildings were really close to its distant viewers."

    "Answer": "Saint Partick High School is one of the largest institutions in the Kingsly area and this is perhaps the best school in the entire town. I spent almost six years there and have had some wonderful memories. I would like to thank you for this excellent cue card topic.\n \nLocated at the South-east corner on the city map, Saint Patrick High School offers young students quality education and one of the best views in town from its premises. It was established almost one hundred years ago in an area which is more than 30 acres. The then-mayor, Mr Abel, finished establishing the metro rail system a few years earlier and that had made the communication to and from the school very convenient. This school always make endeavours to excel at all courses that are offered to students. It is one of the prominent and autonomous schools in our state with excellent academic results.\n \nI got admitted to this school when I was around twelve years old. I studied there until I finished my high school diploma and will never forget my time there. I must admit I enjoyed my high school days thoroughly and thanks to the great masters who worked really hard for us.\n \nThe school is really big and the buildings are mostly two-storied and large enough. During my time, we had around three thousand students. The spectacular gardens and immaculately maintained yards, traditionally structured red and white buildings and large open space make it look more like a museum than a school.\n \nI loved so many things in my school. I relished the rich collection of books the school library had, the large and green playground where I used to play every evening, the scenic beauty of it and so on. But the most attractive aspect of the school was the excellent teachers who used to teach us. The institution could not have been the best one without the dedication and hard work they have put in. I still remember how our teachers had been our mentor, leader and coach on the one hand, and yet friendly on the other hand. During my six years studentship in that alma mater, I have learned a lot and the credit goes to the teachers who had been so inspiring for us."

    "Answer": "We owe a lot to some people around us because it is them, who help us, one way or another, to become the persons we are today. But, we can probably single out our “teachers” among them to be the “most important”. Today, I would like to talk about one such teacher – my English teacher that is – who influenced me significantly to do better in my life.\n\nHis name was Mr Hang Sen, and he used to teach me English at my college. I came to know about him for the first time when I wanted to enrol for an “English Composition” class, but unfortunately the class was full, and my request for enrolment was denied (because there usually is a high number of college applicants in China but rather limited number of seats) until, of course, I could manage a “special permission from Mr Hang. So, I rushed to him and asked for his permission. However, he wasn’t very happy to see me but allowed me in his class, nonetheless.\n\nAnyway, from the very first day in his class, Mr Hang made it absolutely clear that he meant only “business” and that he was going to make English really “easy” for us. In fact, Mr Hang sometimes used to ask each of his students separately if they understood his lecture. He even used to ask us about how many hours of our study schedules were exactly spent in learning English every day in order to make sure that we were indeed serious about learning English.\n\nMr Hang really inspired me to do better in life as he was never really ready to give up on me (I was really “bad” in English), or any other of his students, until I succeeded. In fact, it was because of his relentless efforts that I have learned to express my thoughts in English today. Finally, it was Mr Hang who taught me to never give up on my dreams no matter how many times I failed, and how difficult were the circumstances around me."

    "Answer": "A father is a hero to his children and the sacrifices he makes to bring smiles to his family are incomparable. My father had always been my inspiration, and he still is. He is my greatest mentor also. The way he influenced and motivated me in different stages in my life to become a good human being, to fight against the odds in life, to attain the success and most importantly to be happy in life are exemplary. I want to be a father to my children the way he had been to me.\n\nI know him from the very first day of my life. In fact, I bear the genetic codes he has. The way I was attached to my father in my childhood shaped my psychological development. I still feel a strong bond between us - more like the way I felt as a helpless child.\n\nHe is a university professor and teaches physics to his students. He is a much-revered master to his pupils. He loves to read books, visit historical places and experience new cuisines. He often goes out for fishing and has a tough-luck while catching fishes! Besides, he likes classic movies and we often watch movies together. 'It's a Wonderful Life', a Hollywood classic is his favourite movie. Umm, to say more about him... he hates when people break their commitments and when his students cheat on an exam. People who know him in person say that he is a humble and honest man who has been helpful to others all his life.\n\nHe had been there when I needed him and he still is my greatest shield. He encouraged me to try over and over again. I always thought that failure is a shame and the end, but he pointed out that our failures are our greatest lessons in life. He taught me to study out of interests, not only to score in the exams. I still learn from him. He has invisibly shaped my character and I am greatly influenced by him to attain excellence."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this interesting topic. I, in fact, can recall several such occasions and for this cue card topic, I would like to talk about one of my recent exciting experiences.\n\nA couple of months ago I went to watch a 3D animated movie in a movie theatre for the first time in my life. I have had experience of watching a 3D movie at home but not in a really large screen in a theatre. It was an overwhelming experience and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nTo be more precise, I went to watch the movie with two close friends of mine and it was mid-February in 2018. The name of the movie theatre was (...say a movie theatre name...) and the movie we enjoyed was (...say an animated movie name...). Once there, I decided to watch a 3D movie as I thought it would be fun to watch a 3D movie on a large screen. To share my impression with you, I was enthralled and quite taken aback with the surreal stage at which I entered when I wore the 3D glasses. It was as if I was present at the scene and was witnessing the whole thing with my own eyes!\n\nJust after I put on the glasses that were designed for watching 3D movies, I was taken to a magical yet original world of animation. I can not compare it with my previous experience of watching a movie in a theatre. I felt as if I was cut off from reality and transported to a fairy world of animated characters. The sound system of the theatre added another thrilling dimension to the experience. Though 3D movies are still in its primary stages, I would say, it has advanced remarkably and offers a whole new dimension to the movie lovers.\n\nThe experience I have had at that time was unique. I was so enchanted with the experience that I went to watch another 3D movie within a week. Afterwards, I have enjoyed more than five or six 3D movies so far but the excitement of experiencing it for the first time is unforgettable."

    "Answer": "Life is full of many exciting experiences, some of which, we tend to forget, but as for others, we remember them for a long time. Today, I would like to talk about such an experience, involving riding on a boat, which I will never forget.\n\nIt was during a long summer holiday about 5 years ago, when my university had just closed, and I decided to visit one of my best friend’s home town at his invitation in order to see one of the biggest lakes of my country. The lake was very famous, not only because of its huge size but also because of its crystal clear water. Anyway, I was very excited about my visit to see the lake, but little did I know that even more excitement and surprise were waiting for me.\n\nIn fact, after arriving at my friend’s hometown, when he took me to the lake, I could see a brand new, white, and motor-driven boat was waiting for us to ride. However, the problem was I never had a boat journey before, nor did I know any swimming. But my friend was indeed brave, and he assured me that nothing would happen. So, our boat journey started and in no time, I found myself far away from the lakeshore. The exciting thing was that I could actually see the fishes swimming around us through the clear water of the lake! In a second, I forgot about my fear and wanted to catch some of those big fishes, but my friend prevented me.\n\nAnyway, it was indeed a “once in a lifetime” kind of exciting experience for me because I never travelled by boat before. Besides, when I was in the middle of the lake, it felt like the sky was only covering the lake like a “tower”.  I also felt like the fishes wanted to talk to us and befriend with us when they were swimming around our boat! Finally, chirping of the birds over our heads felt like they were singing to “greet” us in their world!"

Being the father for the first time in my life is something I will always cherish and this was an event that is incomparable to any other event of my life.\n\nI became a father two years ago and the birth of my daughter was truly a blessing for me. It was so exciting and exhilarating experience that I  can never forget it.\n\nMy daughter Angella, who is a beautiful angel to me, is two years and a few days old. So this event took place around two years ago. To be exact, it happened on 4th January 2017 and she was born in a hospital called Square Maternity Care & Baby Hospital in the UK.\n\nMy wife and I were expecting our first baby, and on 12th January 2017, we visited the hospital to consult with a doctor. She suggested that we should be prepared to get my wife admitted to the hospital on that very day as the baby is due in a couple of days. According to her suggestion, I took my wife to the hospital in the evening to get her admitted there and my parents and sister accompanied us. Two days later, at around 11.30 in the morning, we were blessed with a baby daughter.\n\nThe first time I heard that my wife gave birth to a healthy and beautiful baby girl and both of them were doing great, I was probably the happiest person in the whole universe. I felt an inexpressible joy and could not wait to see them both. When I hold my daughter, who was the most gorgeous thing I have ever seen, the time literally froze! I gazed upon her for a few minutes and overwhelming joy and utter excitement took control of me. The baby was crying, probably because I hold her while she wanted to be wrapped in her mother's lap, and I was smiling. This is the first time I realised what it really means to become a father. The experience will linger in my mind till my last day on this earth and the happiness and excitement it brought is indescribable."

    "Answer": "I never considered myself to be a “meritorious” student like many others, so I have to study really hard and for a long time if I want to achieve good grades on my tests. But the problem is, no matter how hard I try, I really struggle to concentrate on my study even on my best days sometimes.\n\nLuckily, however, I have figured out a way to bring back my concentration by going to a local café and spending some times there while enjoying some fresh coffee and reading some travel magazines. By the way, since the café is not really that far away from my home, I don’t use any transportation and instead, just take a walk while enjoying nature and fresh air. The good thing about visiting a café is that it allows me to listen to some really interesting conversations of the coffee lovers. Sometimes, I also take part in those conversations when they talk about such subjects with which I am familiar as well. Besides, when reading a travel magazine, I almost always come to know about some interesting places about which I try to share with other people at the coffee shop if they show any interest. By the way, I do this particular activity because it makes me feel like I am visiting a new place, full of many new and interesting people, who share the same kind of interests with me.\n\nThis activity helps me to concentrate back on my study again mainly because it allows me to refresh myself and unclog my mind from the difficult (and sometimes, boring) subjects of my study. Besides, the activity hits me with sense a “guilty feeling” as I had “wasted” a lot of time at the café, instead of spending it on my studies, which, in turn, forces me to concentrate hard. Finally, since I really enjoy this particular activity a lot, I carry that “great feeling” with me when I study which, then, makes my study rather easy for me."

    "Answer": "Thank you for the time you have allowed me to talk about something that I employ to study more effectively and attentively. As a student, I find this method quite helpful.\n \nTo be more precise, I often take a break and listen to a song only to get back to my desk to continue my studies a few minutes later. This method is so far proven to be effective and helps me study for long hours without getting bored or distracted. I believe sometimes listening to our favourite songs refreshes us and gives us inspiration.\n \nWe live in an apartment which is on the 8th floor of the building and my room has a great view. So whenever I take a break to tune in to my favourite songs, I try to leave my desk and sit on a chair placed at the balcony. If I am too busy to go to the balcony, perhaps because of the last hour preparation for an important exam, I try to leave the desk and sit on the sofa. I use my iPod to listen to music. I have more than 300 songs stored on that iPod and I have hand-picked them according to my music taste.\n \nI have been doing it for more than three years and perhaps I have invented this method to find a way to study for long hours. Nowadays, it has become a part of my study techniques and sometimes my motivation to keep studying to achieve an excellent academic result.\n \nThis process or method, whatever I call it, helps me better concentrate on my study because we need breaks to revive our mind and without breaks even interesting tasks become tiresome. Whenever I leave my desk and focus on something else for a while, I get recharged and new energy to study for another half an hour or so. Thus even if I study for more than 12 hours a day, I do not feel the fatigue or tiresomeness of studying for long hours."

    "Answer": "Thank you for this marvellous topic and I would like to express my appreciation for the time you have allowed me to think about it and finally talk about it.\n \nMeditation is the activity I rely on to concentrate on my work. Some might disagree or even discard the idea, but meditation has remarkably enhanced my work performance. Despite my attempt to find a way to better concentrate on my work at the office, I was lagging behind until I started meditating a year ago. Since then, I can work more earnestly and attentively than ever before.  \n \nThis activity does not require a significant amount of time, just 15-20 minutes are more than enough provided that I maintain the consistency of practising it daily. It is very simple to do and I just need to seat relaxed and focus on my breath and concentrate on my inner self. I do it mostly in my room in the morning and sometimes in the office. The beauty of the meditation is that I can do it anywhere, anytime.\n \nHonestly speaking, I have tried several ways of focusing on the important tasks, including listening to music, reading a newspaper, watching news channels for a while, doing exercise and so on. However, meditation has been proved to be an effective way to pay more attention to my work and has also helped me control my anger and silly emotions. Since I try to relax my body and mind during the meditation session, it helps me gain more positive energy to work better.\n \nIn an ever-growing world of Facebook, YouTube or Twitter updates, shiny new blog posts, it is no surprise that our ability to focus and concentrate has taken a nosedive. When we take time to relax by doing a meditation session and focus on the present, it helps to create a stronger control of the mind’s function and productivity. Thus I can pay more concentration on my work and remove distractions."

By the way, I really enjoyed having milk and cereal as my breakfast, but sometimes I had to eat just a plain vegetable sandwich with a glass of milk with it when there was no cereal. After arriving my school, of course, I needed to attend classes and other school activities for a marathon 7 hours that included an hour of lunch break and 30 minutes of physical exercise, which, by the way, I never really liked, although I liked the tiffin, provided by my school, of boiled egg, potato chips and a banana/apple a lot during the lunch hour.\n\nAfter finishing school, I straight returned to my home and had to take some rest, as was the rule, put forth by my mother, before going out to play with my friends. Sometimes, I used to play football with my friends, and I used to serve as their regular goalkeeper, at a playground next to my home. Sometimes, I used to ride my bicycle there also without going too far from my home as my mother would never approve of that. Later in the day, I sometimes used to watch some TV as well with my family.\n\nThe most enjoyable part of my day was walking to school with my friends as I could talk about a lot of things with them and make jokes. Another thing, which I really enjoyed, was buying my favourite ice-creams during the lunch break at my school and sharing them with my friends.

Honestly speaking, my childhood was magical and full of surprises. There was no crisis, anxiety or responsibilities and every moment, I was ready to explore the unknown and do something new and interesting.\n \nI would like to talk about a typical day of my childhood when I was around 7 or 8 years old. I used to wake up very early and get ready for my school. I used to eat my breakfast at around 6.30 in the morning and the milk, bread, banana and egg were the usual breakfast items. My mother prepared breakfast for the whole family. Then I rode with my dad on his motorbike every day to school. I played with my classmates before and after our classes. I mostly played football, chess, hide-and-seek and the merry-go-round with my classmates and friends.  \n \nWhen I returned home at around 2.00 pm, it was the time for taking a shower and no matter how hard I tried to avoid it, my mother always made sure that I took my shower. For lunch, we ate what my mother cooked at home and she was a gorgeous cook who had an uncanny power of cooking delicious meals. Interestingly, I never wanted to take a nap after lunch and play instead, but my mother would not let me.\n \nAs I can recall, my mother mostly looked after me while my father tried to spend quality time with both of us when he was at home. He often helped me complete my homework, or played chess with me. I must be very lucky to have such passionate, caring and friendly parents who always sacrificed their interests to be with my side and to make us happy. I did not have any brother or sister and I always thought kids with a lot of siblings had more fun!\n \nThe afternoon was the most exciting time for me as I could do anything at that time and was not forced to study. I often went outside to play with my friends. We played football, chess and merry-go-round and the type of games we played varied based on the season. Sometimes we ran and shouted for no apparent reason. At night I spend a couple of hours to watch TV and then complete my homework. I usually went to bed at around 10.30 pm.\n \nI would say everything in my childhood was exhilarating. However, the natural beauty around our neighbourhood, my parents, unbound freedom to play and good friends were something truly special and I still miss those days. I wish I could get back to those days and enjoy my time as a child again!"

By the way, there are four different kinds of trains in Portugal, depending on the distance they travel. Anyway, it takes a good 30 minutes to reach my office from my home but it doesn’t feel that long due to the fact that the trains in my country are very comfortable with spacious seats and comfortable temperatures no matter what time of the year you are travelling. And that’s exactly why, I always try to travel by train unless, of course, there is a valid reason to choose other means of transportation.  \n\nI enjoy my train journey from my home to office and vice versa because most of the area between Lisbon and Sintra is really scenic and beautiful as Sintra itself is a beautiful tourist spot. In fact, Portugal is a very beautiful country with beautiful mountainsides, vineyards, olive trees and sparkling sea coast.  Besides, the environment inside the train is remarkably peaceful with no unnecessary noise unlike the sound of AC on a bus. Finally, I absolutely enjoy the train journey because it is never really dependent on weather and as such very reliable. By the way, I rather enjoy the “rhythmic” sound of a moving train as it helps me take a little nap during my journey."

Now I would say how I travel to my college on a typical day and how I feel about the journey.\n\nMy father owns a car and I mostly use it to travel to and from my college. This is a Honda SUV and is quite comfortable. My college is around twenty kilometres away from our home. Considering the road traffic, it takes me around an hour or so to reach there.\n\nI would say I enjoy this daily journey. During my second year, I had to take public buses to commute to my college for about three to four months. The experience of commuting in public transportation was not pleasant and it killed more times per day. Comparing to this experience, I would say I am happy and content to have a private car to reach my college.\n\nI get ready at around 7.00 in the morning, eat my breakfast, and get ready for the college. Afterwards, I call our driver to start the engine. The car leaves our house at around 7.30 am and reach our college at approximately 8.30 am. During this one hour, I mostly read a newspaper or an academic book. Sometimes, when I do not feel like reading, I enjoy the view on both sides of the road. The only time I dislike this journey when our car gets stuck due to the bad traffic. In some occasions, let's say once or twice in a month, the traffic is so bad that I have to wait for about two hours, double than the usual time, to reach my college. Apart from the chocking traffic jam and delay, I mostly enjoy my journey to my medical college."

I really appreciate the opportunity to let me talk about my experience of commuting to and from my office.\n\nI am lucky that the doctors in our city are privileged to have official transportation. The hospital, where I work in, has a full spectrum of bus service that carries office staffs. Mercedes-Benz buses usually carry us and it can take around 20 people at a time. One of the designated buses picks me up from my home early in the morning, and sometimes in the afternoon based on my hospital duty schedule. I would say the bus is comfortable and I like to ride in it to commute to and from my office rather than taking my own car.\n\nThe hospital is around 80 miles from my residence and it takes me less than one and a half hour to reach there in the early morning. If I take the same journey in the evening - when the traffic is usually heavy, sometimes it takes me more than two hours.\n\nAs far as I know, the hospital authority has four buses that are exclusively dedicated to carrying the doctors and nurses of the hospital. So I take one of these four buses every day. They look so identical that it's hard to tell the differences, you know what I mean. Since the drivers are also in shifting duty, I cannot be sure who will drive the bus the next morning!\n\nI like the journey except for the time when the traffic is bad and we are stuck on the road. I usually carry a book or a magazine that I read on the bus. Sometimes, I listen to music and try to enjoy the side view. But often I have to be on the phone while I travel, though I do not like it very much, to discuss professional matters. On the way back home, I often take a nap to refresh myself and its funny that I can sleep for a while on the bus almost every day after a busy and tiresome working day."

    "Answer": "Being the capital city of German for more than 800 years, Berlin in Germany is long recognized as a gigantic world city of culture, politics, media and science where people flock in from all over the world in order to enjoy its very diverse mix of sights.\n\nThere are just so many things to see and do in Berlin and it is not easy to decide where to start. But, I would say that people go to this place probably because it is a city full of flamboyant and interesting people, buzzing with the bohemian culture, and it is without a doubt, the coolest place in Europe. But, if it's not for the exuberant atmosphere of Berlin, people go for, it's probably the extensive history of over two thousand years, and if not for that, it's probably for the mouth-watering foods and beer. Whether one wants to take a boat tour, hang out at the beach or enjoy the amazing nightlife, Berlin has it all. \n\nWhatever the reasons may be, Berlin is a very popular place among the visitors because of its plethora of green spaces, swimming lakes and more than 2,500 public parks and gardens that offer locals and visitors a sight of mesmerizing natural beauty to enjoy. But if someone is into learning a bit of history,  he or she can certainly see Berlin Wall at East Side Gallery (left standing as a sign of German reunification in 1990), chilling Holocaust Memorial, the Stasi Museum, the German Historical Museum and the Book Burning Square. The city is also known for its art scene and modern landmarks like the gold-coloured, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, which was built in 1963. \n\nAttracting about 5 million tourists every year, Berlin is popular not just because it reminds the turbulent 20th-century history of Germany up to the Cold War time, but it also remains as one of the most popular and safe tourist destinations in the world."

    "Answer": "Teluk Kemang - a beautiful beach located in the south of Port Dickson is a very popular beach area in our country which is visited by a large number of people every day. White sands washed by the seawater, harmonic sound of the waves, and a lavish scenic beauty make this place in Negeri Sembilan a favourite destination to many local and foreign tourists. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to allow me to talk about a popular place in my country.\n\nHolidaymakers love the clear sea water - which is deep blue, soft white sands, fine sand beach and the annual Port Dickson Festival very much. Young and old alike come here to enjoy the natural beauty of the beach. Moreover, great hotels, holiday resorts and other amenities attract many tourists. In fact, the visitor facilities and amenities are abundant in this area and tourists love to rush in to enjoy their time here.\n\nI had been to this place twice and I was really surprised by the blissful surroundings. Interestingly, the sea remains fairly constant regardless of high or low tide, and I believe this tranquillity of the sea allows the visitors not to wade far out to get a decent depth while bathing and it gives them a sense of safety.\n\nPeople can enjoy a very calm and blue sea and refresh their mind once they are at Teluk Kemang. My personal experience of the sunset eve was exceptional. Adventure seekers, mostly young people, hire water scooters or boats and have fun while others can settle for giant inner tubes to float around in the water. Right next to the beach, a visitor can find many stalls that sell a vast variety of goods and souvenirs.\n\nI believe this place is usually packed with tourists because it is beautiful and offers great hotels and resorts to stay in with the whole family. I would like to attribute this beach's popularity to the soft white sand and the clear blue water surrounded by a vast blue sky. The beach offers activities to young and old alike and people like to drop by at this popular beach and enjoy their time."

    "Answer": "Born in the USA during the mid 19th century, Thomas Alva Edison is perhaps the most famous and influential inventors of all time. Prominent inventions like the phonograph, the electric light bulb, the motion picture camera, and the mass communication system are a few of his transcendent works. He is often credited as America's greatest inventor. I'd like to profoundly thank you to let me talk about this great mind whose inventions and work have shaped the pathway for the modern world.\n\nThomas Edison was a genius and very inquisitive from his early childhood. He was a prolific inventor, holding more than a thousand patents in his name. Despite suffering from hearing loss, having only 12 weeks of formal education, and experiencing a bumpy ride in early childhood, he invented and develops so many wonderful devices, perhaps due to his extraordinary mental and physical stamina.\n\nPhonograph - device for the mechanical recording and reproduction of sound was perhaps his greatest invention. He also worked to improve the microphone for telephone, devised a commercially viable electric bulb, expanded DC power delivery system, designed fluoroscope  - a machine that uses the X-ray to take radiographs, improved telegraphs, enhanced motion picture camera and the mass communication system. However, the list of his invention is simply overwhelming and their utilisations are mostly practical in our daily life.\n\nEdison - as a person and a scientist - had so many interesting and intriguing facts and in fact, I have already mentioned two or three of them. To reciprocate, he didn't learn to talk until almost four years old, had only 12 weeks of schooling, sold newspaper and candy on the railroad, suffered almost a total loss of hearing, had a great number of patents in his name and so on.\n\nDefinitely, his inventions and works are still important. He had, in a way, shaped the foundation for the scientific development in the modern era. We just have to look at the electric lights and telephones we have in our house to understand how rich his contributions still are in our life. He literally eliminated darkness around us to give us a luminous world."

    "Answer": "Having been born in 1879 at a place called “Ulm” in Germany, Einstein was an “average” student in his class, but showed some keen interests in science and mathematics. Little did anybody know at that time that he, as the first born of a Jewish couple called Hemann and Pauline Einstein, would one day change the course of history in science and physics. \n\nEinstein worked on many things like Brownian movement theory or the zigzag motion of microscopic particles in suspension, the quantum theory of light” and the “theory of relativity” in which Einstein explained that time and motion are relative to their observers as long as the speed of light remains constant. However, his most famous work, in my opinion, was the invention of the formula E = mc2, relating mass and energy, which later on formed much of the basis for nuclear energy. \n\nOf course, we all already know about these inventions, but what many of us perhaps didn’t know that Einstein renounced his German citizenship when he was just 16. We also perhaps didn’t know that he married the female student in his physics class at Zürich Polytechnic in Switzerland. By the way, Einstein also spent all his prize money to pay for the divorce of his first wife. The fact that surprises me the most about him is that Einstein was asked to be Israel's second president, but he refused, stating that he had \"neither the natural ability nor the experience to deal with human beings\". But then I wonder this is exactly one of the most prolific scientists of all time would and should do!\n\nHis inventions are still important and will remain so for a long, long time as it pretty much changed the idea of energy, motion and light, and how we use them to our advantage. In fact, the global positioning system, which we use today in our mobile applications, wouldn’t function without special and general relativity. Besides, Solar panels (photovoltaic panels) which convert the sun’s energy into electricity, and the photocell eyes, which are installed on the sides of the automatic doors, rely on the photoelectric effect, explained by Einstein. Finally, the electricity, that we use, is the result of nuclear energy, derived from his famous formula E = mc2."

    "Answer": "When I learned to play the violin, a stringed musical instrument with an Italian origin, at a very tender age of 8, little did I know back then that it had such a widespread use which ranges from symphony orchestra to jazz ensembles as well as film scores to Indian “ragas”. Now, that I look back, I sure am glad that I learned to play this “perfect” musical instrument.\n\nPlaying the violin can be “self-learned”, or it can be learned by taking lessons from a teacher. After playing this great musical instrument for more than 20 years, I have learned that posture is very important in order to enhance the sound quality of a violin.  \n\nAnyway, to play a violin, all you need is a bow stick, a firm shoulder for your violin to rest on, Rosin (a sticky “resin” that helps the bow make sound when it comes in contact with a violin string), a good musical piece with which you really feel attuned with and of course a violin. First, put the violin on your shoulder while also touching it with your “chin”. Then, draw the bow stick up and down on violin strings while regulating the sounding length of the strings with the fingers of the left hand by stopping them against the fingerboard in order to produce different notes. Now, from the description above, one may be tempted to believe that violin can be learned easily, but in fact, it can take some real time and efforts to learn to play this musical instrument. \n\nI like playing the violin because it carries the perfect sound of melody which helps express a musician's “emotion” just so perfectly! I also like the violin because it can create several kinds of voices of my likings, depending on how the instrument is manipulated by the musician. Besides, the violin is really versatile as it offers options to play anything from classical music to a mournful gipsy strain. Finally, I like it because of its “portability” as I can carry and play it anywhere."

    "Answer": "Thank you Sir/Madam for this great topic. I am a big fan of music but when it comes to singing or playing a musical instrument, I am just a novice. The guitar is perhaps the only musical instrument I know how to play (but I'm not an expert), and I would like to talk about it.\n\nThe guitar is a stringed instrument and it has six strings of unequal thickness strung tightly side-by-side across a fretboard. Musical notes of different pitches are produced by plucking the strings while pressing the attached strings against the fretboard or fingerboard. The guitar is capable of producing more than 130 different types of musical notes and someone needs years of dedicated practice to master the skill of playing this amazing instrument.\n\nAn expert guitarist can produce a variety of music from it. The guitar is perhaps one of the most widely used musical instruments in the world. If you ask me how long have I been playing it, I will be in trouble to answer that! Maybe I should explain why! Though I owned a guitar in my teenage, I never really learned to play it (I mean playing it without embarrassing myself) until I got admitted to the college. Afterwards, I have sometimes practised it and often left it untouched for several consecutive weeks. But I always believed someday I will learn to play this instrument. Since I am a hobbyist guitarist, I cannot claim that I have been playing it for a particular number of years - you know what I mean.\n\nBut if you ask me whether I like the guitar - the answer is ‘yes, absolutely’. This is an incredible musical instrument that has the ability to produce surreal music and enchant the audiences. It is a genuinely versatile and convenient musical instrument loved by millions around the world. A great song without the use of guitar is almost impossible, at least in my country."

    "Answer": "Thank you very much for this topic. I will tell you about a food court where I have been to many times and also explain why it is popular among visitors besides mentioning where it is located, what it looks like and what types of food are served by them.\n\nBeing built at the top floor of one of the most famous shopping malls in my home town, the food court attracts thousands of customers every day not only from my home town but also out of the town. Why? Well, the answer is obvious. They all want to enjoy a bite of their favourite food after finishing their shopping spree.\n\nTaking the entire top floor, the food court sits on an area of about ten thousand square feet with more than fifty restaurants and fast food corners which serves pretty much all kinds of foods. If you are in a mood to spend some quality times with your friends and families over some formal dinners at an Italian, Chinese or Indian restaurant, you can certainly do so. But, if you are in a hurry and want some quick food and snacks, you can always grab a burger or sandwich from a McDonalds or Burger King. Whenever I visit this food court, I always find that the place is occupied with hundreds of customers, eating their favourite food while making “clicking” sound of their spoons hitting the plates. In fact, the food court looks pretty much like a giant “food market” to me with a very organized sitting arrangement, having tables and chairs all around the food court for individuals and groups alike. \n\nJust by looking at the size of the crowds at the food court, it can be said that the food court is very popular not only among the city dwellers but also among the people from outside of the city. This is a very popular food court also because this doesn’t just attract the shoppers, who come to the mall for shopping, but it also attracts those people, young and old alike, who visit the food court only to eat their favourite food. Some even come just to “see” the grand looking food court!"

    "Answer": "I am grateful to you for this nice topic. I will try to tell you about a food court where I have been to several times and enjoyed the food and service they provide. I often meet my friends at this very place and I believe it is quite popular among the local residents.\n\nTo begin with, this food court is on the sixth floor of a shopping complex which is only 15 minutes drive away from my living place. So naturally, it is easy for me to reach there whenever I want!\n\nThese days, food courts and fast food shops are springing up all over the place - they are even spreading across the residential area and are quite famous among local inhabitants. The food court I am talking about occupies the entire 6th floor and has more than 25 stalls selling all sorts of local food, international cuisine, different types of deserts and drinks.\n\nLast month I went there with two of my friends to enjoy a meal and we had a large pizza and a few glasses of smoothies. Different stalls in this food court mainly offer rice, fish, chicken, mutton, naan roti, kebab, soups, spring onions, and a variety of sushi as traditional Chinese cuisine, and different other western food. Pizza and steak are perhaps famous among youngsters and rice & soup among adults. These shops open early in the morning and serve food to customers till 10.00 pm.\n\nThis place looks like any other traditional food court in our city but it has a far better sitting arrangement. All these shops give free samples to attract new customers and they often offer a special menu to regular customers. From a distance, it looks packed, especially during the lunch hours, but once you're there to enjoy your meal, you will notice a vibrant and lively vibe, full of young people enjoying their food and their animated conversations.\n\nFrom the number of people go there each day, one can say that it is quite a popular food court. If you are ever there, the busy waiters and the sound of the cash registers would give you an impression that a large number of people like to have their meals at this place. Foreign tourists who like to enjoy local food at a reasonable price often pick this location, perhaps they find this place from Google Local and Foursquare. From my experience, I can say that it’s a popular place to enjoy meals and drinks and to hang out with friends."

    "Answer": "Malaysia, as a country, has made tremendous progress over the last few decades in various sectors. In fact, with a small population of more than 30 million, Malaysia has become the 26th richest country in terms of total GDP (PPP) number which is $1.068 trillion for the year 2019. Besides, Malaysia is the 9th most popular tourist destination, ahead of countries like Germany. However, the progress, I want to talk about today as far as my country is concerned, is the progress in the education sector, especially in tertiary educational level.\n\nThere was a growing sense of discomfort and concerns among fresh graduates up until recently who were unable to gain employment upon graduation because of not having the relevant skills, as well as opportunity to strike out on their own. To deal with these concerns, the Malaysian Ministry of Education has already incorporated very sophisticated technology and translational research” (translating academic research into practical solutions to benefit the industry, academia, government and society) into our educational system in order to change the concept of teaching and learning at the higher education level.  \n\nThe ministry of education has also implemented a “Gap Year programme” at eight public universities to give their students one year of break from studies or work to pursue other interests, generally different from his regular life or line of work the chance, in order to volunteer at government agencies so that they can pursue some very important on-the-job experiences. As for technology, the existing Malaysian Research and Education Network’s (Myren) online ecosystem to Myren-X - a 100-gigabit high speed broadband infrastructure has been put in place in order to increases bandwidth capacity at public universities to a maximum of 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) for the purpose of enabling big data research and experimentations. On top of that, our education ministry has also introduced the Malaysia English Assessment (MEA) scheme, embedded in the Ecosystem for English Language Learning and Assessment in Higher Education, to nurture holistic, entrepreneurial and “balanced” graduates into our work pools.\n \nIt all started in 2015, and it will continue for some times. But the progress is already benefitting my country. I certainly feel good about the progress our education system has made so far as it is already on its way to becoming the regional educational hub. In fact, a significant number of students from our neighbouring countries has already come to study at our universities and colleges. Another thing that I really like about our educational system is that we can actually access overseas education online while also enabling foreigners to access our education system at the same time and bring Malaysian education overseas. But the best thing about our new educational approach is that it has already managed to boost the reputation of some of our colleges and universities by raising the public’s confidence in our nation’s ability to provide quality higher education just like any other “developed” nations even though we are not quite there yet."

    "Answer": "I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for the chance you have given me to talk about a contemporary advancement that our country has witnessed. The development work that I am going to talk about was much anticipated and highly desired, and I believe it will be enormously positive for the country and the citizens.\n\nProgress, in my opinion, is a meaningful improvement or development in an area or sector to have something better than it is used to be. When a country progresses, it ensures better living standard to its citizens. However, not all progress or development works come without negative consequences.\n\nMy country - (say your country's name), has recently completed a highly ambitious project known as Kankas Super Highway. This project has taken more than two decades, and now it ensures better inland communication and transportation throughout the country. In terms of the outcome, it has connected several districts with the capital city and people are already getting benefits from this grand project. Many experts believe that it will dramatically change the trade and transport facilities in our country, especially for people from rural areas.\n\nThe scheme was initiated in 1998 and took almost 20 years to finish. However, I have read in a recent newspaper article that some works are still going on, perhaps those were planned at a later phase, and the ministry of rural transportation has allocated more budget to add diversity to this development work. For instance, the rail transportation system is expected to be integrated with this project and I guess, this work is still ongoing.\n\nIt makes me sad that the development works didn't come without a price we were not ready to pay. We had to sacrifice two small forests, vast agricultural lands and a few hilly areas- the natural habitat of the flora and fauna, not to mention the overwhelming number of trees that had been cut down to carry on the project. I hope we would be able to take some initiatives to cover the loss, at least a portion of it, and make sure the progress in the transportation sector ensures a better life for all citizens.\n\nConsidering the advantages, I am quite positive this progress will bring tremendous benefits. The old highway didn't connect all parts of the country to the capital city and couldn't cope with the number of increasing vehicles running on the roads. Now that the development works are almost done, people from any part of the country have better access to the capital city and that would definitely improve our overall trade facilities, and as a result, people will get better access to education, treatment, and employment."

    "Answer": "It would not be an exaggeration to say that modern society is built by the young, is for the young, and doesn't give much consideration to the old. This is an aspect of modern society that I really abhor. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to talk about this.\n\nNo doubt, modern society is dynamic and has eliminated many old dogmas and created better opportunities for its members. But it is a disturbing development that old people are no longer treated with the respect they really deserve and this issue is widespread. It seems like modern society has taught us to evaluate the worth of people by their status, earthly possessions, productivity and physical strength. Thus many young people behave as if our senior members are our reliability and this is a heinous aspect of modern society that I really dislike.\n\nI cannot say for sure why the youth of the modern era has started possessing this mentality, but I can realise that the slack of the family bond has surely fueled it up. We are trying to run so fast to reach our dreams that we even forget our parents. Thus many unfortunate parents, at their old age, are being forced to pine the lives away in an old folks’ home. Many young, regrettably, don't bother to care for their parents, and they are not expected to respect the elders.\n\nI can't be one hundred per cent sure if this is a fairly new development or a comparatively old one. One thing I am sure about that the past century was different. No doubt, the term ‘generation gap’ was always present but it doesn't mean older people used to be treated as a burden in the past.\n\nThe modern society is certainly not kind to the old generation and I have acute reasons to loathe it. I can clearly visualise the degradation of the young generation for their lack of respect for the old. This is just the beginning and if this trend continues, they will become more selfish. Power and wealth are not the pillars of the development and I believe we should be grateful to our ancestors for everything they have done for us. And it is the time for the youth to repay and respect some of these contributions."

    "Answer": "We just love living in our modern society which has gone \"all digital\" in recent years. And why shouldn’t we? With so many LED screens, TVs, laptops, computers and smartphones around us the last thing, that perhaps ever crosses our minds, is that going “all digital” just might not be in the best interest of our physical and mental health after all. Well, yes, we are talking about a rather important but recent phenomenon of our society which has consumed us for the most part by “forcing” us to spend way more time in front of our digital media screens.\n\nThis is happening primarily because digital technology has crept into our everyday lives and across all other activities in such a way that we just can’t seem to ignore our laptops or smartphones or stop interacting with our digital media, no matter how hard we try, because of the kinds of information, we consume, on a daily basis. In fact, the research shows that in today’s world, the average adult consumes five times more information every day than their counterpart 50 years ago.\n\nAnother reason of this trend is the “instant gratification” where we are trying to provide ourselves with some kinds of “fake but easy way out” from our monotonous and tiring lives by constantly tweeting, texting, posting likes, sharing things, Googling and checking emails messages on social media networks for no obvious reasons.\n\nNeedless to say, of course, I don’t exactly like this rather unhealthy “trend” of spending too much time in front of our digital media screens because of its negative impacts on our mental and physical health, especially when it comes to socializing with our families, relatives and friends. As a result, children are becoming less and less interested in making friends at their schools while parents are also becoming more and more distant from their children due to checking their smartphones and digital televisions like they just can’t get enough of it. In fact, going out to enjoy a lovely meal at a family restaurant or meeting friends to have a football match out in a field, instead of actually pushing the buttons of our smartphones and TV remotes, are becoming things of the past which certainly doesn’t augur well for our mental and physical health.  \n\nAnd as a result, we are not only becoming more and more depressed and grumpy (sometimes, even violent) but also “obese” and “sleep deprived”, let alone the dangers of “digital eye strains” due to staring at the digital screens for a long period of time.  Anyway, our modern society has given us innumerable “benefits”, but it certainly helps to understand how much of those benefits we actually need."

    "Answer": "A house,  an address, a place to live – whatever we call it, we all know that we need one. But the unfortunate reality is that not everybody has a house, nor all of us have the ability to buy one despite our best efforts. So, when I came to know a few months ago that my elder brother has bought a house in a city nearby where we lived, I became very happy.\n\nThe house is about 2200 square feet with 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a kitchen and 3 balconies, located nearby a small lake.  Built with brick, cement, iron rods and sand, it isn’t exactly a new house even though my brother had to pay a fortune to buy this place. When you go inside the house, you will find a hall and a sitting room on the opposite of the main entrance door. Having a big kitchen on the left, this house also has a corridor on the right leading to a common bathroom and bedrooms. Standing tall next to a major intersection and a couple of other streets in the city, the house is easily accessible pretty much from all directions.\n\nMy first impression about this house was it had a lot of stories to tell with its waning down paintings and “cracked floors” both inside and outside of the house. Having remained closed probably for a long time, the house looked to be in a “damp” condition because of not receiving enough air and sunlight, I suppose.\n\nHowever, the best thing about this house is it is spacious enough to accommodate all of our family members, including myself and our parents, with enough rooms to run and play for my little nephew and nieces. Besides, having a lake nearby is like a “gift”, if you are living in a city, which will certainly provide the kids with an opportunity to interact with the “nature” from time to time. Finally, having bought this “old” house, I think, my elder brother has offered himself a “window of opportunity” to remodel it by becoming a bit innovative without spending too much money which wouldn’t probably be possible had he bought a completely new house with everything in perfect condition."

I will tell where it is located, how it looks like and my impression of this house.\n\nMy cousin Andrew who has bought the house is a doctor and he had been planning to own a house ever since he got married. Finally, he bought a new house in (... say an area name…) and a few months ago I visited this residence. This is an emerging area in the city and a number of housing projects are still ongoing. It takes around an hour to reach there from the National Art Gallery - which is located at the zero-point of the city. So in terms of its location, it’s situated in a convenient area as it is adjacent to the city centre and yet free from the city crowd. As I have noticed during my last visit, many government agencies, two private universities and a few private organisations have been relocated to this area.\n\nAndrew’s house is a two storey modern house and it occupies around 5000 square feet area in total. It has a small garden in front of it which makes it even more beautiful. On the ground floor, it has three bedrooms, a guest room, a dining room, a large kitchen and a small playground while the first floor has four large bedrooms - each with an attached bathroom, and finally a hall room. The spacious living and dining rooms have gorgeous marble floors and Andrew took professional advice of an interior designer before he decorated the house.\n\nMy first impression of the house is quite excellent. As soon as I reached there, I felt that an individual house is way better than an apartment in a large building. I wish we have had such a house instead of our apartment on a busy street in the city! The house is very beautiful and it looks quite attractive. I am sure my cousin and his family enjoy living there."

But this is life, and bad things happen to us whether we like it or not as the scars of treachery are still fresh in my mind. I would like to thank you for this topic and I will share my experience when someone I trusted stabbed me in the back.\n\nIt was about five years ago when I felt betrayed by none other than my old time friend Andrew, whom I thought I knew for more than 15 years since my childhood. I can still vividly remember the day when he asked for our motorcycle (my family owned a motorcycle back then) as he “supposedly” needed it to run for some “errands”, ensuring me that he would be back in 10 minutes. Having complete faith in him, I gave the motorcycle to my friend, who lived only a 10- minute walk away from me, without notifying my parents.  \n\nI waited for 10 minutes, by my friend was yet to come. I waited for another 20 minutes, but still no sign of my friend. My father started to ask me about the motorcycle, but I, still having faith on my friend, told them that my “friend” would be back in 30 minutes. When there was no sign of my friend even after 30 minutes had passed, I became worried and a bit annoyed at the same time. However, my “friend” did arrive after six straight hours, but he arrived with a broken motorcycle that required a lot of works to get fixed. When confronted, my friend said that he wasn’t at any fault, and that the accident had taken place because of another person’s fault. However, later on, I found out that he had taken the motorcycle far beyond the distance he was supposed to travel with another guy. I also found out that it was because of his fault that the accident had taken place as he was riding motorbike real fast. In other words, he lied to me the whole time.\n\nNot sure why he lied to me, but I felt really bad and sad not because of the broken motorcycle, but because I felt that I was duped by a person whom I have always tried to help. Having seen the “deceit” in him, I kept wondering myself about how many times he might have lied to me in the past, or how many times he may have taken advantage of me by lying to me! What was even worse that I chose to lie to my parents because I wanted to save a “so-called” friend who turned out to be a plain “lair” later on! Needless to say, after that terrible incident, I promised to myself that I would never let myself in a position again where I would feel “betrayed” and “deserted”."

    "Answer": "Deception and betrayal are more widespread today than in the past. It is a shame that it has become more common and somewhat of a daily occurrence and used to be considered an unmentionable sin in the past. Unfortunately, I have got cheated a number of times by others but for the sake of my cue card, today I will share the worst incident when I got cheated by a close friend of mine whom I believed. That was shocking and unexpected for me and the bitter feeling still linger.\n\nIn 2016 when I was doing my post-graduation, and in the last semester, it was mandatory for us to submit a software project for 200 marks. At that time, almost everyone from my class was assisting companies of their choices to make a project for the final submission and others were buying it from various companies, though this was not legit. Although an internship was not mandatory, still students were ready to do anything for their final submission. Neither I was financially capable to purchase a software project nor was I able to do an internship with the companies. Finally, I decided to do it on my own and with the help of the internet. And I finally did that. I painstakingly finished the project and spent many sleepless nights to complete it.\n\nI had a friend in my class, who was in the same situation as mine and she was struggling with it. Just for humanity's sake, I would not express her real name. Let's assume that her name was Raima. She belonged to a poor family and didn’t even have her own laptop. I decided to help her by submitting my individual project as a group project. For this purpose, I gave her all my work details to revise it before the final submission date.\n\nRegrettably, that was my biggest mistake in my life, as she cheated me on that and submitted my project as her own individual project a week prior to the submission date. That was unexpected and was an act against morality. I was deceived so badly that I lost faith in helping others. I was trying to help her and she stabbed me from back as a reward! I was so crestfallen and dismayed that I felt helpless and depressed for a couple of days. \n\nBut luckily I had the blueprints of that project in my email and I was able to prove to my professors that I actually prepared that project. That was tough for me and took a great deal of effort but I was happy to find that deception did not win over morality and humanity."

    "Answer": "I would like to take the chance to thank you first for this excellent topic. It is indeed a great subject to talk about. \n\nOur society evolves and changes over time. Some changes are so prolific that it ensures a better life for all, and sometimes small changes impact our society beyond our expectation. Such an important change in our country is women's participation in higher education. \n\nLooking back to the past century, women were confined at home and it was beyond our imagination that they could be equally adept as men and participate to build our society. It was a curse not only for the females but also for the whole society to consider that women should only take care of household tasks and produce babies each year -what a shame. Some education, mostly primary schooling, were allowed for females but parents considered higher education for the female is a waste of time and money. As a result, our universities had a very limited number of female students.\n\nThe change did not happen overnight and thanks to some fearless female social activists who fought for their rights to education. Their lifelong struggle and motivational activities inspired a thousand others - both females and progressive males. Besides, the government helped a lot to fight the social dogma and old belief, and a collaborative effort from the government, female social activists, writers, scientists, politicians and most importantly ordinary people have changed the very social norm of not sending females to universities. The whole process took more than six decades or so in my country. But it is obvious that the human history of restricting women from education and other basic rights goes more than a few centuries.  \n\nWe now have an almost equal number of female and male pupils and scholars in our universities. In some majors, females even exceed the number of their male counterparts. As a result, our society has a great number of female doctors, researchers, executives, politicians, artists, advocates, teachers, security personnel and so on. This is a great sign of social equality and parity. It ensures better social and economic developments and the GDP in recent years only denote how important a change it was for us. Women empowerment has raised awareness, has given women a \"strong voice\" and eliminated many discriminations we have had in our society."

    "Answer": "Our societies around us are always changing of which we tend to welcome some while, with some other changes, we become really worried as they tend to affect all of us very negatively. Drug addiction, YABA addiction more precisely, is such a “dreadful change”, which we could certainly do away with, that has poisoned my country for the last 2 decades or so.\n\nThe “menace of yaba” began when the “separatist groups” in Myanmar (formerly called “Burma”) started to produce this “dreadful drug” called yaba, a combination of methamphetamine (a powerful and addictive stimulant) and caffeine, in order to raise their funds. Bangladesh, being a bordering country with Myanmar, with its huge unemployed youth and “newly-introduced” affluent societies, naturally became a magnet for this “poisonous stimulant”. Being manufactured at more than 37 factories inside Myanmar, this deadly “anti-depressant” drug has affected more than 7 million people in my country. This “yaba” drug menace was under control of some sort up until 2006, but standing in 2019, the situation has spiralled out of control since then, as the government has finally decided to crack down on drug offences, involving yaba, by declaring “death penalty”.\n\nThe Implications of this yaba drug abuse are just too many to count, having created havoc in the lives of millions and their families in terms of serious degradation in health and moral values over the last two decades. In fact, many families in my country are suffering from a terrible “social paranoia” whereby they are constantly worried about their kids being involved in using “yaba”. In many cases, because of the extreme dependence on “yaba”, the drug addicts have indulged in many immoral and criminal activities, creating some serious “social unrest and despair” in my country. Even incidents like killing one’s own “parents” (both father and mother) by young children have taken place in my country to satisfy their demands for “yaba”.  And the list goes on.\n\nIf we don’t become really serious about this “yaba menace”, the chances are that a large portion of our generation of “youth” in my country would get completely lost and wasted very much in detriment to our societies and country as a whole."

    "Answer": "My nephew just loved eating German chocolate cake whether there was an occasion for it or not. But an occasion makes it even more fun as you get to share it with your friends and families alike. The occasion was a birthday party of my nephew (my brother’s elder son who turned 7) about a couple of months ago, and we decided to celebrate it with a big German chocolate cake. It had to be a big cake as per the “order” of my nephew since he wanted to invite all of his classmates from his elementary class!\n\nThe search for the best kind of cake was in full force as I, along with my brother, started hitting the cake baking shops one after another. We even tried a few pieces of cakes ourselves in an attempt to find the best kind(s). Then, after spending a hectic 3 hours in the streets/shops, we found what we were exactly looking for, and immediately decided to order for one. The big brown German chocolate cake, with no less weight than 20 pounds, would be ready after one week. Finally, we were ready to celebrate the best birthday ever, at least my nephew thought so!\n\nWas it a special cake? Of course, it was a very a special cake not because of its signature taste from the best kind of melted chocolate, buttermilk, whipped egg whites and coconut pecan filling, but because how it made my nephew and his friends feel special and happy. It was a heavenly sight to see a bunch of kids laughing, playing and enjoying each other’s company over a cake (my kind nephew didn’t forget to offer me a slice even though he was busy with his friends). Besides, it was a special cake to me because the cake was baked according to my specific instructions such as making the cake a bit thinner than usual, and not using too much sour cream in it for the purpose of ensuring a better taste.\n\nSo, how exactly did the cake taste? Well, you know that the cake tasted “awesome” when a bunch of kids asks for just the same kind of cake with the same taste everyday!"

    "Answer": "A cake is an inevitable part of a birthday celebration and without blowing the birthday candle and cutting the cake, a birthday party seems incomplete. Thank you very much for this great topic and I would like to share my experience of celebrating my mom's birthday for which I bought a special cake.\n\nIt was my mom's birthday in the middle of June last year and I planned with my sister to make it special by rejoicing the day. My parents are very enthusiastic about celebrating our birthday every year but when it comes to revelling their birthday, they are quite adamant and gives different excuses. Last year, we celebrated my mom's birthday without even letting her know about it. I and my sister went to a large bakery shop earlier that day and picked a 3-pound eggless truffle cake, which is my mom's favourite, and we purchased the cake to surprise her.\n\nIn the evening a few relatives and two friends of mine came to our house and we asked my mom to come to my room. All the birthday arrangements including the cake and gifts were well hidden in my room. When my parents entered my room, a bunch of surprises were waiting for them. My parents became speechless and I was so happy to see their smile. My mother cut the cake and we sang the birthday song for her. It was a large cake considering the number of people and we all enjoyed it. Later that night we went to a renowned Chinese restaurant and enjoyed our dinner.\n\nThe cake was special because it was meant for the birthday of a very special person in our life - my mother. I have bought many cakes including birthday cakes on different occasions but purchasing a cake for my mother was something truly special as it made her happy. It was not merely a cake but a gesture of our love for her and our gratefulness for everything she has done and still doing for us."

    "Answer": "I am glad to have such a nice topic to talk about and I would like to thank you for the opportunity.\n\nIn our life, we often face challenges and obstacles that are tough to overcome all by ourselves. A little help from others can save the day and no matter how much we criticise the human race for being self-centred, we can't deny the selfless acts that we are often offered by others, even sometimes by complete strangers. Thus a few months ago someone named Khalif Ashraf did something truly kind for which I will always remember this benevolent soul.\n\nI was in Penang island in Malaysia last year with my wife and my four years old daughter on our holiday. As soon as we arrived on the island from the Muscat International Airport, we realised that the island was getting ready for the Chinese New Year and due to this, it was packed with the tourists. We hired a taxi and the driver was a local resident who introduced himself as Khalif Ashraf and he was in his mid-thirties. We realised his friendly attitude as soon as we got in his car. It was already 10.00 pm and my daughter and wife were very tired. I had a list of a few hotels to stay in and told the driver to take us to these hotels. Unfortunately, none of the hotels had any room they could offer us. Things were getting disordered and we were hoping to get a room by any mean.\n\nMr Ashraf, our taxi driver, understood our dilemma and offered to take us to a few hotels he knew personally. Initially, I was confused as my previous experience taught me that taxi drivers often get commissions by bringing guests to below-standard hotels which charge a hefty amount. However, I agreed to his proposition and he did a remarkable job by finding a nice hotel for us at a comparatively cheaper price. I was taken aback when he told the hotel manager to give us a 20% discount for which he used one of his identification cards. It was completely unexpected and so kind an act that I will never forget it.\n\nI felt more perplexed when he denied taking the taxi rent for the extra distance he drove us to this hotel. It was a great example of kindness and empathy. He even called me the next day and met us with a few gifts for my daughter. This event was an acute reminder for me to trust humanity."

    "Answer": "Getting stranded in the middle of a night out of nowhere is certainly not a good feeling when you are alone. But, that’s exactly what happened to me about a couple of years ago when I was coming back to my home in my old 4-door sedan car on a late evening after finishing some important works at my company factory. The factory was about a 2-hour drive from my home which I needed to visit at least once in a month or so. But, on that day, when I decided to hit the road after finishing my work, it was already 10:00 pm.\n\nI felt really tired after finishing my work. So, I decided to take a little rest on the roadside in my old car which, as I think of it now, wasn’t exactly a very good idea as I fell asleep. Not sure, how long I had slept, but when I woke up, it was about 12:20 pm and I needed to drive at least another hour or so to reach my home. However, after driving probably about 20 minutes, the car started to act on me and then eventually coming to a complete stop. I tried to fix the car, but I couldn’t really do anything about it as it looked like the car engine was dead, leaving me wondering in a place with no home or stores nearby in sight. I called my car “towing” company, but what they told me wasn’t really very encouraging as it would have taken them at least 40 minutes to reach me. So, anyway, I just decided to wait inside my car while asking for a ride occasionally, but nobody was really in a mood to help me out. Then, suddenly, came my ‘saviour” just when I was getting ready to spend the rest of the night inside my “dead” car.   \n\nIntroducing himself as Mr. Raymond, he was kind enough to ask me whether I needed him to help me fix my car, or I needed him to give me a ride. I requested him to rather give me a ride after explaining to him about my dead car engine. He gladly obliged. Not knowing where he was from, or what kind of person he really was (I guess, it was the fear of “unknown”), I decided to accept his help, leaving my car on the road by itself for it to be “towed” later on. Anyway, as if he could read what was really going in my mind, he decided to ease my tension by providing me a bit more details about him and his family. When we arrived at my home, it was about 1:00 am at night. I offered Raymond to spend the rest of the night at my place, as it was really late for anybody to go out, but he declined.  \n\nI didn’t really know much about Mr. Raymond as we didn’t really talk much during our little “journey”. But whatever I knew about him after that little chit chat, it was enough for me to conclude that he was ready to help a person in distress any time of the day or night. I felt like I just couldn’t thank him enough for helping me on a night when nobody was really willing to do so. In fact, I thought, it was because of people like Raymond this world was still a safer place for us to live. At the end, when he was ready to hit the road, I requested him to let me know if he ever needed any help not because what he did for me, but because without some “kind” people like Raymond among us, the entire “human race” probably would have been “lost” in its complicated journey."

    "Answer": "When I read the “phrase” for the first at my elementary/primary school, I didn’t quite understand what it really meant. The “phrase” revisited me many times during my high school and college years as well, but I still didn’t fully appreciate its significance and appeal to our overall well-being.\n\nIt actually took an excruciating stomach pain for me to fully understand and appreciate a phrase as “evergreen” as “Heath is Wealth” when my doctor advised me a month ago to walk at least 30 minutes a day in order to ensure better digestion for my suffering stomach. And another 30 minutes if I wanted to get rid of that extra fat which I have amassed at the bottom of my belly! Since then, I started “jogging’ a little even though my body doesn’t quite like to go along with that idea. I would like to thank you for this nice cue card topic.\n\nI am persistent with the routine of a 30-minute “walk” daily. Does walking help our digestive system? The answer is a resounding “yes’, and I have figured it out already after only a couple of weeks of jogging. In fact, the result is more encouraging than what I felt after eating medicines for months. My gastric problem was under control while developing a bit more appetite for foods. In fact, jogging is a very good aerobic exercise as it can improve our blood flow to the digestive tract and speed up metabolism while regulating weight and relieving stress at the same time, which can all then contribute to a healthy and well-functioning digestive system.\n\nAnd once, we are blessed with a perfectly-functioning digestive system, it is highly unlikely that we will attract any digestive diseases such as constipation, gastric or liver problems. Another health benefit of jogging is that it will help burn our unnecessary body fat by using it as “fuel” for tone muscle, which will, of course, result in extra strength and more polished appearance. I am glad that I have started running!"

    "Answer": "Thank you for this interesting topic. I have recently started going to a gymnasium and this is something I have been planning to do for a long. However, I am happy that I am finally doing it and I believe this is something that will bring numerous benefits to me. \n\nFor more than a year, I have been planning to take some outdoor activities to remain fit. I am already in my early thirties and due to my work pressure in the office, I hardly get time to play outdoor sports or walk in the morning or in the evening. I realised how important it is for me to do some sort of exercise considering my age and in the middle of the last January, I became a member of a local gymnasium. After I started visiting the gym each day and doing exercise for about an hour, I have lost more than 8 pounds of my body weight in just three months.\n\nI was slightly overweight before I started the gym. After I shed some weight, I now have a good body mass index. The decision to go to the gym every day was a great one as it has not only helped me lose some of my body weight and remain fit but also helped me to adopt a balanced diet and a healthier lifestyle. I wake up before 6.00 am as I need to go to the gym before 6.45 am and as a result, I go to bed early at night. The gym instructor has recommended me a dietary change and this is also helping me a lot. Since I start my day with some physical exercise, I drink more water each day and feel more energetic throughout the day. I am hoping to continue this routine and expecting more positive changes to live a healthy life."

    "Answer": "I really appreciate the time you have given me to brainstorm and talk about a service which was not up to my expectation and for which I complained.\n\nWell, I was/am never really much of a complaining person even at a time when my minimum expectation is not met. But, this is life, and the reality is we do care about our lives no matter how hard we try not to. Anyway, in the last fall, I was celebrating my friend’s birthday at a nearby restaurant of my choice. I was told that the restaurant had some of the best grilled-fish in the town, and I happened to just love grilled fish. After cutting the cake and wishing our birthday boy, we were finally ready to eat the foods, which we had asked the restaurant manager to arrange at least a week ago of our birthday party.\n\nOur food arrived as per the schedule, and we started to think of eating them one bite at a time slowly, slowly to offer ourselves the “ultimate taste” of a grilled fish except, of course, that some of us stopped immediately after taking the first bite. What might have caused such abrupt interruption, we wondered? Well, in no time, it was revealed that some of the fishes had some foul smell coming out of them. I was quite stunned after learning about the embarrassing news because, after all, it was me who convinced my friends to come to the restaurant.\n\nI rushed to the restaurant manager immediately and complained to him about the food. The manager begged for some times to learn what might have actually transpired in the kitchen. The manager came back in a few minutes and tried to explain to me that the kitchen staffs were not aware of any foul smell and that the fishes were just fine with their natural flavour after grill. But, I wasn’t exactly in a mood then to allow him any space for manoeuvring the situation that had embarrassed me and my friend (the birthday boy) big time. I even threatened to sue the restaurant for causing us such embarrassment.\n\nIt was then the restaurant manager felt compelled to come to a respectable settlement to save our faces. According to the settlement agreement, the restaurant had to serve us with “sirloin beef steak” at half of its original price with free soft drinks (Coca-cola, sprite etc) for all 15 people. I was glad that the settlement worked for both parties without causing any major disconcert between us."

    "Answer": "I am really glad that you have given me an opportunity to talk about this topic. In fact, being able to talk about my negative experience with a service provider in my hometown would shed some of the distress I have had felt for the last few weeks. It is a fairly recent experience and I thank you once again for letting me talk about it.\n\nTwo months ago I contacted a local AC repair service provider, called MR Fixer. My air conditioner malfunctioned and it was producing a loud noise, and the cooling system was inadequate considering the outside temperature. So I decided to have it fixed. I found this agency online and they had a wide range of services. As soon as I called them, they assured me that a technician, who is an expert, would contact me and provide me with the required service at my home. After I gave more details about the problems and the AC that require fixing, they instructed me to pay $70 upfront as a service charge.\n\nI paid the amount online the very next hour but unfortunately, the technician did not call me within the next 48 hours. When I contacted the agency again, someone called me an hour later but did not come to my home as promised. Next day, he showed up and took an hour to fix the issue with the AC. He demanded an additional $15 as his transportation cost which I paid with dismay.\n\nShockingly, the AC was not properly fixed and it started making the noise the very next day. The cooling system was working as expected but the noise was even louder this time. I called the service provider and had to call back several times to find the person who booked my service request - the first sign of terrible customer service.\n\nI explained to him the whole scenario and told him why I am complaining. Initially, he did not cooperate with me and asked me to talk to the technician instead. When I explained that I would rather go to the Consumer Rights Protection Agency and lodge a written complain, he revealed that the technicians were not their permanent employees and the agency can't do anything about it. I was totally frustrated with the experience and vowed never to take their service again. Instead of taking legal actions, I wrote some negative reviews about the company in different online forums and many people responded to the reviews. Someone from the company called me a week ago and told me that if I delete all those negative reviews, they might refund my $70! That was another sign that the whole agency is unreliable and nefarious."

    "Answer": "I was never a very “imaginative” person in the past, bet it in making up a story or making up an excuse. But, all that changed one day during my school years when I was suddenly named to take part in a debate, on a subject which I had no prior knowledge about, instead of another person due to an emergency situation.\n\nThe topic, we were supposed to debate on, was whether the developed countries of the world only should be paying for the greenhouse effects and environmental pollutions thereafter, caused by their industrial emissions, or not. Of course, the problem was that I had no concrete idea about environmental pollution, and as such, I just didn’t know who should have been blamed for damages. But, I needed to deliver my debate on whether I knew about the topics or not. So, I started to imagine (more like delivering my “common sense”) about the possible extreme natural phenomena of my country, like drought, longer summer and shorter winter. Then I also started to imagine about the things which were being done by the developed countries, like the USA, Canada and Japan, but not by poor countries, and thus offering a list of possible reasons for which developed countries should have paid for the environmental damages.\n\nAnyway, I felt like I was stranded in the middle of nowhere with no compass to provide me with any direction as I never cared to learn about any kind of environmental pollution and damages, be them natural or man-made. I also felt like if my team was to lose the debate, it would probably be because of me. However, on the bright side, I also felt like I could at least use my common sense to help my fellow debating partners. In fact, it was very comforting for me as my school authority thought of depending on me to take part in the debate. We lost the debate, of course, but I personally didn’t lose because I stood up for the challenge during the crisis of my team."

    "Answer": "I would like to thank you before I describe a situation when my imagination saved my day. This is a great topic to talk about and it reminds me of the famous Einstein quotation \"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution\".\n\nIt was approximately a year ago and I had to step out of my comfort zone to do well at the global Innovation Solution Competition. Initially, it was a group content but as we progressed to the semi-final round, we had to prove our individual approaches to real-life problems that the authority decided for us. \n\nThis annual contest is open to all undergraduates around the world and we had to contest with more than 30 teams at the initial selection round. Being able to reach the semi-final round was both inspiring and challenging. Therefore, when I was given a problem to solve all by myself, I completely relied on my imagination and winning the tournament as the third-best team in the global competition in Australia was deliriously felicitous and extraordinarily exciting. My task was to propose a feasible solution to the global waste management problem. As soon as I looked at the topic and realised that I had only 2 hours to finish my article of 600 words, I knew that I would have to be extremely imaginative yet creative to propose a great solution.  \n\nThe Innovation Solution Competition recognises individuals and teams who propose practical solutions to pressing global problems to promote creativity and awareness. This competition aims to bring university students from around the globe together and expect them to show their creative thinking to propose solutions to problems the world is facing. Thus it was not a simple competition where I could have done well by proposing something ordinary. This was highly challenging as the other competitors were already working on their own to secure their position to the next round. On top of that, the problem I was given was something new to me.   \n\nI had to buckle down and brainstorm ideas for the challenge until I came up with something I was personally convinced about. The clock was ticking and I was lost in my thoughts for the first couple of minutes. I knew I had to come up with something that would fit in the global context. Fortunately, a convincing idea emerged that I proposed in my article and the next day I was both happy and perplexed to become the runner up on this stage. In the final round, we were announced as the third-best team in the global competition and I was very proud of me and our team for the fabulous achievement."

    "Answer": "I didn’t exactly fall in the category of “quick & fast” during my high school days unless, of course, I was really good at doing something. So, when I was asked to “organize” our shoe store by my father with the help of his store staffs within just a couple of hours in order to free up some space for the new arriving shipments, I was less than enthusiastic. This cue card topic reminds me of this day and I thank you for the opportunity you have given me to talk about it.\n\nThe “fun” of moving the shoe boxes was on with me running almost at the speed of “Usain Bolt” (the Olympic champion sprinter from Jamaica) from one end of the store to the other. As if moving the big boxes, which probably weighed as much as me, if not more, weren’t difficult enough for me; I was faced with even a greater challenge of “pairing up” the lost shoes that were “running around” the store floor “pair-less”. Of course, putting back each and every pair of shoe boxes on the shoe racks in an organized manner along with swiping the floor wasn’t as much difficult as moving the large boxes and ‘pairing up’ the shoes, it was a challenge nonetheless. After all, back then, I wasn’t exactly a very strong boy with a strong “physique” to get the job done for my father!\n\nBut, defying all of my expectations and that of my father’s as well, I was actually successful to give a completely new look to our store at the end of two-hour long tireless efforts. And the final result was a tidy looking store interior with more than enough empty space, which looked to me as big as a “football stadium” at that time! Of course, the empty space didn’t remain “empty” for long as the new shipment containing the new shoe boxes arrived shortly after I had finished looking at my “accomplishments” in wonder.\n\nAnyway, after that very demanding couple of hours, I often took the liberty to visit our shoe store and “push” (to put it mildly) the store staffs so that they would think at least hundred times before making the store look “untidy” again! And guess what, the results of that “little push” was simply astonishing, to say the least, as I never found the store to be “unkempt” again!"

I must thank you first for the time you have allowed me to talk about it. \n\nMy physics lab was supposed to start at 11.30 am but I could not make it to the lab until 12.15 pm. When I reached the lab and asked for the teacher's permission to join the class, the teacher pointed out his wristwatch to remind me that I was already late. He then told me that all other students in the lab are taking a class test and the mark would be added to our final score! He also mentioned that I will not be allowed any extra time and the test will end at 1.00 pm.\n\nFrankly speaking, I was shocked that the teacher had decided to take an exam on the very day I was late! However, I was determined to take part in it and finish the test before 1.00 pm. Personally, I think that it was a really difficult task especially because I learned about the experiment the week before and did not get the opportunity to examine it myself. And it was even more challenging since I had only around 40 minutes left to complete it. \n\nI had to think and act really fast. The first thing I needed to do was to take the tools from the lab assistant and then concentrate on the question. I thought about the experiment the teacher showed us a week ago and the harder I tied, more difficult it seemed! I took a deep breath and started working on the \"test\". \n\nMy task was to find the value of \"v\" for different values of \"u\" in case of a concave mirror and to find the focal length. I quickly mounted the concave mirror in the mirror holder, moved the mirror forward and backwards to get a sharp image of the object on the wall. I needed to measure the rough focal length of the mirror and then followed several other steps to get the results of the experiments. I did not even notice the time and when the teacher declared that the time was up, I handed over my answer sheet to him. \n\nLuckily I managed to finish the experiment and wrote down my findings on the answer sheet. I did everything so swiftly that I could not be sure whether I did good or ruined the whole experiment! When the teacher returned my answer sheet the next week, I was excited to notice that I managed B+ on this quickly done lab exam which was in a way quite inspiring for me."

    "Answer": "This is an absolutely marvellous topic and I am fortunate to have been given the chance to talk about a foreign language, other than English, that I would love to learn.  \n\nI believe, learning a second language not only benefits our cognitive developments but also adds up our skills and helps us look at the world from a different perspective. Our skills in a foreign language offer enormous benefits for our personal growth and open up new possibilities. Additionally, multilingual ability expands our knowledge beyond borders and provides meaningful access to the understanding of other cultures and thus makes us tolerable to other people and their culture. \n\nTherefore, I would love to learn Spanish, a spectacular language that stands high in my must-learn list due to its wide range of application and beautiful and rich culture. Spanish is not only one of the most spoken languages in the world but also one of the richest languages ever. I had been briefly introduced to this language in my childhood by one of my uncles but that was it, and I did not get any further opportunity to learn it. Now that I have the freedom to learn a language or to enhance my skill set, I will definitely give it a try.    \n\nSpanish is spoken in most of the countries in South and Central America and in the US; with over 400 million global speakers of Spanish as their first language and millions more as a second language, this is an official language in many international organizations. It is the official language of 21 countries, including Spain. Besides, Spanish is the official or co-language in Spain, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n\nI believe, knowing Spanish will be a great opportunity for me to learn about the cultural aspects and rich history associated with this language. It will develop my sense of appreciation for Hispanic culture as well as transform my travel experience. Who knows when I'd bump into some Spanish friends on my next travel! \n\nI was told by my uncle and two other language teachers at school that Spanish is comparatively easier to learn for people who know English - thanks to its phonetic pronunciation and its similarity with English, in terms of vocabulary. However, I believe that without steady commitment and self-discipline, being able to speak Spanish would be a far-fetched idea. Therefore, in order to meet my goal and not to get demotivated along the way, I would have to find a teacher and one or two learning partners and we would fight this \"tough war\" together! Thanks to the development of the internet and I will definitely seek help from online resources to accelerate my Spanish learning process."

    "Answer": "I have always felt the need of learning another language, other than English, as it always helps to learn an extra language in order to succeed professionally in a world which is very competitive and tough. And I realized it in a hard way after coming to work as a Doctor in Saudi Arabia as I had no other choices but to learn the Arabic language if I was really to succeed in my profession.\n\nAnyway, learning the Arabic language should be a priority for every professional as it is spoken by almost 420 million people in the entire middle east and the Arab world, including a significant part of the African continent, which makes it the 6th most spoken language in the world. But, after starting learning the language, I immediately realized that learning Arabic was not easy for an Indian like me mainly I never needed to undertake an Arabic class in my country. Besides, Arabic mostly is a “pronounce-based” language rather than “alphabetic” language. In other words, if you don’t pronounce a word properly, the meaning of a sentence changes completely. Besides, most people don’t use vowels when writing Arabic which makes it really difficult for a foreigner like me with no prior knowledge of the language. Then there are also issues of “diacritics” (marks, points or signs) without the proper use of which, the same word can have up 5 meanings in Arabic. There are a number of other issues like this which makes learning Arabic rather difficult.\n\nAnyway, I like to learn this great language mainly because it would allow me to understand my patients better and thus serve them more efficiently as a Doctor. Besides, learning the language of another country would allow me to interact and communicate with the locals in a more proper manner by having a better understanding of what they appreciate and what they don’t appreciate culturally and traditionally. Finally, if I am able to converse in Arabic, the locals would possibly think of me as their own which would certainly make my life bit easier and happier."

    "Answer": "Having born and raised in one of the New York suburbs at the house of a dentist father in 1984, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg made his mark at an elementary school by getting interested in computer programming. But, little did anybody know at that time that the little “computer whiz” would revolutionize the concept of social media networking by creating a thing called “facebook.com” in 2004. Whatever followed after that is just 'history'.\n\nI would like to thank you for this nice topic and in my opinion, Zuckerberg is one of the most prolific and successful programmers and entrepreneurs ever, and I admire him so much. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg became so famous that Time Magazine declared this American technology entrepreneur and philanthropist as ‘person of the year” in 2010.\n\nHaving managed to connect more than 1 billion people among themselves one way or another, today, the social media “Mughal” has every right to claim his place in history as the “greatest web entrepreneur” of all time, some would say. Living in a house of more than 5000 square feet, with a price tag of about $7.3 million, in a town called Palo Alto, California, Mark Zuckerberg became the youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of more than $65.4 billion today.\n\nAdmiring a person for offering the world a new horizon of virtual reality by inventing a thing called “Facebook” in order to turn this world into a small place is easy. I could also easily admire his clear way of thinking which motivated him to wear the same T-shirt every day so that he didn’t have to waste his time in deciding small things such as what to wear, or what to eat for breakfast every day. But what I admire the most about this person is his risk-taking abilities (dropping out from Harvard University or turning down very lucrative offers from companies like Microsoft and AOL, just to name a few) and innovative ideas with a clear sense of vision in his mind so that he could finally deliver something really, really amazing to this world.  \n\nFinally, one couldn’t help admiring a “philanthropist” like Mark Zuckerberg, who is already a living legend in his mid 30’s, when he decided to donate at least 50% of his business shares- worth about $65 billion now – to promote equality and human development in the world. Now, how many people can do that!"

    "Answer": "We all have our favourite personalities whom we respect and love from the bottom of our heart. While some of them are friends and family whom we meet almost every single day, a few of them are great sportsmen or famous silver screen stars whom we have never met. Our admiration for a famous person makes us follow him/her and it's a dream for many to meet a well-known celebrity. Interestingly, I have a list of my favourite personalities from different arenas whom I follow on social networking platforms and I admire them for their talents, skills, contributions, philanthropic activities, and success stories. \n\nOne such famous person whom I greatly admire is Lionel Messi, one of the greatest football players of all time. He is a well-respected sportsman whom I have been following in news and Twitter for more than eight years. I scarcely miss a football match in which he plays. He is a wonder-boy in football and the favourite sportsman of millions of football fans around the world. \n\nMessi is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward both for the Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Messi has won five Ballon d'Or awards, two FIFA Club World Cup golden ball, a record five European Golden Shoes, nine La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League titles, six Copas del Rey and he holds many other records and success stories. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds many enviable records in the professional football. He has scored over 680 senior career goals for his club and country. Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by many as one of the greatest players of all time, he is world renowned and inspiration to many aspiring football players. Messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer and he currently lives in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. \n\nMessi has earned my deep admiration primarily for his amiable character, and formidable skills. Besides, he is the best football player alive and I really enjoy his performance and skills. Throughout his career, he has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). One of the highest paid sportsmen of all time, he is a legend in football history and deserved our respect and admiration. I admire him more than any other football player I know about."

    "Answer": "People say that nothing succeeds like success. So, we like to talk about it, whether it is ours or achieved by others, whenever an opportunity is presented. Today, I would like to talk about such success which surely would make anybody proud. This success belonged to one of my friends. \n\nMy friend, Travers, was an aspiring entrepreneur, and he wanted to establish himself as a successful entrepreneur since his early days as an adult. So, he decided to enter into the business of making garments products such as shirts and pants for the adults. But, the problem was that he neither had any prior working experience in that particular business sector, nor he received any formal training in the trade. So, it wasn’t exactly easy for my friend to get the entrepreneurial start that he expected. \n\nBut, he was a very determined lad, and he was not exactly ready to give up so easily. So, he decided to take a job at one of the garments factories with a very minimal wage in order to make him familiar with some of the tricks of running a garments business. It wasn’t an easy job to do since it involved long hours of manual works from unloading shipments to cuttings and sizing of hundreds of fabric pieces. He continued his back-breaking works there for almost a year, learning the nitty-gritty details of the business. Finally, he was ready- he was ready to set up his own business. \n\nA few sewing machines and a few skilled technicians were all he needed to start his business. In the beginning, it was only a few orders from here and there with nothing consistent just to keep him going in his works with a very minimal profit. But, as time progressed, my friend would get out for collecting work orders from different businesses, all over the country, in order to make customized dresses for them. I guess it was during this crucial period of time, my friend sensed that something good was going. My friend finally got what he wanted after working tirelessly for almost two years. \n\nI am really proud of my friend for what he achieved and how he achieved it. It was because of his hard works and sheer determination that he managed to become a successful entrepreneur at such an early age. In fact, there was tremendous pressure from his family to get a good job (since he graduated from university with good grades) instead of starting a business, but he didn’t succumb to the pressure and chose to carry on with his entrepreneurial pursuit even if it meant working for 16 hours a day and 30 days a month. I am also very proud of my friend because he was working for a greater purpose which was to create better working opportunities for the unemployed young adults, and I must say that he succeeded in achieving his goal to a large extent."

    "Answer": "People say that the secret of success is to do the common thing uncommonly well, but seldom people understand that it takes a lot of times and efforts to be successful. However, it holds even truer when a woman raises her “flag of success” in this world because, after all, it is not really easy for a woman to be successful whether it is academically or professionally.\n\nBut, my friend, Rebecca Lin, made “success” look really easy as she was only one of the two students in her 50 years of university history who managed to receive “Presidential Award” for her extraordinary academic records throughout her entire university years. But, did that success really come that easily? The answer is “no” because she had to go through a lot of hardship and sufferings during her university years. For example, she fell sick with Para-typhoid for more than three months during which period she seldom attended any classes. To make it even worse, at one point, her father (the only person in her family who was earning for the entire family, and they were a poor family also ) lost his job, and as a result, Rebecca had to work two shifts (16 hours) in order to support her family financially as well as attending university classes. Besides, she had to travel at least 3 hours a day in order to commute back and forth from her residence to school every day. Now, achieving such a great academic result after weathering so many difficulties was truly remarkable even for a man, let alone a woman.    \n\nI am truly proud of my friend “Rebecca” not because she is my friend but because she is a woman, and as a woman myself, I am not too sure that I could ever achieve such a feat even under the best of the circumstances. Besides, she managed to fare so extraordinarily in a subject (she was studying “Chemical Engineering”) which was very difficult to study for a woman as she needed to spend a lot of hours in a lab."

    "Answer": "Trying to learn a new skill can be rewarding as well as frustrating, depending on what kind of skill it is, and what we want to use it for. While we can learn some of the skills easily within a short period of time, we can’t say the same for the others which can take a considerably longer period of time to learn. Please allow me to talk about such a skill that can surely test our patience to the max. I am talking about how to learn using a computer at home, a skill that certainly can prove out to be useful in our daily lives.\n\nI think that many of us know how we feel when we are asked to write a certain letter or application for our works/schools on our computer, and we just don’t know how to even launch the writing software. We also know how frustrated we get when we can’t even do some simple math on an excel sheet, let alone troubleshooting the PC, turning on a webcam for the purpose of doing a video chat with a close friend who is living in a different country or making a PowerPoint presentation. But, unfortunately, getting frustrated doesn’t exactly solve our problems, learning and mastering the skill does.\n\nLearning how to use a computer can be a time-consuming matter since it involves a lot of things; starting from how to find the right computer application on a desktop to typing on a computer keyboard to understanding the issues of a blue screen and internet connectivity problems, learning them requires a great level of attention and enthusiasm. Besides, there are so many other things that can go wrong with a computer which even an expert struggles to understand sometimes.\n\nAnyway, we can try to learn how to use a computer in the best way from our friends/family members who know about computers. But, if you are not really that much into “divulging your weaknesses’ to others, then it is better to buy a good book that explains things in easy terms for your understanding. However, sometimes, neither a good book nor our friends/family members are enough, in spite of their best efforts and supports, to turn us into skilled computer users. And, should that be the case, we may want to join a computer training centre that specializes in teaching not only the computer basics but also the more advanced stuff. \n\nIt might take a while to learn a particular computer software but becoming a skilled and advanced computer user takes years."

    "Answer": "I am not really much into complaining unless I really, really have to. But, then, there come some situations when you have to complain because if you don’t, nobody will. It is like complaining in the public interest, I suppose. Anyway, the last time, I complained, it was about 3 years ago when I stayed at a hotel, and I wasn’t really happy with some of the services it provided. In particular, the issues were about “unwashed” bedsheets and “irregular” house-keeping. \n\nHowever, I formally complained about the issues to the General Manager of the hotel as the issues were bad enough for me, but they were even worse for a couple of sick and elderly people. In fact, they were having breathing problem due to some “damp” smell and dust mites which must have been caused by not cleaning the rooms on a regular basis. On top of that, if you have to sleep on some “unwashed” bedsheets and blankets, becoming even sicker is the only logical conclusion.  \n\nAnyway, after the complaint was made, the manager seemed to get really busy with his hotel crews and staffs. The manager even apologized to me, saying that he had been just too busy with some other “priorities” lately, and as a result, things had become a bit “rusty” at the hotel, much to the discomfort of its guests. However, in the end, the “hygiene” issue of the hotel was solved after my complaint, which, of course, was a good thing in the end.\n\nBut, what I just couldn’t get out of my mind was that how possibly a hotel manager could have some other “priorities” except ensuring the best services for his guests! In fact, I felt like the well-being of his hotel guests was the last thing on his mind. Besides, I also felt like I was simply being “ripped off” for the services, I was provided by the hotel, which was way, way below the standards. However, the only good feeling I had, in the end, was that a problem was actually solved because of my initiative which had made at least a couple of elderly sick people happy and relieved."

    "Answer": "I take a great deal of interest in the climate change that has been affecting our planet for centuries. So, whenever there is a talk or lecture on climate change, I seldom miss it whether it is discussed in a seminar or broadcast on the National Geographic channel. So, when I came to know about such a lecture on “global warming” to be addressed by one of the most notable NASA scientists, I was quite excited. The lecture was broadcast about 2 years ago on the National Geographic TV channel.  \n\nThe lecture methodically tried to highlight the damages on our earth caused by global warming and climate change. The very learned and distinguished lecturer presented the effects of greenhouse gases while saying how the Antarctic and the Greenland ice sheets were melting, sea level was rising around the world, as well as how the wildlife was on the verge of becoming extinct because of an extreme weather pattern. Before ending his lecture, the distinguished scientist didn’t forget to warn us as to how the future/fate of our planet hung on the balance if we didn’t take immediate measures to slow the global warming caused by us greedy humans. Indicating the extreme weather events such as El Nino, the lecturer also reminded us how the changes that had historically taken thousands of years to occur were happening in the course of decades.\n\nThe lecture was becoming more and more interesting as it continued for almost 2 hours, presenting the facts and information on how we humans have gradually destroyed our planet because of our unabated greed to power our modern lives. In fact, the lecture was quite worrisome for a native of a small island nation like me which, according to the lecture, would submerge in the ocean because of the rise in the sea level by 2050. In fact, the threat of global warming is so real that even the former US vice president travelled from one corner of the world to another in order to raise awareness about its negative impact. After following the lecture the entire time, I didn’t have even a shadow of doubt in my mind that climate change was and still is the biggest challenge to the existence of our planet."

But, then again, a country as huge, unique and diverse as China, with more than 4000 years of recorded history, certainly deserves to be re-discovered again and again. For now, we will just talk about an interesting part of my country (instead of the whole country) just to see what it has in store for us and the rest of the world. The name of this place is “Chengdu” (the capital city of the Sichuan province) which is located in the southwest part of China.\n\nChengdu is a very interesting place because of its many cultural, natural and historical sites in and around the city. In fact, west Chengdu offers some of the most beautiful and breathtaking natural sceneries in China. If someone wants to see some crystal-clear lakes, waterfalls, colourful ponds, small canyons and mountains covered with snow, Chengdu is the place to go. Chengdu is also home to many “Tibetan” people. In fact, as soon as you step into this great city, consider that you have started your journey into the “mysterious world of Tibet”.   \n\nHowever, apart from being an interesting place, Chengdu is one of the most, if not the most, famous place in the world for a very special and unique reason. Can you guess why? Well, the place is so famous because it is home to one of the most beautiful and cute creatures under the sky called “Pandas”. In fact, this is the number one reason for which tourists from all over the world visit “Chengdu”. The lovely giant pandas and panda cubs there are just so adorable that you will actually want to work there as a “panda keeper”. And guess what, you can actually become one! This place is also very famous for its delicious “Sichuan dishes” like “Kung Pao Chicken” and Hotpot which can be really, really spicy and hot!\n\nFinally, this place is also a famous place because if you remember “Po” in movie “Kung Fu Panda 2”, then you should also remember how the big, chubby, squishy and cuddly panda “Po” visited Chengdu (his home town) to learn more about his ancestors and family history! Pretty neat, isn’t it!"

Then again, there are just so many depressing and negative news ruling the world of today’s media, be it on the internet, TV or newspapers, it is just hard to disagree except, of course, there is news of different “kind” which is full of life and positivity. Today, I will talk about such a piece of news that I read on the internet about a couple of months ago at my work while doing some work-related research. The news was about how a group of generous grocery business owners in my hometown decided to donate at least 50% of their profits to the poor and needy people in our town for whole one month every year.\n\nI read the news and more details about it on a local news portal and it would be almost three or four months ago.\n\nI took the news as a very positive development in the attitude of our business owners who, up until then, were not very famous for their ”generosity”.  I knew that it was good for average citizens who were struggling to keep up with the increasing inflation in their daily lives. In fact, after reading the news, I decided to find out more about it and then spread it among my friends and relatives.  Later on, I, along with some of my friends, took some initiatives to convince other business owners as well, who were involved with other kinds of businesses except grocery, to do the same. Besides, I also wrote to the local tax authority in order to offer such business owners a good “tax break” for their magnanimity.\n\nAnyway, after reading the news, my first reaction was to give them a big “thank you” immediately for displaying such a nice “gesture” of help toward the less privileged section of our society. In fact, I became a bit emotional as well because of such a great act of benevolence which surely would help many struggling families in my town to make their ends meet. But, above all, I was actually very proud of our fellow business community who showed the way to share with each other at a time of our needs."

    "Answer": "To me, travelling is always fun whether I am travelling with young people or “not-so” young people. All we need to do is to plan properly and execute them to perfection. However, if you are travelling with an elderly person who is a little sick, things can become a bit tricky. Let me describe a time when I travelled with one of my paternal grandfathers (my grandfather had two brothers) to treat his age-related illness about a few years ago. We were travelling on a non-stop train. The destination was one of the best hospitals in the capital city of my country which was about 300 kilometres away from my home town. So far, so good!\n\nHow I felt about travelling with my old grandfather? Well, let’s just say, it was not easy.  In fact, it wasn’t exactly supposed to be easy when an old man in his late 70’s behaved like a 7-year old more often than not. In fact, it was a challenge for me to prevent him from falling at times when my old grandfather, very much young at heart, would decide to walk inside a moving train, simply because he was getting “bored” of sitting on his chair after every thirty minutes or so. On top of that, the concern on whether he was getting medicines on time was always ready to ‘alert’ me in case if I was becoming a bit too “relaxed” with my duties to keep my grandfather “alive and well”. However, one of the most remarkable feelings which I went through while travelling with my grandfather, was that I felt like I was “limited” in my power as if I could do things, whatever they may be, only if they were “not harming” my elderly and ill grandfather.\n\nBut, the moments of laugh were there as well when my “funny” grandfather chose to make jokes about his good old days at schools. In fact, it was quite refreshing and amusing for me to learn the “secrets” on how my “naughty” grandfather would “skip” his schools to watch football matches by riding on his semi-broken bicycle, only to find it completely broken in the middle of nowhere.  However, the best moment of our travel arrived when my grandfather called me his best grandson, reminding me once again about probably the most natural, durable and loving bond between a grandfather and grandson."

    "Answer": "The feeling that “you are short on time” can be very frustrating, especially, in situations when you are about to finish something important – something which you have prepared for a long time, only, of course, to find out at the end that it wasn’t just enough to get what you wanted. Let me describe such a situation which took place about 2 years ago at my work.\n\nBack then, I had just joined as a junior executive at a local company right after finishing my studies at university, and having spent only about 6 months there, I was in search for a better role and greater challenge. Suddenly, one day, as if God heard my wishes, my senior manager called me and asked me if I was interested in the position of a senior executive in another department. I responded “yes” without thinking for a second.\n\nHowever, the “catch” was I needed to give a PowerPoint presentation in front of all the Senior Managers of my company, and I had only about 20 minutes to impress them. I was also told that it was going to be a tough presentation as the managers had the discretion to ask me any question while I was standing in front of them and delivering my talks. The presentation was scheduled to be held the following week. So, I started to prepare myself without wasting any time.\n\nFinally, the day arrived, and I was fully ready to stand in front of my managers and deliver, or so at least I thought. I already had prepared the presentation materials as per the instruction, and the first 10 minutes was pretty much a smooth-going.\n\nHowever, suddenly after that, I was asked to explain a very important aspect of our company strategies which, I thought, I didn’t know very well. I was about to panic, but then I ‘ordered’ myself not to panic at all. I tried my best to explain the strategy in as precise terms as possible without wasting too much time on it as I need to cover the rest of the presentation materials within the stipulated period of time. As I was nearing the end of the stipulated time, I realized that I just wouldn’t be able to finish my presentation on time. It was ‘panic time’ again. But then, I told myself not to worry too much about it as there was always a “next time” in life. So, instead of going details on them, I simply chose to talk about the most important points by remaining very confident.  In fact, I just told to myself that there was nothing to be lost in life except a new executive role at a local company.   \n\nFinally, I did manage to finish my presentation but, needless to say, I wasn’t exactly very “thrilled and excited” about it since I couldn’t really cover all the presentation materials due to the lack of time. But, I was happy that I made an honest effort by having great confidence in my abilities. And that’s exactly what probably mattered the most in the end, as far as my senior managers were concerned, since after a couple of days, I was promoted to a senior executive position in another department."

    "Answer": "Bangladesh, apart from being home to the largest mangrove forest in the world, is also a land of many other kinds of trees, making it one of the greenest and beautiful countries in the world at the same time. However, today we will pick only one of those many different kinds of trees and talk about it. The common name of this tree, I am about to talk, is “Date palm”, and its scientific name is Phoenix Dactylifera. However, in Bengali language, it is called “Khejur” tree.\n\nBeing a tree of the palm family, it grows pretty much all over Bangladesh whether we want to grow them in a field or our front yard. It can be anywhere between 15 feet to 60 feet tall, and its trunk is about 10 cubic feet thick at its bottom. Having leaves of about 5 to 6 feet long (depending on the size of the tree), its leaflets are thin and pointy, and can be about one to one-and-half feet long and 0.75 inch wide.\n\nThe date palm tree is an important tree mainly because of its juice and syrup which is just loved by everybody in my country during the winter time. In fact, the livelihood of many people depends on this tree since they collect the juice of this tree use it to make “jiggery” (or “Gur”) in our local language which, in turn, is also used to make some really savoury and sweet dishes. Its trunks are also used to make furniture and timbers (suitable for structural uses) while its leaflets are also used to make beautiful baskets and mats. Besides, the fibre of date palm trees is used to make rope and packaging materials of real high qualities. Thus, the date palm has remained a tree of great economic value in my country for thousands of years."

    "Answer": "After reading so much about the “so-called” LDC (least developed countries), the “developing countries” and the “developed countries” during my high school years, I have always wondered and asked myself as to what possibly could have caused such “inequalities”. My “curiosity” turned into my “concern” when I entered the university as a student of Business Administration before almost 5 years. In fact, it was then that I decided to write a book on “man-made economic inequalities” after learning even more about it from the lecture of a notable economist in my country.\n\nI plan to finish writing the book in the next 2 years as my busy life schedules wouldn’t exactly allow me to finish it any sooner. Besides, I need to conduct a lot of research works and study to understand the difference between “man-made” causes and “natural” causes as far as economic inequality is concerned. The book will also include a comprehensive comparison between the economic eras before the industrial revolution, stretching back to the period of the European Renaissance, vice versa after the industrial revolution. Finally, and most importantly, the book will try to propose some practical solutions to the catastrophic economic inequalities in our world which are getting only worse by every passing day.\n\nI got motivated to write this book as I became really concerned about the ongoing economic exploitation of one group over the others in the disguise of a “crony” capitalism and free market economy. The world was supposed to be a better place with so many technological advancements and so-called economic growth, but, the situation is quite the opposite in reality. In fact, I became even more determined to write the book after learning that almost 800 million people of this world go to bed hungry every night while millions of tons of foods are getting wasted by the so-called rich and powerful every day. Besides, I have always wanted to help the poor and needy. So, if my book is a success story, I could surely donate the profits that I would have made from the sales of my book. So, just wish me luck!"

    "Answer": "We, the Canadians, love foods- and we love all kinds of them, whether they are palatable or “not-so” palatable, when we are hungry. But, then again, I am pretty sure that Canadian people, including me, don’t mind eating a particular kind of food on a special occasion or event whether we are celebrating just a birthday or “Canada Day” or just any other special occasions. And, the name of the food is “grilled spicy chicken wings”.\n\nNow, here comes the fun part of making our favourite spicy chicken wings. First, what we need to do is placing the wings in a large bowl. Then we apply dry seasonings with cayenne pepper, ground cumin and smoked paprika by rubbing them on the chicken wings evenly. Keep the wings refrigerated, soaked into sour yogurt for a better taste, for at least 30 minutes. But the longer it is kept and marinated, the better should it taste. After that, heat up the “properly greased” barbeque grill in medium heat. Once the grilled is heated nicely, we spread the wings on it and keep them for at least 15/20 minutes. Of course, we turn them occasionally to make sure that they are properly cooked, followed by brushing some nice and light dressing (either classic blue cheese dressing or Italian ranch dressing) on them. We can grill them for another 5 minutes until the wings are properly done while brushing frequently with more dressing of our choice. And, Voilà! Our favourite dish of spicy chicken wings is ready to be served!\n \nSo, why prefer our spicy hot grilled chicken wings on special occasions? Well, we prefer it primarily because it is easy to make with much less effort. Secondly, we are able to prepare it rather quickly. Thirdly, we can prepare the food outdoors in a large space which gives all of our friends and families an opportunity to chill and talk with each other while enjoying some good foods.\n\nFinally, Canada is a great country with many diverse people, having many different cultures and lifestyles. But, No matter how different, or far apart we are in our great country, we all seem to agree to be happily on board with a classic barbecue feast of juicy and spicy chicken wings, grilled to perfection, with crisp salads on the side!"

    "Answer": "Well, he was my nephew, and a young boy who was about 8 or 9 years old when I taught him something I thought was important to him. He was growing up and certainly wanted to do a lot of things in life, only to wake up to the “harsh” realities of life that things weren’t just as “easy” as he would have preferred. Still, of course, he just wished that he could actually learn to ride a bicycle on his own.\n\nSo, as a “well-wishing” uncle, I just “wished” for him all the lucks that I had in my “store”, but, unfortunately, it wasn’t just enough. He just kept running out of his luck, and I was also running out of my “patience”.  Therefore, I decided to “intervene”.\n\nFirst, I explained a few “tricks” about holding a bicycle properly, followed by a “universal art” of how not to “cry” after “falling” on the ground with a bicycle on top. Then, of course, came the part where I taught our “future cycling hero” how to paddle properly while maintaining the body balance at the same time. However, it was one of those situations where one would get to say “it is easy to say but difficult to do” kind of things, and my “struggling” nephew figured that out as well. So, despite my best efforts and “universally-accepted” cycling techniques, my good nephew kept failing and “falling”.  The “war” of keeping the cycle standstill on the ground, while paddling it, had continued for almost a week in this way with me, of course, occasionally “jumping” on it to display the “art and science” of riding a bicycle to encourage my nephew.\n\nFinally, my hard works as well as that of my nephew’s paid off, and my “student” was well on his way to grab a pack of cookies for me from one of the local shops by riding his bicycle without falling even once.\n\nWhen the “moment of success” finally had arrived, my nephew was just ecstatic as if he was flying on the moon with his bicycle. Needless to say, I was also very happy to see my nephew succeed. In fact, it was a great feeling to be able to teach someone to succeed in a difficult task and provide him/her with the much-needed confidence that one deserves. Besides, the very thought of my nephew, sharing his story of learning to ride a bicycle with his friends/family after he grows up, where I played an “important” role, was just gratifying and fulfilling. Finally, it was after this cycling lesson for my nephew, I realized how important it was for us adults to teach new things to our young ones because if we don’t, who else will!"

    "Answer": "I have always wanted to become my “own person” without ever worrying too much about becoming like “another person” when I was growing up as a child. Of course, I would never mind sharing some of their good qualities and characteristics if they really were to help me become a better person in life. So, from that point of views, if I ever wanted to become similar to another person, it had to be “Warrant Buffet”, often being referred to as the “Oracle of Omaha”. Some even like to call him the “Business Guru” while the others prefer to call him the “Investment Guru”.\n\nI never met Warren Buffett before, nor would he have the time to meet a growing young boy like me without any valid reasons. But, what I had learnt after reading so much about him on newspapers and journals, I was pretty sure that I already knew him way, way better than what could have been possible after meeting him in person for a few hours or even for a few months.\n\nI wanted to become like Warren Buffett because he had some qualities and attributes that had always inspired me as a young boy as well as a young man. Having learnt so much about him, who got into “money-making business” at an age of 6, by selling gum sticks in his neighborhood, and then becoming a billionaire at an age of 50 while still earning a humble $50,000 yearly salary from Berkshire Hathaway (a multinational holding company owned and operated by Warren Buffett), I was pretty certain that this “money making machine” was into “achieving” his wealth rather than “acquiring” them at any cost unlike many other businessmen around the world.  \n\nBesides, learning how this great businessman would use to wake up at around 4:30 am in the morning at a tender age of 13 in order to deliver the copies of the Washington Post newspaper, I just wished that I could become like a young Warrant Buffett so that I could also make some fortunes for myself. Finally, when I came to know during my university final year about 8 years ago that Warren Buffett, with a net worth of about $ 66 billion back then, had donated more than 25% of his wealth for charities while leaving only a tiny fraction for his children, I was pretty sure that the world could use a few more people like him.  \n\nOf course, the only problem was that people like Warren Buffett didn’t exactly come in “dime a dozen” kind of deals every once in a while. But, still, my young heart never really hesitated to expect to become a person like him when I was growing up to learn about the world of “money” around me."

    "Answer": "A piece of art I really like is a brilliant work by the world famous painter, Pablo Picasso, and the name of it is “Guernica (1937)”. I saw it for the first time at one of my country’s leading museums back in about ten years ago, but, I wasn’t exactly sure how to fully understand and appreciate the painting at that time. Then, as I started to take “Spanish” language class and started to learn a little about the history of Spain in the process, the famous painting started to present a much clearer picture to me.\n \nThe painting is about the “city of Guernica” which was bombed by the Nazi Germany planes during the Spanish civil war in 1937. The painting, in essence, has become to be a very famous symbol of anti-war indictment by depicting the horrors and tragedies of war in a perfect manner. In fact, “Guernica” is considered to be one of the Spanish Masterworks.\n\nApart from capturing a very historical event so nicely, what I really like about this painting is that it is full of many symbols, and yet, its main theme, which is about the sufferings of humans and animals alike, has been depicted very masterfully. Besides, the overwhelming size of the painting, which is about eleven feet tall and 25 feet wide, will make you feel like it wraps around you as if you are immersed into the action real life. Of course, it wouldn’t feel surreal, in my opinion, without the mastery of a perfect colour combination where a contrasting colour of black and white has been used on the surface of the painting in order to create some dramatic intensity.  \n\nFinally, the unique thing that I really like about this painting is the symbols, presented in this oil painting, are open for public interpretation. In other words, one will need to interpret the symbols as they deem fit in order to understand its “exclusive meaning”. But does it really have one other than the fact that painting is still very relevant today with wars still being fought around the world?"

    "Answer": "I am not exactly one of those people who like to plan things ahead of the schedule. But, when I do plan, which seems to be harder for me than doing the actual works, I want to make sure that I am able to execute my plans properly in order to “reap” the benefits of my “hard work”.\n\nBut, unfortunately, it was not the case when I planned for a camping trip with my cousins last time about 2 years ago in order to spend a night at a lake site. We knew exactly what we were up to. So, we prepared for everything by packing all the necessary things from sleeping bags, tents and outdoor cooking supplies to maps, compass, flashlights, extra clothing, lighters, candles and first aid kits. In fact, we had a perfect plan with everything under control except, of course, the weather. Well, we found out just before a day ahead of our scheduled trip that there would be a hailstorm with some heavy rains in the forecast the following day.\n\nSo, the new plan (or its lack thereof) was that we would remain indoors the whole day while watching some footballs and movies over some freshly-baked popcorns and cans of cold coca cola on the sides. And, if weather permitting, we possibly could enjoy some grilled barbeque as well.\n   \nWell, how I felt about the change? Let’s just say that the weather guy, who had forecasted about a bright and sunny day a week earlier on my TV, wouldn’t exactly be very pleased to know what I “called” him in his absence, only to realize at the end, of course, that the weather guy wasn’t exactly in control of the weather either. However, the worst part of changing the plan was that I was not allowed to enjoy our camping and a great outdoors near a beautiful lake while fishing in it with my cousins, courtesy to the “not-so” cooperative weather. Finally, unpacking my bags and luggage and putting the stuff back in the right places due to the change in the plan was also a bit irritating, to say the least.\n\nBut, other than that, I was pretty relaxed, consoling myself, that there always was the next time. So, instead of remaining disappointed, I decided to enjoy my time inside my house with my cousins while planning for our next camping trip except, of course, this time around, we didn’t want to rely on a weather guy for our weather information."

    "Answer": "My grandfather was a man of many “activities”- activities which were carried out for no specific reasons by a middle age man, or so at least I thought. But, as I grew little older as a child, I realized that the “activities” were really some important “house chores” which were very much needed in order to keep our family function effectively and efficiently. I also realized that my grandfather was a “bread earner” as well for my family together with my father. In fact, my grandfather was a school teacher.\n \nThere was every reason to believe that my grandfather loved his teaching profession as much as he loved (probably “caring” is the best word here) his young students. As far as I remember, my grandfather used to wake up very early in the morning every day for the purpose of getting ready to go to school with his bag full of books. A school bus would transport him to and from our house even though my father was very much in favour of dropping him at his work. I guess, he just loved his “freedom” of travelling on his own.\n\nHe would arrive at home at around 5:00 pm after finishing school works at 4:30 pm. He was a man of few words, but he would never forget to talk to us for a while before going to his little study room to prepare his lessons. I was pretty sure that my grandfather took his job very seriously as he would get little irritated if I ever entered his study room out of curiosity. By the way, his small study room was packed with many different kinds of books, and I only wondered how possibly he could have finished reading so many books all by himself! Later on, of course, I had come to know that my grandfather was a very good teacher. In fact, I was told by my father that my grandfather had received the “best teacher’ awards a few times.\n\nAfter his retirement, I found my grandfather to be still visiting his school to meet some of his fellow teachers which proved how much he really loved his school. Finally, I never saw my grandfather missing his school unless he was really very sick.\n \nWhen my grandfather died, I was only about 13 years old. But whatever I had learnt from him by that age was enough to understand that he really cared for his family, and he didn’t want to be a burden on his family members. And, as a result, he wouldn’t want to stop working as long as he could in spite of my father’s request to do so. Besides, my grandfather taught me how to help family even if it meant doing as little things as putting the glass back to its place. Then I also learnt from my grandfather how to be “serious” about my work/profession while also ensuring enough time for my family members. Finally, it was my grandfather who taught me that it is never too late to learn new things if it helped to become better at your profession."

    "Answer": "Sometimes in life, there comes a time when we just don’t know what we should do, or what decision we should make, when we are presented with a number of options to choose from. Should that be the case, we should always, in my opinion, rely on the wisdom and knowledge of others who are in a position to guide us in the right direction. Please allow me to share with you such an experience in which my older cousin helped me in making an important decision of my life.\n\nIt was after my A level graduation, I was struggling to decide whether I should have pursued a degree at a regular university in Business Administration, or I should be more focused on securing admission at an Engineering college. Given the benefits of having a better career option in attending an engineering college, I could have easily gone for an engineering degree. On the other hand, with a real possibility of receiving a very handsome scholarship option in pursuing a degree in Business Administration without leaving home, getting admission at a university wasn’t a bad option either. I needed to make a sound decision since the choice also involved staying with my parents or leaving them for a better “opportunity”.  But the problem was my parents left the decision up to me. Luckily, I had my cousin who almost always had acted as my “saviour” in the past, and this time was no exception. I decided to take admission to a regular university in Business Administration.\n\nMy cousin was about 10 years older than me, but I could always count on him because of his cool and calm head. Besides, he was an engineer himself. So, I knew that he would help me with some good advice. On top of that, my cousin would always take time in analyzing a situation before coming to a decision. And, knowing how much of a “well-wisher” he really was for me and my family, I and my parents knew that we were going to get a very “practical and right” decision from my cousin.\n\nFinally, my cousin had to struggle a lot in his life before establishing himself as a successful engineer as well as a businessman at the same time.  So, it was quite natural for me to value and admire him as a good “counsellor”."

    "Answer": "We buy things either because we need them, or we like them. Sometimes we buy things just because we think we might need them! But, just because we buy something, we need, it doesn’t necessarily mean that we use them much. Sometimes, we don’t even use them at all and leave them at a storeroom. One such thing, that I bought a few years ago, was a nice looking and expensive sound system, made by a very famous German company.  However, I scarcely used it ever.\n\nIt was a sound system which was really unique and special to me at the time of its purchase because of its many cool and advanced features. In fact, I bought the system after making very careful consideration of the coverage requirements for my rooms, the walls, the ceiling and the floors as so that the sound system could interact perfectly with its surroundings. Anyway, I bought the sound amplifier, of course, because I wanted to listen to some of my favourite soft rock and pop music in isolation from the crowds and noise of the “rest of the world”.\n\nHowever, after using it for the first few weeks in a random fashion after buying it, I didn’t exactly use my favourite sound system much anymore mainly because I just didn’t have enough time. Besides, changing and resetting the speaker system, every time you want to listen to a different genre of songs, can be a bit frustrating and time-consuming. On top of that, my family members didn’t exactly like the way I was enjoying my “free time” by listening to music in isolation from the rest of my family.\n\nFinally, I have a smartphone now in my hand which allows me to listen to my favourite songs with just a “click” of the buttons.  Anyway, just because I don’t use my speaker system much anymore, it doesn’t necessarily mean that I don’t like it anymore. In fact, I still like it just as the time when I bought it first, and I will keep it with me as long as I can!"

    "Answer": "Being residents of Quebec in Canada, we all love celebrating National Patriots' Day which falls on the Monday before May 25 coinciding with Victoria Day every year. Although it started rather recently from the year of 2003, we, in Quebec, celebrate National Patriots' Day (known as Journée nationale des patriotes) as a statutory holiday to honour the rebellion against the British rule that took place in 1837.\n\nNational Patriots' Day is a public holiday in Quebec when most businesses, government offices, banks, and stores remain closed.  All of us in Québec on this important day like to attend various celebrations and events while also taking part in historic activities that are organized throughout the province.  Celebrations may include marches, music concerts, public speeches, and award-giving ceremonies. Many societies, organizations, and community groups take special care to organize different events and activities that don’t only occur on this particular day but also before or after National Patriots' Day.  Special commemorative dinners may also be organized during this holiday.\n\nNational Patriots' Day is special in Quebec as it reminds us of our past struggle for freedom and liberty that we cherish so much in our lives. In fact, it is the rebellion of our forefathers on this day which helped bring democracy in our country. On this particular day, we become one nation in solidarity with each other in an effort to honour and remember the sacrifice of the Quebec rebels. Finally, this day gives us a great opportunity to get together with our families, friends and relatives over a special dinner meal which is just not possible otherwise most of the times."

    "Answer": "Being able to do something really well or being an expert in something, whether at work or study, is certainly a good thing. I already had figured that out during my college years, but I understand its value even more now at my work as a Junior Executive of my company when I frequently get called to participate in an interview process as a “psychological evaluation expert” on the prospective job candidate. Needless to say, being a “proxy psychological expert” isn’t exactly a part of my job responsibilities.\n\nYes, I get to check the “mental competency” of a prospective employee by asking them different questions during an interview. This is certainly not an easy task for a Junior Accounting Executive like me who has started his job only about six months ago. However, still, I somehow manage to pull it off by asking the right questions at the right moment. They are, of course, some random questions, but I seem to be able to ask the necessary complementary questions most of the times. Of course, I also have to work really hard to get my candidate open up to me so that he/she can feel free to talk to me about anything and everything to reveal his/her “potentials” as a prospective employee of our company. It is also a difficult process since it can take a while to fully understand and appreciate the “mental competency” of a job candidate.\n\nI accomplish the task better than others mainly because I can be really patient when it comes to listening to another person no matter how “inconsistent” he or she may sound. And, please trust me, listening to a prospective employee does help an interviewer to learn a great deal about him/her. In fact, I can listen to a person for hours without talking even once in response. I also like to observe people carefully which allows me an opportunity to create a “profile” of a particular person into my mind. I also feel like I do this task a bit better than others because I really make it easy for a candidate to freely express his/her opinions on something they really care.  Thus, I really feel that my ability to observe a candidate carefully along with the ability to engage him/her on a personal and professional level helps me accomplish the task better than others."

    "Answer": "Is learning the ‘history’ of the world important? The answer is “yes”. Then again, I used to always ask myself during my school years if remembering the facts about some dead people, who were only too busy in killing others at every opportunity, was worth the efforts and time. And I have asked the same questions again and again from my 6th grade to 10th grade keeping myself busy to learn the “history” of the world, only to find out that “History” subject wasn’t exactly “my cup of tea”. In fact, “History” was the most boring subject for me during my school years. There, I just said it!\n \nThe main reason, for which I didn’t exactly enjoy studying it, was because it involved a lot of memorization of some random dates while learning about some Christopher Columbus “discovering” the continent of North America, even though the native Americans/red Indians were living there already, didn’t exactly make much sense to me. Besides, learning how “Genghis Khan” killed millions to expand his empire wasn’t exactly something I was interested to learn during my school years. On top of that, the history class wasn’t really interactive with very little or no opportunity for active participation, which made it even more boring and tiring. Finally, the subject seemed to be really difficult for me as I never really got a good grade in it even after trying my best.\n\nAs a result, I did not study it much. While some of my classmates, who grew an affection to this subject, were up to reading \"history\" from many different sources, I invested a little time reading anything related to history outside my syllabus.\n\nHowever, as I am older now and beginning to learn about the world in an objective manner, I feel like learning history is imperative. In fact, the very reasons, for which I used to dislike “History” as a subject, seem to be rather interesting to me now. Learning history can be engaging, compelling and intriguing because, without it, we just won’t be able to learn our past in order to create a future that we would prefer.\n\nLearning history can be really fascinating as it helps us understand our world at present as the culmination of many, many events in the past. Besides, learning history can be really interesting as it acts as a storehouse of data and information on how people and societies behave. Finally, our world has gone through many fascinating changes in the past, and we don’t understand why those changes took place, it will be just mighty difficult for us to predict any event that is supposed to happen in the future. However, history also teaches us that we humans don’t exactly learn from history. What an irony!"

    "Answer": "I used to love listening to radio broadcast when I was still in high school. In fact, my little radio had remained a source of entertainment and news to me for a long period of time. But, as I grew little older and became little busier with life, the habit of sticking my ears with a radio just faded away.\n \nBut still, whenever I get an opportunity, I listen to one of my favourite radio programs, which is aired in “Bengali” language from “Radio Bangladesh” 106.5 FM. It is a weekly program on agricultural activities in the south-western part of Bangladesh.\n\nThe program is aired every week on Sundays, and I try to listen to it every week. I find the program really interesting as it broadcasts success stories of farmers from some unknown and isolated parts of Bangladesh where opportunities are just too limited. Especially interesting are the program episodes where it broadcasts the success stories of women in prawn farming which helps our country to grow and export very high-quality prawns to other countries. In fact, I just love the way how the radio commentator takes interviews of those honest and hard-working farmers who seem to be happy by getting an opportunity to just talk on the radio for a minute.\n\nBesides, I take a great interest in listening to this radio program because my family owns mango gardens, and the program does talk about mango farming from time to time. On top of that, the particular program also interests me because it discusses in great details about the prospect of Bangladesh becoming one of the most successful countries in the world in agricultural productions despite the fact that its agricultural land mass is declining at an alarming rate. Finally, I just love listening to this agricultural program because it takes me close to the life and domain which are free from the “hullabaloo” of city life."

    "Answer": "I only went there once, and it was a long time ago, but it made such an impression on me that I feel I can still visualise it really well. I went there to meet a writer, who is my cousin's brother-in-law. I am talking about a house that this writer owns where I have been to a few years ago only to find out an amazing house. I’m going to try and explain who the property belonged to, where it was, what it looked like inside and try and explain what it was that made such a strong impression on me.\n\nThe person who owns the property is a relative of my cousin Marrie and a writer by profession. So in a sense, he was my relative as well and I went there to record an interview with this writer.\n\nIt was in a remote area in Ireland. I interrupted my coach trip up the East Coast of Irland to get off at this remote town in far North Ireland. It wasn’t a usual tourist drop-off point, and I think I may even have had to request that the driver made a special stop at the settlement just for me. I stuck out like a sore thumb. I made my way to the only accommodation available, a sort of cheap motel.\n\nI hired a tour guide and I had no idea what to expect but clambered into the truck, and off we went, bouncing down rutted tracks, deeper and deeper into the village. I was a bit apprehensive about doing this.\n\nI sat and joined the guide and heard different local stories on our journey to the house. We reached there after three hours or so, I was amazed when I looked at a palace type house there. It was like a movie, not reality. It was extraordinary. The house was in the middle of a large area and I have never seen anything like this, or perhaps may have read in novels.\n\nThe house had a shell of interior walls that essentially served as a viewing platform for the dwellers. No phone, no TV, but home all the same. It blew my mind that you could make a home in such a way and in such a place. Also, although you might think the people there would be isolated, clearly not. In the evening more than 10 guests were invited.\n\nWhy is this a beautiful house? It is large, close to nature, does not have artificial architecture and offers more meaning to living there than the busy apartments. I absolutely loved it and wish to own one someday."

    "Answer": "No doubt, we are biased in our behaviour and attitude no matter how hard we try not to be. As a result, we tend to prefer someone or something while ignoring the others at our discretion. However, when we say that we like or prefer someone, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the persons, we like, are “better” than others, but it is just how we like to “feel” about a certain person or the others. And, the same also holds true when we say that someone is “beautiful” or “handsome” just as when I say that my maternal uncle is handsome.\n\nWell, he is my uncle - my most favourite uncle in that, so, he has to be “handsome”. I mean, how possibly a favourite uncle can’t be “handsome” to his nephew!? And, by the way, I know my uncle to be “handsome” and nice from the time I have come to recognize him from a very early age. He is a good looking person with a more than average height and strong, symmetrical features. But what makes his handsome to me is probably his confidence.  \n\nIn fact, there is hardly a day that goes by without meeting him or talking to him since he lives very close by my family. He is a doctor by profession, but he is also treated as a “leader” figure among his community members probably because of his abilities to help others during the time of crisis, his infallible confidence as well as because of his noble profession.\n\nSo, what exactly makes my uncle “handsome”? Well, I find him handsome simply because of the ways he “carries” himself around, as well as because of the ways, he presents himself to others while always having a positive attitude. Besides, if you see your uncle to remain nicely dressed and combed most of the times, he has to be “handsome”.  Isn’t it like that? But, if his nice attires and nicely-combed hair aren’t enough to make him look “handsome”, then his “soft words” and “smiley face”, while talking to others, should also make him a “handsome” person. Am I right? Well, if not, an uncle’s unending love and affection for his nephew and his family should certainly make the “most handsome” person in the world, and that’s exactly how much “handsome” my uncle really is!"

    "Answer": "It always helps if you are in good company, whether it is with a fellow student or a fellow worker, as it almost always makes your life a little easier. And, I am lucky that I have always found such good companies in my life as a student. Today, I would like to talk about one such person whom I have known for more than 3 years as one of my best friends at my university, and we both study in the same Major of Chemistry.\n\nAnyway, even though Timothy Chris and I know each other really well, we never really had a chance to work or study together, even though I know that we would make a great team together. So, the other day, when I told Timothy how we could benefit from each other by studying together, even though we may have different schedules, he gladly agreed with me. As a result, now we spend a great deal of time in our chemistry class studying in the same group as well as in the library, let alone spending countless of hours in the chemistry lab, doing experiments.\n   \nI would like to study with Timothy primarily because we go along really nicely, having a great understanding of each other. Besides, I am not really very good at “physical chemistry” since it involves a lot of math. In this kind of situation, Timothy can really help me since he is really good at math. I would also like to study with him because of his great helping attitude whether one is having a tough time understanding simple things or writing a thesis paper. On top of that, Timothy likes to talk about an array of issues, such as history and politics, just like me. Finally, Timothy is also in inter-university debate competition like me. So, I am pretty sure that if I study together with Timothy, it will not only benefit me with my university curriculum but also in extra-curricular activities."

    "Answer": "I like to visit different places whether they are close by or far away from me. In fact, sometimes, I just wish that I had a lot of money and time so that I could visit all the beautiful places all around the world. But one of the remote places, that I would really like to visit, is called Hornby Island in British Columbia, Canada. It is a Salish Sea Island, located near Vancouver Island's Comox Valley. While it is only about 185 kilometres from the city of Vancouver, but from where I live, which is Calgary, it is quite a far distance of about 1155 kilometres via Trans-Canada Highway.\n\nI would like to visit this beautiful small island next summer where a small community of about 1000 residents live. I am planning to drive to the city of Vancouver first, and then from there, I would need to travel by ferries, three ferries to be precise, which could actually take the better part of the day to reach the magical island of Hornby.\n\nI would like to visit this place mainly because I have heard so much about this place since I was growing up as a young boy. Somebody calls it the “Jewell of the gulf” while the others like to call it the “Hawaii of the North” since it has warm waters and sandy beaches.  And, yes, I just love warm waters and sandy beaches. \n\nI would also like to visit this place because it is an incredibly beautiful place with its simple, rural and relaxed atmosphere. Of course, needless to say, I also want to visit the island for its breath-taking views with its spectacular blue sky towering the blue ocean underneath. Finally, I have always wondered to see how an island with such a tiny population can survive and thrive while attracting several thousands of tourists every year!"

    "Answer": "Living in an environment full of air pollution, noise and hustling bustling of city life, I have always wanted to live in a secluded place close to a clear lake surrounded by trees, but certainly not too far away from the city centre. In other words, my dream home should be located in one of the quiet suburbs within a driving distance of the city so that I could have the best of both living in the city as well as the countryside. \n\nMy dream home should have two floors with balconies all around so that I could look over the trees and enjoy the natural beauty of outside. I don’t exactly prefer any “colour pollution”, so my dream home should be painted with light colour paints from both inside and outside in order to provide it a “sublime” look. I want my dream home to have a perfectly designed interior with a large space inside. The exterior of the home should have the design and look of a “bungalow”, but it won’t be exactly a bungalow. I also want to make sure the windows of my dream home are designed and placed in such a way so that the interior of my home receives enough lights and air from all directions all the times.  \n\nMy dream home should be a “modern day” residence with all kinds of facilities such as large bedrooms, a large guestroom complete with bathroom, storage, TV and mini-fridge, a large dining space, a large kitchen with personal pantry storage, laundry facilities and a small, nice computer lounge.  All of my washrooms should be equipped with bathtubs.\n\nIt would be a perfect dream home primarily this is the place where I would want to come back at the end of the day no matter where I am. My sweet home will be my perfect dream home because it will be built to offer me security and comfort like no other place in the world. I would call it my dream home also because this would be the place where I would be able to live with all of my family members in peace and harmony without being the subjects of unnecessary noise and disturbances. Finally, I would call it my perfect dream home because it would allow me an opportunity to interact with the mother nature in seclusion by sitting close to the lake."

    "Answer": "After eating home-cooked food for a long period of time, when you get an opportunity to eat your favourite dish at one of your favourite restaurants with your friends and relatives, you know that you are in luck to have a great time. The same happened to me when some of my friends invited me to eat one of my all-time favourite dishes at one of my favourite restaurants during the weekend, I knew that I was going to enjoy it all!\n\nIt was a very famous and busy restaurant called “Dandylion”, located in the city of Toronto, which was not very far away from where I lived at that time. Since it was a really busy food place, we needed to reserve for our seats well in advance in order to avoid the unnecessary waiting period. Anyway, finally the much-awaited weekend had arrived, and we were ready to enjoy our “weekend special” at \"Dandylion\" restaurant. We all ordered for our Sirloin Steaks and mashed potatoes with some fresh salads on the side.  While our main dishes were being prepared, I and my friends were busy eating the desserts which were some of the best in the town. Of course, our Sirloin steaks arrived while we were still busy with our desserts. So, it wasn’t really necessary to wait any longer, and we were busy putting the slices of our steaks into our mouths in no time. In fact, we were eating them like they were going “out of style” soon.\n\nAnyway, our meals were over, and we were pretty full in our stomach. But, we still felt like we wanted to eat them even more. We enjoyed the meal so much because the items were just cooked and prepared to perfection. In fact, I always enjoyed eating at that restaurant because of its “unique yet minimal decoration” with bare brick walls. Besides, it was a rare opportunity for our friends to get together on a weekend because we are just not able to make it any other time because of our busy life schedule. On top of that, the waiting staffs were really friendly to us. In fact, they treated us like their family members, which was quite refreshing. Finally, I really enjoyed the food because it allowed me an opportunity to “change my taste” as I was getting really tired of eating the same kind of “home-cooked” foods for a long!"

    "Answer": "I am not exactly one of those persons who find the “lost” things of other people randomly, simply because I never really like to pick up anything from any place under the sky unless, of course, it is laying at my own place. And, I had been practising this important “rule” of mine like a religion for as long as I could remember. I even loved “preaching” about my rule to others, only to have it “broken” by myself suddenly, one day. Even to this date, sometimes I just wish that I didn’t pick up that shopping bag, with a very expensive watch inside it, which was left by a lady sitting just next to me at a restaurant, eating her saucy spaghetti with macaroni and cheese on top.\n\nOf course, I could have just called her from behind when she was “leaving” the food place, but I chose not to, because, I assumed that she was only going to a “washroom” and that she would be soon back to pick her bag. But, she didn’t come back as long as I was present there, eating my food. I could have simply left it as it was, but I informed the restaurant manager. The manager told me that he wouldn’t to be any part of it and that I should have kept the bag with me since I was the first person to see her leaving the bag. I tried to convince the manager otherwise, but it was just a waste of my time and energy as he just wouldn’t “budge” even for a second.\n\nSo, anyway, I took the expensive watch in my possession and waited at the restaurant as long as I could, but the lady just never came back. I felt like it was my fault that the lady left her shopping bag since I could have stopped her, but assumed wrongly that she would be back, instead. However, after waiting for a little longer just before the closing of the restaurant, I decided to leave the food place after leaving my phone number and contact address to the manager.\n\nThe following day, the first thing I did was to inform the police about the incident, and the police gladly accepted the watch after handing over me a written document. The police assured me that he would call me if he needed any other information. Then I went back to the restaurant from where I picked up the bag to know if she ever contacted them or not. But the response was “no”.  Finally, I just told the manager that I had left the watch at the local police station to be picked up by its rightful owner. After that, I promised to myself that I would never pick up anything from anywhere unless it was mine and only mine."

    "Answer": "Do I like to study indoor or outdoor? Well, that depends on what I am studying, and how difficult is the reading materials. But, if I am asked to pick one, I would certainly go with “indoor”, which means either it has to be in a room or in a library. This time, I will go with a library – a public library that is.\n\nMy favourite public library is not really very far from where I live. Conveniently located at the centre of my home town, it is only about 10 minutes drive from my home if riding in a car. Being considered as one of the largest libraries in my country with a huge – I mean really “huge”- collection of books, you can pretty much read anything and everything there. But, for me, it is all about research works, as a post-graduate student, for my chemistry thesis paper. I go there to study mostly during the evening times since it is a lot less crowded during that period.\n\nI like to study in our public library mainly because I get to study a lot of materials there when I am really in a “mood”.  But, when I become a bit exhausted after studying chemistry and its formulas, I can easily read other kinds of materials whether it is a newspaper or journal. I can even watch some educational movies! I like to study there also because it offers a great research environment with almost no distraction to deal with. In fact, the library has a separate research corner for research students like us.\n\nFinally, I go to study there also because I become a bit more motivated and inspired after seeing so many students studying around me. So, I guess it is fair to say that my library is very much like a trusted study partner which is always there for me when I need it."

    "Answer": "History has always fascinated me. In fact, it is the honest and objective studies of history that teach us to understand how our world was in the past, how it is now, and how our world will look in the future in the greater scheme of things. But, does that mean that we don’t get to become little biased toward a certain part of the history because how it has changed our entire world for good? No, it sure doesn’t.\n\nIn fact, the world will probably never witness such a period of time that started with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austro-Hungarian Empire on 28th June 1914, and ended with the creation of a world body of an intergovernmental organization called “The UN” on October 24, 1945. There is no doubt that this particular period of time is of paramount importance in human history since it was after this turbulent period of time, full of wars and destruction, a “shadow” force, in my opinion, started to “manage” the affairs of the world from “behind the scene” by completely changing the world upside down.\n\nAnyway, history is a “tricky” subject, and learning it in “bits and pieces” here and there, without developing a comprehensive understanding of the whole picture, may prove out to be “counter-productive”. True that the world would never be the same after the World War II, but I have always wanted to know if the two world wars were the works of some “perfect planning so that a “new world order” would eventually come into force. I have also always wondered why the Europeans, after watching the devastating effects of the World War I, couldn’t manage to prevent the 2nd world war! Also, what possibly might have caused Germany to attack Russia after signing a non-aggression pact with Russia just shortly before the start of the 2nd world war! I have many more questions as to what really transpired during this particular period of time, but, perhaps I will never find the answers as it may lead to some really “uncomfortable and inconvenient truths”."

    "Answer": "Each person, young or old, is “unique” and “interesting” in his/her own rights since we all are different from each other in the ways we think, we talk, we feel and we behave. However, I try to avoid using the word “old” in isolation at all costs if it is not followed by some fine “adjectives” such as “interesting”, “intriguing” or “versatile”, since it could end up in meaning something derogative. Anyway, thank you for offering me the opportunity to talk about an interesting old person whom I met in a waiting room while waiting to catch my train at a railway station, about a year ago.\n\nHe was probably in his early 70’s. I didn’t really feel like talking to him or anybody, even though I was sitting very close to him because I was really exhausted after finishing a long and tiring day at work. All I needed was some quiet and relaxing time. But, unfortunately, that was not supposed to happen because I needed to go out in order to grab some snacks to please my “growling” stomach. I was very hungry. So, I requested the “aged” gentleman, sitting next to me, to watch my luggage just for a little while I was gone for buying something to eat. In response, he opened his little bag and offered me some cookies that were kept in it. I chose to oblige because I wasn’t really in a mood to talk or argue with anybody.\n\nEating cookies and thinking if I would make another attempt to go out because those cookies were just not enough for me, and just then he asked me for how long I was starving. I said “not more than 10 hours” in response. He smiled and then asked me again, “do you know how many people go to bed hungry every night?” I said that I had no idea. He said, “Almost 10% of the world population goes to bed hungry every night without knowing what they are going to eat the next day.” He also told me that he hardly ate more than twice a day, and his rather “thin” shape bears testimony to his “limited food consumption”. Suddenly, the train arrived, and we were ready to go. So, we just parted after greeting each other.\n\nThe conversation was brief, and I never really met that senior citizen before. But what was really interesting that I felt like he had some “authority” on me, and that I needed to listen to him even if I was not really in a mood to follow. In fact, up until I met that interesting senior gentleman, I had no idea that a person could be so passionate about learning the plights of other people in this world. But, the most fascinating thing about that “aged” person was he actually thought that he could make a difference in the world at his “not-so-young” age, and he surely proved it in his action by trying to feed a hungry person like me even though I didn’t ask for it."

    "Answer": "Life is full of many, many events. While we tend to forget most of these events, some of them do stick to our memories because of their profound meanings and values to us. Anyway, I would like to talk about one such event which, well, has helped me become the person I am today.\n\nIt was about 10 years ago, and I had just finished high school while still living with my parents in my home town. So, naturally, it was time for me to go to a university. But, I didn’t want to attend just “any” university as I had prepared myself, at least I thought so during that period of time, for attending the best business college in my country except, of course, I needed to pass a very hard and comprehensive university admission test before I could actually fulfil my dream. Anyway, as if passing a hard test wasn’t enough of a problem, when I took the test, I was actually suffering from some really bad cough and fever. So, naturally, I thought that I wasn’t going to pass the test. But, luckily, to the best surprise of my life, I did pass the admission test, and I did manage to attend the University of my dream, far away from my home town.\n \nThis event was memorable to me mainly because it was after this event I started to feel more confident, which I really lacked up until that point, about my life and its overall goals. Besides, it made me feel really happy and emotional because my years of hard works and efforts had finally paid off, even though none of my family members or friends believed that I could actually pass the test because of my illness. Finally, and probably very importantly also, it allowed me to explore my life and the world around me on my own, away from the comfort of staying at home with my parents, while studying at one of best universities in my country."

    "Answer": "I love watching TV, but not so much the advertisements it shows in the middle of some interesting programs, I enjoy. But, then sometimes, I come across some adverts that amuse me from time to time. I will talk about one such TV commercial today which I saw at my home a while ago.\n\nThis is a “car advertisement” where Mercedes Car is congratulating “BMW” Car company, the fierce competitor of Mercedes car, on its 100th anniversary with a very cheeky message that writes “Thanks for 100 years of competition. The previous 30 years were somewhat dull”.  The ad also displays the signature “kidney grille” symbol of BMW car, which is located at the front and in the middle of two front headlights, while also very cleverly ‘illuminating’ the message right below the signature “grille” in order to remind the BMW car company that Mercedes is a “senior campaigner” in the car manufacturing industry. The advertisement was displayed on a plain dark background the entire time with a contrasting white colour message in order to render to keep it as much simple as possible.\n\nI really, really like and remember this advertisement mainly because it is so simple with no background music or voice to draw the attention of its audience and keep them engaged. In fact, I put this commercial in the category of “telling many things without saying anything”. I also like this advertisement because of its “unique theme” where it shows that a particular company is very much able to promote its products while actually congratulating its competitors also at the same time in a very graceful, and yet, clever manner. Finally, I like this ad because Mercedes has managed to throw a “subtle’ challenge in “congratulatory” tone that BMW would never really be able to “outcompete” its senior competitor no matter how hard it tries."

    "Answer": "In my country, buying a car isn’t exactly a big deal, but driving a car is. It sounds a bit odd, doesn’t it? Well, if it does, then the reason for this is, it is extremely difficult to obtain a driving license in my country as it involves some rigorous driving and road test. So, when I finally managed to pass the driving test a year ago or so, I felt like, I had landed on the moon.\n\nBut, I didn’t really feel the same about driving a car until I ran into a job interview where I was asked whether I had a driving license or not, as the job involved driving to some “high-end” clients once in a while. However, I didn’t get that job for whatever reasons that might have been, but it was after that job interview, I decided to learn to drive a car. So, I went to a local car driving school and started to take driving lessons mostly during the weekend. Initially, the lessons involved learning about different parts of a car and their functions. Then came the actual driving lessons on the road by understanding and following different road signs and driving rules. Needless to say, the lessons followed some stringent driving standards which weren’t always easy to maintain, but that was exactly the real “test” in order to help a future driver understand the safety and security aspects of taking a car on the roads.  Anyway, the lessons had continued for almost three months, and I was finally ready to take an official driving test to obtain a driver’s license.\n\nAnyway, I am glad that I had finally learned driving as it has allowed me the freedom to travel to my work and other places at my own pace and according to my schedules. Besides, learning this driving skill has also made me confident about applying for some “good paying” field jobs that require “driving”. Finally, learning how to drive has also allowed me to transport many bulky items in my car, which otherwise would have been really inconvenient for me if I was to carry them in public transportations."

But, winning an “employee of the month” award at least at my work wouldn’t be such a bad thing after all, in my opinion.\n\nI haven’t started my current job for too long, but I already like some initiatives there to encourage its employees to perform well. One such initiative is giving awards to its best employees every month for hitting certain performance benchmarks. Of course, achieving these benchmarks is not really easy as they involve following certain difficult work guidelines which include finishing certain number of projects/tasks every day before closing of the workday without working any overtime, maintaining “zero” late attendance the entire month, collaborating with other departments for a certain number of hours every week, and not taking any day off unless there are very valid reasons and emergency situations.\n\nI want to win the prize mainly because I want to become a valuable and reliable staff of my company so that I am considered for a bigger role in my company. And, bigger role, of course, would most likely mean having better opportunity to learn something new and greater financial advantages. Besides, I want to win this prize also because it would help me boost my confidence so that I am able to grow, not only in my professional life but also in my personal life.

But that didn’t happen because I couldn’t simply make up my mind on the type of gift items which would make her happy even though I searched everywhere in all kinds of shops and markets. I even asked my niece to help me with some kinds of “clues” in order to make my “gift choosing” job easy, but my “plea” didn’t receive any sympathy from my “mischievous” niece. So, I just told my niece that I was going to postpone searching for her gift until her next birthday, and my niece gladly accepted my proposal.\n\nHowever, when her birthday actually arrived, I simply decided to offer my niece a “substantial” amount of money instead of some gift items mainly because I was really busy with my work and a few other urgent family matters, and I just didn’t have enough time to search for a perfect gift, like the last time I searched, even though, I really wanted to do it. Besides, she was kind enough that time around to tell me what kind of gift, she exactly liked, and where she would get it from. She also told me that she would rather choose her gift with her friends instead of having me to choose one for her (perhaps realizing the fact that I wasn’t probably very good at choosing a “gift”). So, when I asked to offer her the money (a rather “substantial” amount of money in that), needed to buy her ‘precious’ gift, she simply obliged.  And, guess what, it worked perfectly well for both of us at the end of the day!"

But, all that changed when I met little “Raisu” about a couple of years ago in my neighbourhood.\n\nI met the little 5 or 6 years old Raisu for the first time, if my memory serves me well, at one bright and sunny afternoon when he was struggling to fix the “chain” of his bicycle that he was riding. But, after noticing him struggling for a minute, I decided to offer him help to fix his two-wheel ride. Anyway, I had seen Raisu a number of times before, but never really felt inclined to have a chat with him until that moment when he thanked me with a very happy face after fixing his cycle. I asked him about what he was going to do if nobody was there to fix his ride. In response, he simply told me that he would keep trying again and again until it was fixed.   Next, when I asked him if he had any friends, he simply told me that he was not allowed to have any friends of his age (ordered by his parents) because he would always get into fights with them. Our conversation pretty much ended at that point, but before leaving, I asked Raisu if he remembered how to fix his chain. In response, with a big smile on his face again, he said that he didn’t remember.  \n\nI thought that the conversation with Raisu was really interesting because up until that conversation, I never knew that a child of that age could understand the virtue of trying again and again. It was also interesting because Raisu reminded me of sticking to the truth no matter how embarrassing it really was by revealing the truth to me about the reason for not having any friends. Finally, the conversation with Raisu taught me that it was ok to “forget” about things in life because life would go on one way or another."

It is a super classic novel, written by Harper Lee during 1960, that talks about the past American society in the 30’s of 20th century in a very realistic away, when racism was prevailing in every corner and every activity of the said society, even though everybody talked about how racism was wrong.  This classic book also describes how one man’s good intention is just not enough to make a difference in a town which is full of racism, and that sometimes it takes another generation (generation of character “Scout”) to break away from the cruel and rather limited way of thinking of the previous generation.\n\nThis book was a really interesting read primarily because, in my humble opinion, even though, it talks about serious issues like rape and racial inequality, it has done so by perfectly blending warmth and humour.\n\nI liked reading this great classic also because it very nicely tried to advocate a female “protagonist” character without defending her actions or inactions because of her gender. Besides, the pragmatic and easy-flowing conversation among different characters falls in the “realm of truthfulness and no pretence” is simply outstanding.  Another thing, which I found really interesting about this book, is that even though this is a classic novel, it doesn’t shy away from portraying the different phases of child growth in a very wonderful manner. Finally, I found this book fascinating also because even though this book was written a long time ago, it is still very relevant because racism, cruelty, prejudices and discrimination still shockingly exist today in many societies in the same ugly magnitude or perhaps in a more severe form."

Needless to say, I really liked the gift!\n\nA gift from my uncle was long overdue because my uncle wanted to surprise me with a gift of his choice as I managed to pass my undergraduate degree with really good grades a couple of years ago. But, I knew it very well that I would have to wait a long – I mean, a really long time - to get a “surprise” gift from my uncle, and I was so right about that because I had to wait a long one year! But it is better to be late than to be never as he did get buy me a nice gift.\n\nThe jacket was of a very attractive light yellow colour with a light navy blue stripe all over. The outer layer of the jacket was made from some tightly but very evenly-oven, high-quality synthetic materials with a hydrophobic coating in order to allow water vapour to pass out into the atmosphere, while also blocking outside moisture from getting in at the same time. The jacket, with thick fur inside, was my waist-length, and also had a high and round neck collar to cover the area between the mouth and neck completely.\n\nIt felt so good after getting such a nice gift from my “stingy” uncle that I thanked him immediately. The jacket fit me perfectly well as it had the perfect length and body measure. It was such a light jacket that I felt like I was wearing nothing while putting it on. Besides, I found the colour of my jacket to be unique because I can’t really remember seeing such colour on any clothing. Finally, of course, the jacket was really warm and comfortable to wear even during a very harsh winter."

    "Answer": "Different people like to collect different things for different reasons. While some people like to collect things to preserve memories, some others like to collect them just for the fun of it. However, my friend, Ronin Gomez, likes to collect things in order to “appreciate their beauty”, even if it sounds a bit unusual.\n\nIf my memory serves me well, Ronin has been collecting “watches” from his childhood for about last 15 years or so, and during this period, I have seldom seen him talking about any subject without any “footnotes” on his watch collection! But, I must say that my friend is really passionate about collecting different kinds of really beautiful and stylish watches from different eras and different countries even if it means travelling from one corner of the country to another with time permitting, of course. Besides, I should also mention that Ronin’s parents have been really supportive, financially or otherwise, of his “passion” for collecting watches without which, I don’t think that Ronin would be able to carry on with his “hobby”.\n\nIt’s not that Ronin just likes to collect those watches randomly and leave them here and there, but he likes to organize and store them inside a beautiful, glass-made “showcase” in the safest part of his home, away from “light” and public access, with serial numbers and other necessary information placed next to them, so that if they are ever stolen or lost, he can easily file a police report on them. And, then, of course, Ronin also makes sure that his beautiful collections are “polished” with distinguished and expensive “liquid cleaning materials” on a regular basis in order to preserve their shiny and unique looks.\n\nAnyway, my friend enjoys collecting watches because it introduces him to the “artworks” and “technological pursuits” of different countries and eras in a way which wouldn’t be possible to know otherwise. Besides, the hobby allows my friend a “bragging right” to his friends about his efforts and “accomplishments”. Finally, he enjoys collecting watches because it keeps him busy when there is nothing really important to do."

    "Answer": "I don’t really think that we would ever meet anybody who doesn’t like a person who is remarkably good at cooking. In fact, nothing brings a family closer to each other of its members than some delicious cuisines on the dining table, especially, when they are made by a “passionate and expert” cook, and today I would like to talk about one such cook.\n\nThe person, I would like to talk about today is none other than my aunt, whom I have known for more than the last 25 years - since the days I started to remember things, and who happens to be a frequent visitor to my family. Before meeting my aunt, I had no idea that a person could be so passionate about cooking and taking it to a level of “art” by spending so much of her time and efforts.\n\nIn fact, my aunt has been so much popular within her circle because of her great cooking expertise that she is frequently consulted by friends and foes alike on what kinds of food to be cooked at certain social functions and gatherings, or how to best cook them. Interestingly enough though, my aunt – we like to call her as “Roselyn”- never really attended any culinary schools or institute, and yet, she practically knows how to cook many different kinds of cuisines, be it Mexican, Italian, Chinese or Mediterranean, from across the continents in perfection to the delights of all kinds of food-lovers from all ages and culture.    \n\nAnyway, I think that Roselyn is really good at cooking because she makes “cooking” look absolutely easy, no matter what kinds of cuisines she cooks, and how many people she is cooking for. In fact, I have always found my aunt to remain in a really relaxed mood while cooking, and yet managing to prepare some surprisingly delicious foods at ease. I think that my aunt is very good at cooking also because she always likes to try new recipes – many of her own – and experiment with them by trying different combinations for hours until she is fully satisfied."

    "Answer": "People have ambitions, big or small, in their lives, and they all try to materialize them as best as possible in order to gain personally mostly. But, having ambitions for a noble purpose in order to make a difference in society is not something we always get to see unless we meet a young entrepreneur like “Rabbi Chaudhury”.\n\nI have known Rabbi, a great friend of mine, from my early high school days as a hard-working and brilliant person who has always preferred to think “out of the box” when trying to provide solutions to any problem, be it personal or professional. Being the child of a rich man in his small town, Rabbi has always had pretty much all the means at his disposal to enjoy a great life in a big city among many riches and luxuries after finishing his tertiary education and getting a steady job, and that’s exactly what his parents expected also. But, Rabbi didn’t exactly want to go that route, as he always hid an ambition in his mind to set up a small “garments” factory there. So, anyway, once my school friend finished his university education, he started to convince his parents to go along with his “ambitious plan”, but unfortunately, his parents kept protesting that idea vehemently as they didn’t want the talents of their child to a “complete waste”. However, Rabbi’s parents eventually gave in to the constant request of their beloved child.\n\nRabbi’s plan to set a garments factory in his little town was an important step to deal with the demographic changes effectively by encouraging young people to remain there, as the town was losing on its young population so that they don’t have to move out of the area to find steady jobs. Besides, it would create a great opportunity for the community members to interact with each other on a more personal level in a town which has remained rather divided for long along an “invisible” cultural and religious line. Finally, the plan would provide a general boost to the economy of the town."

    "Answer": "I think that we all know a person or two within our friend or family circle who doesn't like to stay at his or her home because he/she loves outdoor activities too much. Of course, the opposite could be true as well. But, today, I would like to talk about one such person, my cousin actually, who likes to enjoy outdoors in a rather unusual manner.\n\nVisiting the bedroom of John for the first time would give anybody the impression that it is a “mini weather lab” with all kinds of household weather measurement instruments, such as barometer (an instrument that measures the atmospheric pressure), hygrometer (a device that measures the humidity in the air) and “Rain Gauge” (a device that is used to measure the amount of rain) and other instruments, laying either on the floor or tables, or hanging on the walls. You will also find different kinds of weather charts, prepared by my self-declared “meteorologist” cousin, hanging on the walls. So, what all these have to do with the outdoor activities of John?  Well, the answer is, he likes to get out and check how the changes in the daily weather affect the trees, lakes, soil and grass, among other elements of mother nature. And to do so, he spends hours, walking/travelling to different natural sites, to come up with his own “hypothesis” as far as the effects of weather changes are concerned. So, how often does he take on these outdoor “activities”? Well, let’s just say that he is as “unpredictable” as the “weather” itself.\n\nI think that my cousin genuinely enjoys his outdoor activities because they allow him to interact with Mother Nature in different states at different times and seasons. Besides, these outdoor activities keep him rather busy on an intellectual level when there is nothing constructive to do. Finally, I think that he truly enjoys them because these activities allow him to contribute on the daily local newspapers from time to time in order to let others know about his own ideas on the changes of the climate as a whole."

    "Answer": "Up until recently, I have always felt that the nature of a workplace doesn’t necessarily affect the speed and spirit of a worker. But, I had to change my mind about it after visiting an “ideal” workplace of my friend the other day. Anyway, while the experience of visiting this extraordinary workplace of my friend was remarkable, I would like to describe my own “dream” workplace here.\n\nMy dream workplace would preferably be located nearby a lake and surrounded by trees. I would also like it to be at one of the top floors and, geographically close to everything except, of course, the unnecessary traffic congestion and noise. My office should also have two desks - one would be facing away from a large glass window (from where the lake is visible) so that I could interact with the people who come to visit me. The other desk, on which, I would have my computers, printers, and the other essentials, would be placed against a wall (or maybe even a corner of a small hallway) where the real work would get done.  A couch, of course, would face the lake, but rotate to face the flat-screen TV,  scratch that. The Couch faces the lake, and when I want to watch TV, the window is covered by a drop-down wall with the TV inside of it. I'd also have a bed so that I could stay the night comfortably when necessary. Other facilities at my dream workplace may also include a kitchen, a gym, and a large open space in which we could sing “karaoke”.\n\nAnyway, even though I am an “average” professional, I do dream that one day, I would be able to work in such a dream workplace, which I just described above. And, all I need to do for that is to convince my company about the benefits of having such a workplace. But, even if that opportunity is never arranged for me by others, I would certainly try my best to create one myself when I start my own business sometimes in the distant future."

    "Answer": "I have read and heard about many success stories of other people, and they made me feel really good and motivated. However, I am not sure if my success story here would make anybody feel good or motivated, but it is still worth giving a good try.\n\nBack in my university years, about 7 years ago, I developed a hobby of “gardening”. I became interested in this hobby also because I wanted to take part in a competition, organized by my own city government, in order to win the “best gardener” award of the year.  Of course, the problem was that gardening required a significant amount of time and efforts to become successful. Starting a new part-time job with good salary unexpectedly, shortly after starting gardening, didn’t help my cause either. But, I just didn’t want to give up on the idea of gardening because I already spent some good money and time in nurturing it.\n\nSo, I decided to work on better time management by cutting short on TV watching. Then, I also started to meet my friends a lot less in order to work extra time in gardening. By the way, my garden had at least 15 different kinds of plants, including paper-bark maple, ornamental cherry, Rowans and Japanese dogwood, which required some really good care. In this way, my gardening work had continued for the next one year or so when I was finally ready to take part in the competition. And, my “beautiful garden” didn’t disappoint me at all as it helped me achieve the 2nd best award in the “best gardener” competition.\n\nI felt really good after I received the award in the competition, as I wasn’t too sure about the success of my hard works. In fact, after the success, I was convinced that if we really work hard and be patient, the success would come on our way sooner or later. Finally, I also felt really happy and proud because of the fact that my little initiative and success would go a long way to make my city look more green and beautiful."

    "Answer": "Thank you for choosing this topic for me. I don’t really think that I found things in the past that were noteworthy. However, there was one occasion, when I found something valuable and noteworthy, which I would like to talk about here.\n\nIt was about a few years ago when I was visiting one of the busiest tourist resorts in my country with some of my friends. The visitors there usually remain in a very relaxed mood because they want to make the best use of their vacation time by enjoying as much as they can. The situation is pretty much the same all over the resort whether they are enjoying their time at a regular restaurant or spending a few nights at a luxury hotel. I, along with my friends, was also in the same frame of mind where the last thing, we were expecting, was to find some valuable items, left by some “careless” visitors.\n\nBut, that’s exactly what happened to me when we went to a hotel room. Anyway, everything was looking so clean and organized in the room.  But, when I was taking my shower in the bathroom, I noticed that my bathtub was not exactly emptying its water as fast as it was supposed to. So, I decided to take a look at the “drain” of the bathtub through which, the water was supposed to pass. There, I noticed something “metallic” which was blocking the “drain”. After taking a closer look, I made sure that the item was nothing but a “golden ring”. So, I immediately took it to the reception and informed the person in charge about the item.\n\nAnyway, after finding the item, I immediately wanted to return it to its rightful owner except, of course, I just didn’t know who he/she really was. I also wondered why the housekeeping people didn’t notice the ‘slow passage’ of water through the bathtub drain. Finally, I also felt that the owner of that ring must have left the room in a hurry before even noticing what he/she was exactly missing or leaving behind."

    "Answer": "The environment has become a very important issue lately for many people around the world as it has proved out to be affecting our life rather directly. In fact, I have seen many people in my country, who are being vocal about this problem, and Mr Rabada Qureshi seems to be one of them.\n\nI have known Mr Rabada, living in the same neighbourhood as me, for almost 10 years as a “social activist”. However, I met him for the first time about 7/8 years ago when I visited him for some medical check-up and treatment. By the way, he is a Medical Doctor by profession, and a good one in that also. I also knew that he had involved himself in eradicating some social problems, like drug addiction and violence against women, by writing extensively on them on a number of local and national daily newspapers. But, I came to know how deeply he really cared about our environment, only when I visited him for some medical check-up and treatment about a few years ago at his chamber, as he lectured me for a good 5 minute about the negative effects of smoking on our environment.\n\nBy the way, I used to smoke heavily back then which caused the coughing. Of course, I already knew a little about the environmental problem and climate change issues of our planet, but I didn’t realize how close those problems really were to our own homes until I met Mr Rabada on that day. In fact, after visiting the doctor gentleman on that day, I started to quit smoking gradually and following his informative articles on environmental degradation in our areas on local newspapers.\n\nAnyway, I think that Mr Rabada genuinely cares about environment because I have seldom seen him these days, using his private vehicle to travel to his chamber, as he doesn’t want to pollute the air by using fossil fuel. I also think that he cares about the environment because he always encourages his patients to plant more tree whenever and wherever it is possible."

    "Answer": "If reading without a “looking glass” for a person with eye problems is incomplete and inefficient, searching for important information in today’s world without using the internet has to be incomplete as well. And, I also figured it out when I was searching for some important information about a couple of years ago.\n\nI never really like to travel during the wintertime for two reasons. The first reason is, of course, I don’t enjoy cold weather that much. The second reason is that the winter causes the visibility of roads to become low due to foggy weather, and I am never really comfortable riding on a vehicle when the road visibility is low because it increases the possibility of an accident. But, I really needed to travel during the wintertime about a couple of years ago, because I wanted to see my younger sister, who had just given birth to a beautiful baby girl.\n\nAnyway, I could either travel by train or by bus, depending on how fast I wanted to reach my destination, as well as the “visibility” of the road due to the hazy weather condition. I tried to call both the bus authority and the train authority in order to get the necessary information, but, while they were able to tell me exactly how long it would take me to reach my destination, they couldn’t tell me anything specific about the “winter fog”. So, I decided to hit the internet to find the information on winter fogs of those places, through which my train or bus would pass, by checking the usual temperatures and humidity levels of those areas. Luckily, I learned what I needed to know after searching for about 20 minutes.\n\nAnyway, after finding the needed information, I felt really happy and relieved as I was able to find rather quickly, comparing with other sources of information, that the weather condition was not that bad for a daylong travelling. Besides, I also felt that I could rely on the internet more often in order to find important information for the purpose of meeting our daily informational needs."

    "Answer": "I don’t really like to go shopping unless I have a good reason to do so, because it usually takes longer than usual for me to do the shopping most of the times. However, here I would like to talk about a shopping place which rather encourages me to visit it once in a while.\n\nThe name of this shopping place is “Buy All You Can” which is located in the outskirt of my hometown.  It is more like a “supercenter” which opens at 6:00 am every morning and closes at 11:00 pm. I would say that it is easily one of the busiest shopping places in my town because I have seldom found a dull and quiet moment there, no matter what time I visit it.\n\nCovering an area of about 7000 square feet, with a large parking space in front of it, this shopping place draws all types of customers, not only from within the city but also from outside of the city, most of the times. Of course, these customers have a handful of reasons to visit this busy supercenter, but the main reason is that it sells a complete line of grocery products, including fruits, vegetables, dry foods, snacks, loaves of bread and cakes, fish, meat, dairy products, frozen food, kitchen and household appliances, and cleaning products, among many other items for our daily needs. This supercenter also has separate sections for “seasonal clothing items” and “beauty products”. One of the distinct features of this shopping place is that it sells both the “high-end” products as well as the products for “regular” customers. There are other reasons for visiting this great shopping place, but I visit it twice a month mostly to buy some fresh fish and vegetables.  \n\nAnyway, this is my favourite shopping place because I can find and buy the products, I want, rather easily and quickly without asking the store crews there. Besides, I also like to visit this big store because it promotes the products of “serious small businesses” as opposed to just selling the merchandises of only big and profit-making companies."

    "Answer": "I have always considered the opportunity to work in a different country as a rare privilege, no matter whichever country it may be. But, if it ever comes to choosing a particular country to work in, I would certainly go for “Japan”.\n\nSince my early university years, I have thought and learned of Japan as an ideal country to look for work opportunities for a number of reasons. But, before I go to explain why I want to work in that country, I would like to say a few things to introduce this great country.\n\nJapan is the world’s 4th largest island country, in East Asia, that encompasses more than 6850 islands in the Pacific Ocean. Being popularly known as “Nippon” or the land of “the rising sun”, Japan also is the second largest “developed economy” and one of the most industrialized nations in the world. By the way, Japan is also one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world.\n\nSo, it is fair to assume that working opportunities in Japan is literally unlimited whether they want to work in manufacturing, mining and construction sectors, or service sectors. But, as far as I am concerned, I would like to work in the information technology (IT) sector as this great country has witnessed an exponential growth in the demand of IT professionals over the last few decades. In fact, I have even learned how Japanese companies are trying to attract foreign workers in order to meet this demand.  So, if I ever get an opportunity to work in Japan, I would like to continue it for at least 3 years.\n\nAnyway, I would like to work in Japan because it has a very good working culture, where everybody treats each other with great respect. Besides, working in a country like Japan would also allow me to gain valuable work experience and use it to further advance my career after coming back to work in my own country. Finally, I would like to work in this great country also because they have a very high salary structure."

    "Answer": "In this busy and complicated life, I have already tried different kinds of activities, whether they are indoor or outdoor. However, today I would like to talk about one particular outdoor activity, which I haven’t tried yet, but would definitely try in the future.  The name of this outdoor activity is “cycling”.\n\nNot sure, when I became fond of “cycling”, but I guess that it might have something to do with Tour de France cycling race back in 2018 which I saw for the first time on TV. Up until I saw that race, I had no idea that “cycling” could actually be such a fun and adventurous activity, which involved riding through some of the most beautiful flat, hilly and mountainous terrains of the world, by employing very impressive physical postures in an artful manner.\n\nIn fact, when I was following the “Tour de France” race, which started in France and then also venturing into the surrounding countries occasionally, I was struggling to decide whether to pay more attention to cycling race itself or the beautiful terrains on its path. Anyway, I didn’t get to try this nice outdoor activity as yet because I haven’t yet managed to buy a bicycle, which I really like. Besides, I am yet to convince my close friends to join me in “cycling” as I don’t really like to do it alone. Then, of course, managing a suitable time to enjoy this physical activity is also an issue because I remain fairly busy with my work and other priorities. However, I am planning to start working on enjoying this nice outdoor activity this summer which is due in a few months.\n\nAnyway, I would like to try this outdoor activity, because it would allow me to free up my hands, legs and muscle, which have become rather ‘stiff’ lately due to the lack of physical exercises. Besides, cycling would help boost my mood by taking me close to the beautiful nature around me. Finally, this great outdoor activity would also allow me to socialize with my friends while also doing some physical exercises at the same time."

    "Answer": "I try not to expect anything from other people when it comes to material possession. But, there are times when we surprisingly end up getting something even when we don’t expect it. Today, I would like to talk about one such occasion when someone offered me something that I really wanted.\n\nIt was back in the year 2016 when I was still a university student. Back then, I used to live at a university hostel, as it was a residential university, so I didn’t really need to use any transportation to travel back and forth to my university. Suddenly, one day, an official order came from the university authority, ordering all the students to vacate the hostel for a couple of weeks, as the building needed some kind renovation works.\n\nBy the way, I think that it was an emergency situation as I had heard some news of accident earlier, involving electric short-circuit and fire.  So, the university authority was very much within its right to deal with the problem on an emergency basis. However, while it was nice on the part of my university authority to deal with the building issue rather quickly, it failed to arrange some kind of suitable accommodation for us, close to the university. But, still, there was no other option for us except moving to our new residences, even though we would need to walk some distance to commute back and forth from our university.  \n\nSo, I thought, it would be great if I could somehow buy or manage a bicycle for my use. I even decided to buy a bicycle at some point.  But, when one of my distant uncles heard about my situation and offered me to use his old bicycle, which he didn’t use anymore, I just couldn’t refuse his kind offer.\n\nAnyway, I felt really glad and grateful that my uncle took the time to consider my situation and decided to help me out. Besides, the offer also brought the “child” in me back again as I thought that I could use the bicycle to roam freely and become little “adventurous” for a while."

But, I will still go ahead and try my best to talk about a particular day which I would consider as my favourite.\n\nNow, I am not sure many people would agree with me, but I consider “Friday” as my favourite day. For the most part, Friday is like any other weekdays to me because, on this day also, I wake up early in the morning as usual and then take a little morning walk outside before coming back to home and then taking a shower. After the shower, I take a light breakfast as I don’t really like to feel too much full in my stomach and sleepy before starting the workday.\n\nBy the way, I live a bit too far away from my work, so I have to wake up really early in order to beat the morning rush and traffics on the roads. After arriving at the office, I head straight to my own desk and start preparing the tasks list for the day after talking to my senior manager and other fellow workers, if needed. The work continues for about 5 long hours and stops at around 1:00 pm for a lunch break.  After finishing lunch, I go back to work again and finish it at around 5:00 pm. Then, I hop into a bus and go straight to my home. Anyway, while this day may seem like any other day, Friday’s are a bit different for me because I feel more energized with an anticipation of a great weekend ahead.\n\nFriday is my favourite day of the week, primarily because I feel more energized and productive on this day by managing to finish my work rather quickly. Besides, this is the day when I get to prepare for a happy weekend without worrying about what might have gone wrong in other days of the week. After all, preparing for a great weekend is actually more fun to me than the actual acts of a weekend."

    "Answer": "To tell the truth, remembering a cool winter is among the least favourite thing to do for me, simply because I try to run away from winter as far as I can. But, no matter how far I try to run, I do have to suffer from “the bite” of winter pretty much every year, just like I did about a few years ago.\n\nAs I have already mentioned earlier, I don’t really like winter.  But, I am pretty sure that Mother Nature doesn’t really care whether I like it or not, just as it didn’t care on a morning in mid-December when I needed to pick up my aunt from the airport. As soon as I woke up and took a peek through my window, I immediately knew that it was going to be a cold morning as I could see fog covering the landscape above the ground. For a minute, I thought that I would wait until the sun had come out but then decided against it, as my aunt wouldn’t like the delay.\n\nSo, I took a taxi and hit the road after wearing all kinds of warm clothes to protect me from the assault of a cold winter morning, as the temperature on that day was probably as low as minus 5 degree Celsius. But, after arriving at the airport, I came to know that there was a flight delay for about two hours because of low visibility in the sky. So, I had no other option but to wait at the airport in open cold, until my auntie arrived, as the airport authority had restricted our access to the arrival lounge because of security reasons.\n\nAnyway, I remember this particular winter morning because it was really cold for my liking. Besides, travelling to the airport and waiting there for about 2 hours in cold was a very troubling experience for me also. Finally, I remember it because there was too much fog in the atmosphere on that day, and I was afraid of having an accident because of the low visibility of the road."

I really like this particular cue card topic because it has allowed me to recall one such interesting thing, which happened about 10/11 years ago when I was about 13 years old.\n\nI was lucky to have attended a great high school, not only because of its great educational curriculum but also because of its great location. In fact, it was located in between a big lake on one side and a big, beautiful “Mahogany” garden on the other. Apart from its interesting and attractive surroundings, my high school also used to attract some beautiful “guest birds” every winter from thousands of miles away, probably from other countries.\n\nOf course, we were already used to seeing the activities of these birds every winter, playing in our school lake and the big, empty playground behind our school, but it was different during one winter. In fact, in that winter, we could see some video cameramen and journalists, probably invited by our school authority, were trying to film and photograph the visiting birds. It became even more fun and interesting for us as we were also allowed to be filmed and photographed with them in action. We also noticed with pleasant surprise that the birds were acting like as if they were also enjoying our attention while also eating our food! Many of us even tried to count how many birds were actually there, visiting our school, but they soon found out that there were just too many to count!\n\nAnyway, “expedition into the world of the guest birds”, as we called it, was indeed one of the most interesting experiences of my life, as it allowed me to interact with some of the most unique and beautiful birds up until then as a young boy. Besides, showing my pictures in action with the birds, along with other friends of mine, on some leading national daily newspapers for the first time, was something I would never forget."

    "Answer": "I try to help out people without seeking any appreciation or any other things in return. And, it is, of course, our human nature to appreciate the help, even though, not all of us show their display their appreciation explicitly. But, today, I would like to talk about a time when someone explicitly appreciated me for my assistance.\n\nIt happened about a few years ago, and my neighbour, Kim Lee, needed to leave the city for a few days in order to see his ailing grandmother.\n\nTo introduce Kim, he could easily be considered as one of the nicest neighbours one could ever hope for, and he lived with his family a couple of blocks away from my house in the same neighbourhood. Kim used to own and run his own small super shop which I used to visit almost every other day in order to buy different kinds of stuff. So, we had a very warm relationship with each other. Thus, when he asked me to watch after his house for a few days, I just couldn’t refuse.\n\nKim told me what exactly needed to be done, including picking up the newspapers from his front lawn every morning, helping his employees to open and close his super shop and turning the lights on of his house during the evening.  He also asked me to spend a couple of hours at his house every day, if possible, and keep the “heater” in his house turned on in order to keep his house warm, as it was really cold at that time. Anyway, Kim left the city after giving me the instructions. But, when he came back after visiting his old and seriously ill grandmother, he didn’t forget to thank me with a very big smile on his happy face.\n\nEven though I wasn’t exactly looking for any kind of appreciation from my neighbour, I felt really great and useful after his words of appreciation. I also felt that a little token of appreciation for our good deeds, from the people around us, would take our relationship even farther,  a really long way."

    "Answer": "I have so many ideas of a perfect holiday destination in my head that it would be practically impossible to choose one and then describe it. However, I would still go ahead and try my best to make sense of my version of a perfect holiday destination.\n\nFirst, my perfect holiday destination would be ideally located on an island, far away from civilization, surrounded by a cool and calm ocean. Of course, when I say that my perfect holiday destination would be far away from civilization, I don’t necessarily mean to suggest that it would very far from the airport.  \n\nThe island would be covered by many different kinds of fruit trees, along with other kinds beautiful forests and landscapes, so that I can always enjoy the taste of some fresh fruits when feeling hungry. The weather should neither be too hot or too cold of my perfect holiday destination. Having some beautiful looking sandy beaches, my perfect holiday destination shouldn’t have any tall buildings or hotels, covering the sky, so that I can actually see the beautiful sky and the moon at night.  I wouldn’t like my perfect holiday destination to be too quiet nor too crowded and busy because that would actually take the whole fun away of mingling and socializing with people from different countries and culture. Having a few hills and mountains by the sides of the sea beaches wouldn’t exactly hurt my version of a perfect holiday destination either. Finally, the hotels in my ideal holiday destination should be close to the sandy beaches so that I can capture a perfect overview of the ocean by sitting in their balconies.\n\nAnyway, it would be my perfect holiday destination, mainly because it would help me forget about the worries and negativities of my daily life. Besides, it would also allow me to learn, understand and appreciate people from other countries, cultures and backgrounds in a way which is not possible ot"

    "Answer": "After our old car has started giving frequent troubles lately, I and my family have finally agreed in principle that it is time to buy a new car. Of course, we are still arguing about what type of car to buy this time, but I am opting for a 4-door Sedan.\n\nThe car, I would like to own, is a black and shiny Toyota Corolla. It is an 1800 cc, 4-cylinder, 3200 horsepower and automatic transmission car. Offering a seating capacity of 5 passengers, the seats in this car are fully made of leather. Offering a cruise controlling option, this particular car also has a safety airbag, attached to its steering wheel, in order to ensure maximum safety.\n\nThis sleek and stylish car has great mileage, offering about 30 miles per gallon when driving in the city. Once I buy this car, it will not only help me save my time when travelling to and from my work but also can carry my whole family to different places at their convenience. Besides, this car would allow me to take care of important house choirs, like carrying groceries in bulk or carrying other household things. Besides, it would also help me ease my tension in a great deal when I visit to see my old grandparents in another city, which is quite far from where I live. In fact, visiting my old grandparents is one of the main reason for which I would like to own this vehicle, as our old car gives us a lot of trouble when travelling a long distance.\n\nAnyway, I wish, I could buy this vehicle today, but I will have to wait until next year to get it because of some financial issues.\n\nAnyway, I want to own this vehicle, mainly because it is affordable, and it has many great features, like great mileage, and other advanced technologies. Besides, this is a spacious enough car where my entire family can fit in rather comfortably. Finally, I want to own this vehicle also because it is very reliable and comes with a great engine."

    "Answer": "I am not exactly known to be a very “resourceful” person even on my best days. Besides, it is not like I have practised any art or craft a lot. However, when I was growing up as a child, I had a habit of playing with lumbers (wooden pieces), and that’s when I learned to make some wooden frames and toys. Surprisingly, I even made a few nice toys back then, and I would just like to share that story here.\n\nNow, please don’t think that I made a lot of toys as a child or when I was growing up, but it was just a little secret hobby of mine, which I used to enjoy from time to time in my solitude. Anyway, one doesn’t really have to have the intellect or smartness of a rocket scientist to make some toys because all one would need is some solid wood pieces, a good knife, some perfect size nails and some screws. We could also use a “mini saw” and a screwdriver, if needed, but I would suggest you to be a bit more careful when using a “saw”.\n\nOf course, we also need to know how much wood and what kind of hardware are needed to do a certain type of toy. Once we know, what kind of toys we want to make, we start crafting the perfect size templates by either cutting the wood pieces or connecting them with each other by using the nails and screws. Now, as for trimming the wood pieces, you could do it either before completing your toys or after it. But, as for me, I trim all the wood pieces before using them to make my toys.  This toy-making thing can take a while, but I like it.\n\nAnyway, I feel really great about making it myself. In fact, it is very fulfilling and confidence-boosting to see the results of your own works. Besides, I also like the fact that I can actually relax and forget about my worries when doing these little things all by myself by becoming a bit creative."

    "Answer": "I like to watch all kinds of movies just for the fun of it, but I don’t necessarily remember any particular movie characters or care to consider them any more special than the others. However, there is one character, which deserves special attention from some unworthy critiques like me, because of its very distinct appeal and universal acclamation.\n\nThe name of this character is “Vito Corleone” from one of the best movies, ever made in the history of films, called “The Godfather”.  After watching “the godfather” about 8 years ago for the first time, I wanted to watch the movie again after a few weeks. Later, I watched the movie once again after a month or so. It was that there was just something mysterious and unexplainable about that movie which drew me to watch it again and again.\n\nThen, a few months later, I realized that it was the special character of “Vito Corleone”, played by one of the best actors ever of Hollywood called Marlon Brando. Anyway, Vito Corleone character was inspired by real-life mafia boss “Frank Costello”, who is presented as a very cunning and intelligent mafia boss at the same time that made him to this day a very quotable character – a character which has become a quintessential part of popular American culture.\n\nHowever even though Vitro Corleone is portrayed to be a very ruthless and cunning mafia boss, he also seems to be a very caring father, who wants to keep his family and sons from all kinds of the danger of the mafia world.  Vito also seems to be too soft-spoken for a mafia boss in the movie who believes in brevity as much as justice and honour.\n\nAnyway, I really like this Vito Corleone character because he seems to be a very complex personality, who cares about his family so much, and yet, he has so much interest in all kinds of organized crimes just to keep the control of mafia underworld. Vito Corleone is essentially the “man”, every male person would like to become, who is always able to see through the best and the worst."

    "Answer": "There are very few people, at least, people who like to remain informed about the political development of this world, who don’t know about \"Angela Merkel\". In fact, she is considered as the most powerful woman in this world today, and she also happens to be the de facto leader of the European Union. Well, a female leader I really like and admire is none other than the charismatic German Chancellor “Angela Merkel”.\n\nThis great female leader, one of the best female leaders, in my opinion, the world has ever seen, maybe from German, but she certainly has left her marks in dealing with each and every international political crisis since she took her office as a German Chancellor in the year of 2005.  Also known as the “leader of the free world”, this great world political figure was born in 1954 in the city Hamburg and has been elected to rule German for 4 consecutive terms, a feat which no female politicians have ever achieved in the world’s history.\n\nAs a political leader, her political activities are easily noticeable, but it is the intentions behind those activities that have made her a great leader. In fact, Angela Markel’s decision to allow more than one million political refugees, displaced because of wars, into German was a landmark decision which would make the world to remember her for a long, long time. Besides, providing financial help to other countries, especially in Europe, is also something that the world would remember very gratefully because it helped stabilize the economy of the entire world little over a decade ago.\n\nAnyway, I really like Angela Markel because she seems to be a very charismatic and intelligent leader who understands the dynamics of world politics much better than the other contemporary leaders. I like her also because she is not afraid to take unpopular decisions in order to uphold the principles of humanity. Finally, I like her because her leadership approaches help bring the world community together instead of actually dividing them over some petty differences."

    "Answer": "I have read the “please keep silent” sign at many places before, but I never really took it too seriously, perhaps because keeping silent isn’t exactly my nature. But, I still needed to maintain my silence once because the situation had just demanded it. Today, I would like to break that story and tell you what the situation really was.\n\nIt was about a couple of years ago when I took my little niece to take an admission test for grade-1 at an elementary school, which was a bit far away from where my niece's family lived. My niece, a 4-years-old girl, was a bit nervous about being left alone at a completely strange place. So, I decided to stay close to my niece in a separate room, next to the place where my niece was taking the test.\n\nAnyway, since the admission test would continue for one good hour, I thought that it would be better for me if I had just used my phone to inform my elder brother about how her little daughter was doing. But, as soon as I started to talk over my phone in a rather low voice, I was asked to keep silent. Understanding the situation, I then decided to pick up some newspapers from the desk and read them to pass my time. But, even that privilege was taken away from me, simply because I was making just a bit too much noise when I was turning the newspaper pages!\n\nApparently, the school authority didn’t want to distract the little children while they were taking the admission test. So, I just kept my silence at the test venue like a “good boy” until the test was over.\n\nAnyway, initially, I felt a bit annoyed with such a strong rule about maintaining silence, but I eventually realized that so was done only to help the children to keep their maximum focus on the test. Besides, the practice also gave me an early impression that my little niece would learn the much-needed lessons on maintaining discipline in life from an early age if admitted to that school."

However, I don’t really get much of an opportunity to travel by plane, but I know a person who does.\n\nHe is none other than my 45 years old neighbour \"William Henry\". I have known William for more than 10 years, since the time he moved to our neighbourhood, but I have seldom seen him travelling by train or bus when travelling a long distance.\n\nIn fact, I talked to him for the first time when I was going to pick up one of my friends at the domestic airport in my city. After that, I have seen him travelling by plane at least once a month. Of course, he takes a bus or train when he travels to short distances, but that too is only because no aeroplane flies to those places!\n\nAnyway, I have travelled with this neighbour of mine a few times in the last few years or so, and every time I have travelled with him, he has advised me to fly as much as I could in order to save more time. He also told me that the more time I would save, the more money I would be able to make except, of course, he knew it very well that I wasn’t exactly as shrewd of a businessman as he is.\n\nIndeed, my neighbour, William Henry, is a very successful businessman, as he is involved in exporting and importing different kinds of products. Besides, he is also the president of our city chamber of commerce, the apex body of all the businesses and industries of my city.\n\nAnyway, I think that he frequently travels by plane because he wants to save time as much as he can in order to become more financially successful. Besides, since he has to travel to different places rather frequently, comfort also becomes an issue, and travelling by plane undoubtedly offers the best comfort one could hope for."

Needless to say, this practice has often helped me in making decisions at crunch times. Today, I would like to talk about one such conversation, that I had, after passing my junior college.\n\nIt was about 10 years ago when I failed to get admission at the medical college. Actually, not being able to pass the medical college entrance examination was one of the most shocking experiences of my life. Of course, it was not an easy admission test at all because only the most brilliant students with great academic results usually take part in these tests in order to study medical science at the medical colleges of my country. However, while I don’t exactly think that I fall in the category of the most brilliant students of my country, I still thought that I would be able to pull off a miracle since I studied really hard throughout my previous years for this purpose.\n\nAnyway, after failing to secure a place at a medical college, I remained confused and clueless for a considerable period of time. I even felt really depressed at times after that shocking news. So, I decided to head to my elder uncle, hoping that he would provide me some intelligent conversation and comfort in order to help me get out of this Jinx. The conversation had continued for about 30 minutes which provided a lot of important insights to me about life, as well as how the definition of “success” and “failure” changes in the life of people, as time progresses.\n\nAnyway, I felt much better about my life after having that conversation with my uncle, as it provided me with the much-needed direction for my life. In fact, the conversation helped me realize the fact that we should always explore other avenues of success, when we fail to achieve a certain dream, instead of feeling down and depressed. Besides, it was after this conversation, I learned to work even harder instead of complaining about the system and situation."

Some of these companies have succeeded in doing so while the others have failed. However, today, I would like to talk about one of these companies that have succeeded.\n\nIt is a telecommunication company. Having started its journey about 15 years ago, this company has successfully established itself as the leading telecommunication service provider in my country, with more than 80 million subscribers and almost 50% subscriber market share. It is a joint venture between a foreign company and a major corporation of my country, and it is done a tremendous job of providing the telecommunication services, that almost has a 99% cellular network coverage area of the entire country, at the very grass root level of my country and that too provided at a very affordable cost.\n\nMainly providing internet and mobile phone services, this large telecommunication company has set up thousands of stores and service centres all over the country in order to help their customers quickly and efficiently. The company also has a huge corporate head office in the capital city of our country. Both of these stores/service centres and the corporate head office have employed tens of thousands of youths so far. At the stores and service centres, these youth employees are responsible to take care of the customer service roles and technical support, many youths at the corporate head office are responsible to write computer programmes, designing and developing web interfaces for the eCommerce services, product quality assurances and so on.\n\nAnyway, the operation of this company is really important for my country, mainly because it directly contributes to its economic growth by helping our government earn huge revenue. Besides, it also helps to address some serious and overall unemployment problems in my country. Finally, its operation is important also because it helps the entire country connected not only among its own citizens but also with the rest of the world."

Today, as per the requirement of this cue card topic, I would like to talk about one of those few times when I moved to a new school.\n\nIt happened about 15 years ago when I was about 14 years old and attending my 8th grade. Back then, we, together with my parents and the siblings, all moved to a nice little town because my father got promoted in his job.\n\nInitially, I wasn’t really sure whether to like the new place or not. But, after a few days, I started to tell myself that it wasn’t exactly a bad place to live. However, when it came to getting admission to my new high school, I felt really shocked because of the fact that the staffs were not exactly as helpful as my previous school. In fact, I had to go to my new high school a couple of times just to get an admission. However, when I actually started my classes, I found out that my fellow classmates were rather nice and helpful. In fact, the class captain ordered all the students to introduce themselves to me. This particular good gesture on the part of my fellow classmates actually helped me get over the initial shock of starting my new high school.\n\nSlowly after that, I started to like my new school and its environment. Even the staffs and teachers started to recognize me as I started to perform well in my class.\n\nAnyway, moving to this new high school was a bit shocking experience for me as I wasn’t exactly treated very nicely. But, I kept telling myself to be patient. I also realized that in life, things don’t always turn out to be the way we expect and that we should always remain positive in life if we really want to improvise and succeed in life."

Well, it happened to me so many times and in fact, our life is exciting and unpredictable because it keeps surprising us. Thank you very much for the opportunity to let me talk about one such experience.\n\nA few years ago, I was travelling to Spain alone and this was the third time for me to travel out of my country and the first time a solo trip to such a long distance. I am not a frequent air traveller and take-off and landing of the plane give me an uncomfortable feeling that I am yet to get accustomed to. However, during my flight to Spain, I got a window seat and the experience of flying above the cloud and seeing the whole city from almost 10 thousand feet above the ground was captivating and something quite new for me.\n\nSince I was alone and the flight was at night, I spent most of my time reading a book on my ebook reader or looked outside through the window. As usual, I was a bit nervous when the plane started its journey and went high in the sky. But I soon forget about my uncomfortable feelings when I looked outside and was thrilled to look at the distant city that I have just left.\n\nFrom above, it looked like a small land filled with many lights, perhaps comparable to fireflies, and the experience of looking at it was something surreal. The same feeling returned when it was almost the time to land on the Madrid Airport and I could see a range of illuminated areas which, to me, seems like some lively pictures that came to reality like the computer animation. Large buildings were nothing more than a few dots and the whole city seemed like a great work of an artist who knew how to place them!\n\nI could hear the safety announcement by a cabin crew but I was so busy perceiving and enjoying the view that hardly any word of the announcement reached my ear. I was, as if, turned in to a small baby trying to figure out how a butterfly could fly or a fish can swim. I was so overwhelmed with it that I returned to reality when people were rushing to the exit door which means the plane had safely landed and I did not worry about the uncomfortable feelings of landing even for a second."

Then I told myself to calm down and not to panic because that would be no help.\n\nSo, I took my time and kept looking at its different parts while matching their information with what I had learned about them earlier in a computer hardware book. Slowly and slowly things started to become easier to me as I finally understood what each and part in that computer was really was and what their functionalities really were. Little later, when my nerve calmed down, I started to take each part out of that computer at a time until I was satisfied. Of course, when I was taking those computer parts out from their places, I tried to really hard to remember about their original state and position so that I could put them back in the right places just the way they really were before being taken out.\n\nAnyway, not sure how long exactly I spent in inspecting the parts of that computer but when I finally managed to put all those computer parts back in the computer case, I felt like I had won the Mount Everest.\n\nAnyway, it was something I really enjoyed, primarily because I managed to overcome my fear without the help of an expert or any other people.

One such event that I can still recall happened a few years ago when I was travelling to (say a country name which is not yours). I will share my experience with you.\n\nI planned a holiday tour to (say the country name again) with two of my classmates, and we thought the holiday and its excitements would refresh us from a long and tiring semester. As planned, we took our flight and reached the destination airport safely. However, the immigration checkpoint queue was unusually long and at least 50 people were ahead of us in the line. We had to wait for more than an hour before I could proceed to the counter. To my dismay, just after I handed over him my passport, the officer in charge asked me to go to the immigration clearance room located on a different floor! After I informed him that I was travelling with two of my friends, he got angry and asked me to leave the counter! That was pretty harsh and unexpected from someone taking care of such a delicate matter like immigration clearance.\n\nI had to yield to his whimsical decision and talk to another immigration officer who for more than 20 minutes asked me different questions and literally tried to grill me in an embarrassing situation. Some of these questions were pretty reasonable and valid but a few of them were disgusting and completely out of the context.\n\nI felt as if I was being punished for something I never did, and at a point, I felt like saying to the immigration personnel that \"thank you for your service but I no longer wish to travel to your country\". I was that mad and frustrated. But in the end, he cleared all of us and apologized to us sarcastically (I am saying sarcastically because I felt he did not mean it).\n\nWe, at last, entered the country and despite an initial shock, the whole experience was pretty awesome. We had an excellent and reinvigorating holiday. I just wished the frustrating experience at the immigration checkpoint did not occur."

And, I am saying this about not feeling uncomfortable easily because I usually have some valid excuses or ways to get out of any uncomfortable situation most of the times. But, unfortunately, that’s not to happen when I couldn’t return a book to my university library.\n\nWell, the story goes like this. When I was a university student about 8 years ago, I used to borrow a lot of books from my university library and returned them all on time after reading them. But, once I borrowed a very interesting book, and it was so interesting that I had to read it at least half-a-dozen of times. So, I kept extending the returning date for this book again and again and kept it reading until suddenly I lost it one day.\n\nBy the way, I lost the book because I carried it with me to all kinds of places. After all, I wanted to utilize my free time in reading this book, but little did I know that one day I would leave that book by mistake either at one of those places, I visited, or in a bus while visiting those places.\n\nAnyway, finally, the time arrived for me to return that book to my university library except, of course, I didn’t have any book to return. So, seeing no way out, I described what had exactly happened to the librarian, but as soon as I finished telling the incident to that librarian gentleman, he started to yell at me in a loud voice, telling how irresponsible I really was. However, I just kept quiet as long as he yelled at me, knowing that it was my fault.\n\nNeedless to say, I felt very awkward and uncomfortable in that situation even though, I must say that I wasn’t exactly expecting that kind of harsh reaction from that librarian.

A few days before that, I travelled to Kuala Lumpur on an official trip and unfortunately, during my return flight, one of my luggage was lost at the (mention the name of the airport in your country) airport. I waited for more than 3 hours and talked to several airport officials as well as two persons from the aviation authority but my luggage was nowhere. I was so frustrated about the event that I sat at the corner of the airport for half an hour blaming myself for the incident though I knew that I had nothing to do about it.\n\nThe lost luggage, tragically, had some important documents and my laptop in it, including some gift items I have purchased for my family and a couple of colleagues.\n\nAfter several attempts throughout the whole week from my side after the incident, I lost all hope and stopped contacting with the airport authority. But on 4th July, almost two weeks later, I received an email from the airport authority that my luggage was found and I could go and claim my luggage any weekday during the office hours.\n\nIt could have been just another email sitting innocently on my inbox, but it was not. It carried a piece of great news and I was utterly relieved to receive the email. It was one of the most important emails I have ever received because it was unexpected, literally came at a moment when I was least expecting it.

There, in the job fair, he provided me with a lot of tips and advice about how to apply to a job and how to face an interview.\n\nOf course, I didn’t get any job offer from that job fair, but it certainly offered me the chance to build a brotherly relationship with a great person. But, then suddenly one day about 6 months ago, he was diagnosed with lung cancer, and he immediately had to go abroad for his treatment. There, he was receiving his chemotherapy except that I just didn’t know what his condition was. On the other hand, I didn’t want to contact him, thinking that it would probably bother him more than happy. So, I just kept praying for him while waiting for some sort of news about him.

    "Answer": "Well, that's an intriguing topic and I am delighted that I have been given a chance to talk about something I feel deeply but can't discuss very often.\n\nThe obvious and yet very unpopular opinion I want to talk about is how our police and special security forces have been given an autocratic power to get away with their misconducts and oftentimes serious crimes. I am not talking about one or two corrupt cops and their discrete horrendous acts, but about the whole system that helps them get away with it.\n\nPolice and special forces are meant to protect ordinary people and their property and lives and maintain peace and harmony in our society by acting lawfully. They are also a part of society and they should be made responsible for any crime they commit. But, the legislative system and the existing policies make it really tough to hold them responsible and discriminate when it comes to ensuring justice. Police, in our country and many other countries, go unpunished for their crimes but ordinary citizens are convicted swiftly for the same crime. It's like a single country with dual policy and that's something I believe is totally unfair and unjust.\n\nI have been holding this unpopular opinion for more than ten years. The first time a corrupt cop killed an innocent boy in our neighbourhood over a false charge of extortion and got away with it, I started to believe that something is wrong in our system. Despite the media attention and demonstration from ordinary citizens, the same policeman is now working in a different department with the police and seems like have been promoted for his crime!\n\nI have shared my opinion with a few of my friends and their opinions are mostly against these discriminatory policies and system. My uncle is a retired policeman and when I discussed it with him, to my surprise, his opinion accords with mine.\n\nThis is an unpopular opinion because people don't want to talk about it, let alone do something to break the corrupt system. They either believe that they can't do anything about it or feel that police personnel are above the law and should be granted special privileges. Their opinion is often biased because they consider it a political issue rather than a social or human right issue."

    "Answer": "I am not exactly an opinionated person who likes to impose his views or opinion on others. But, there are some issues and opinions, which I feel really strongly about from time to time. Today, I would like to talk about one such opinion which is considered to be very unpopular by many.\n\nThis unpopular opinion involves imposing more than 100% vat or sales tax on all kinds of tobacco products/cigarettes and banning public smoking altogether, if possible. I have held this opinion for more than a decade, after witnessing the death of one of my dear uncles, but I started to feel even more strongly about all kinds of smoking in the recent years after learning about its negative effects on our health and environments.\n\nIn fact, Smoking can cause fatal diseases such as pneumonia, emphysema and lung cancer. Smoking causes 84% of deaths from lung cancer and 83% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). And, I am not even talking about the more regular negative health effects like cough, cold, wheezing and asthma. On top of that, the negative effects of smoking on our environments are just immeasurable, given the fact that trillions of cigarettes filters/butts, made of a form of cellulose acetate plastic, are tossed out every year worldwide which takes about a decade to decompose and then getting absorbed by the soil. And, because of this long process to recycle these plastic matters back to the soil, it slowly and slowly loses its fertility and natural characteristics to liven our earth.  By the way, I have already taken up the issue to our local city council authority to put some kind of ban on smoking, but they simply laughed at my suggestion.  \n\nAnyway, I think that this is an unpopular opinion, mainly because the businessmen, who are involved with the business of manufacturing and selling tobacco products, are vehemently opposing this idea because that would make them lose their business and money. Besides, some chain smokers would simply never let go of their habit of smoking because they are just too addicted to this deadly habit."

    "Answer": "We, as human, constantly learn and this knowledge and our life experiences shape who we become or choose to become. Pretty recently, I have learned about something called \"minimalism\" from a documentary on TV and it was entertaining and thought-provoking. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to let me talk about it.\n\n\"Minimalism\" is not about becoming a hermit in a jungle or giving away everything we have. Rather it's a concept that allows us to focus on more important aspects of life by breaking the chain of gaining and owing more and more. Statistically speaking, we are living in a rich era of affluence and prosperity and yet we are slaves to our desire of material gain and success that seems unattainable due to our changing goals and social pressure. We are living lives defined by capitalism and the corporate world and have little time to focus on what is truly important in our life like our family and friends, neighbours, relationship, peace and happiness. \"Minimalism\" thus tells us to get rid of things we do not need like three smartphones, 30 pairs of shoes and closet full of designers clothes and focus on what makes us happy.\n\nI learned it from a TV documentary that I watched a few weeks ago and it was a top-class production. The way it was presented, the speakers who talked about it and the way it was made are simply outstanding. It was not just another TV shows or movies that we often forget about just after watching it. It was deep and it covered an unpopular topics that people usually tend to avoid thinking about.\n\nThe impact of the concept that it has had on me is tremendous. I no longer feel bad because I don't own the latest car or don't earn a six-figure salary. I have been thinking about the messages this documentary tried to gave us and it was astounding. I have started focusing on being happier and spending quality time with people I care and people who care about me rather than feeling bad about all the things I don't have. Minimalism teaches about being happier with less because it's always quality that counts, not the quantity."

    "Answer": "I have a habit of reading different kinds of health journals, and other books that are related to medical and healthcare information. So, the other day, when I found an international journal on herbal medicines, I naturally became curious and started to read it. Needless to say, I learned a lot of things about the use and benefits of different kinds of plants and herbals medicines like \"mushroom\".\n\nAnyway, talking about the benefits of mushroom, I already had some idea that mushroom was used as some sort of medicines, but I didn’t know what kinds of illness it is used to treat or how useful they really are in treating those illnesses. But, reading that journal on herbal medicines opened my eyes like never before. For example, I didn’t know that mushrooms are very much antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral in nature. In other words, they help ward off all kinds of viruses, bacterial infections and bad fungal overgrowths way more effectively than many medicines.\n\nBy the way, I find it really surprising that the modern-day “allopathic” treatment doesn’t really go far enough to recognise the benefits of mushroom or, for that matter, other herbal medicines in treating virus-born or bacterial diseases, especially, when it has miserably failed to treat these illnesses on its own.\n\nAnyway, I found this “mini-lesson” session with the herbal medicine journal to be really important and useful because they will go a long way, as far as I am concerned, to help me reap the benefits of the herbal medicines. In fact, now that I know that these herbal medicines help us heal naturally, stabilizes our metabolism and hormones, and strengthen our immune system while having very few unintended side effects, I can sure use them to heal me on a regular basis. Besides, I also firmly believe that more research works should be conducted to find about the more natural healing power of these herbal medicines, and the sooner we do it, the better will it fare for the well-being of the humanity."

This is why I scarcely experience overcrowd in most of the places I go to. However, a few months ago I went to watch a football match at the largest stadium in our city and it was packed with thousands of people, and at a time I felt like I had never seen so many people at a single place in my life.\n\nIt was a major football competition in our country which happened to take place last November and I decided to watch the semifinal of the tournament with two of my friends. As planned, we went to the stadium three hours before the match and was surprised to see the wave of people and long lines in the ticket counter. We had to move like ants in the line and I believe, it took us more than an hour just to enter the stadium due to the crowd and long queue.\n\nI was even more surprised when I entered the stadium as I could see people all around me of all ages. It was a friendly crowd but overwhelming for me. We had to shout to talk to each other as the noise was all around us. I felt good to be there and experienced a really thrilling semifinal which was quite entertaining and suspenseful till the end."

    "Answer": "I don’t really like to visit a crowded place unless I have a very valid reason to do so. But, I still needed to visit one such congested place, a livestock buying and selling place that is, about a few years ago because I needed to buy a cow from there in order to sacrifice it during one of our major Muslim religious festivals.\n\nThe crowded place, I visited, was one of the biggest in my region, but I didn’t really feel like going there, mainly because it was too big of a place, with so many people and domestic animals from different parts of my country, which had very little or almost no order in place.\n\nBy the way, it was a very popular street market because people from all over my country would visit it once a year in order to buy cows and goats for the purpose of sacrificing them during a major Muslim religious festival called “Eid-ul-Azha”. As much as I loved the idea of visiting the market to buy an animal in order to sacrifice it, I wasn’t really very comfortable to go there alone because it would be quite a challenge for me to bring the animal home all by myself. So, I requested one of my cousins to visit the market with me, and he gladly obliged. Anyway, after visiting the animal “hut”, I became very overwhelmed to see so many cows and goats, ready to be sold to their new owners, while both the sellers and buyers, including me, were busy to get the best bargaining deals for their animals.\n\nAnyway, I had a mixed feeling about visiting this crowded place because on one hand, people there, especially the buyers, were very excited to choose and buy their favourite animals, but, on the other hands, the sellers seemed to have very little or no respect for individual taste and preferences of the buyers. Besides, the place was so crowded that I actually had to wait about 15 minutes just to decide how I would get out of the market without getting lost."

    "Answer": "I am not exactly one of those people who get disappointed easily over anything. But, I guess that it is absolutely alright to be frustrated once in a while when there is a huge difference between what one expects to receive and what is being offered just as happened to me about a couple of years ago.\n\nIt was in the year of 2017 when the capital city of my country had organized an international trade fair just like every other year. In fact, this tradition of organizing international trade fair is a regular feature among many other international events of my country for the last 25 years or so except, of course, I never really cared to attend it. However, I decided to attend the trade fair about a couple of years ago because a couple of my friends told me some top-rated brands and prestigious companies from around the world would participate in the fair.\n\nThe fair authority even advertised that if we would spend a certain amount of money in buying any products from the trade fair, the companies would offer up to 50% discounts on all of their products.  So, after hearing these lucrative offers and exciting news, I finally decided to head to the trade fair along with my friends. But, when I actually arrived there, I could easily find out that mostly “very mediocre” products and merchandises were being sold at that fair. I even felt that those “popular and prestigious” companies from different countries attended the fair to sell us only those products that they couldn’t sell in their own countries. Besides, the prices of most of the products there were very high. So, indeed, it was a truly disappointing experience.\n\nAnyway, after going to the fair, I felt like it was a total waste of time because I couldn’t really find a product, which I liked, at a reasonable price. Besides, I also felt that they trade fair authority duped us by advertising false promises in order to bring more and more customers to the fair."

    "Answer": "I am not exactly a very outgoing person or a “social bug” who likes to socialize with strangers or meet everybody around, let alone having conversations with them.  But, on one occasion, I did talk with a complete stranger, at a time, when I was least expecting it.\n\nI met him at a local airport in my country when we both were travelling to one of the major cities in my country about a year ago or so.  We both were waiting at the departure lounge, sitting next to each other, in order to board our flight.  Suddenly, the gentleman, probably in his mid 40’s, requested me to look after his luggage and belongings so that he could go and grab some fresh coffee from one of the coffee stores at the airport.  I reluctantly agreed to his request, but I didn’t forget to ask him politely to return as soon as possible to attend his luggage and belongings, as I didn’t really like to take any responsibility for the stuff of other people, let alone a complete stranger.\n\nThe gentleman came back quickly with two cups of coffee instead of just one.  He offered me one, and I, again, reluctantly accepted it.  It was at the point that he introduced himself to me as a very successful businessman.  Anyway, after that little introduction, I told him that he shouldn’t have left his belongings to a complete stranger like me.  In response, he simply told me that he had become a successful and happy man, both in his personal and professional life, mainly because he had learned to trust others.  Needless to say, after listening to such a positive response, I felt really embarrassed because of my poor treatment of him earlier.\n\nAnyway, after having a conversation with the stranger, I felt that I needed to become more broad-minded towards others to learn more about the valuable lessons of life. Besides, I also realized that we all needed to trust somebody at some point in our life if we really wanted to become happy and successful in life."

    "Answer": "I think that, in these days, it is really very hard to imagine a life without having some sort of access to a computer because it allows us to use so many different kinds of software and tools to make our life easy. Of course, different people use different kinds of software and applications, depending on their level of skills and needs, for different purposes, but when it comes to a person like me, with rather limited computer skill, Microsoft Office is my saviour.\n\nOf course, it is not really necessary to introduce \"Microsoft Office\", but just to make things clear, it is a collection of handy tools, which was first developed on the 1st of August of 1988 by Bill Gates, for the use of business and office works.\n\nBut, I didn’t learn about this software or start to use it until early 2005 when I started school. Since then, I have played with this software and used its applications like Word, Excel and PowerPoint at every opportunity. Today, as an Office Manager of a prestigious company in my country, I use “Word” to create all sorts of documents in order to communicate with my fellow workers and superiors.\n\nHowever, this particular application called “Microsoft word” comes real handy when I prepare a periodic report for my bosses, along with the excel charts on it, in order to show the progress of the production of our chocolate cake factory and the productivity of our workers. Sometimes, I also use PowerPoint to make some presentation to my fellow workers to show the overall progress of our works and efforts in order to motivate my workers.\n\nAnyway, this software is really important for me because it provides great peace of mind for me because I know that I can take care of all of my office works quickly and easily. Besides, the best thing about this software is that I can use it at my home also to take care of important office documents and reports when I am too busy to go to the office."

In fact, I consider that doing such a thing is generally the characteristic of a nosy person, and I have set a standard for myself not to be nosy at any time. But, unfortunately, sticking to this standard just may not be easy, when you are in a public place, and when strangers around you talk about all sorts of things, just as I couldn’t do it on a few occasions.\n\nAnyway, it wasn’t like I was actually trying to overhear the conversation of that stranger when I was sitting at a food court of a shopping mall and enjoying some gourmet foods about a few months ago. Rather, I felt like the stranger, talking over his smartphone, was actually trying to attract attention from other people around him by boasting about how he tricked one of his fellow co-workers to cover for him at his work by making up some fabricated stories (I could call them just some “lies” in plain English).\n\nThe conversation had continued for almost 15 minutes, which provided complete details to the person on the other end as to how the stranger was planning to use his “holidays” into finding some real estate properties in another city instead of actually seeing his “imaginary” seriously sick uncle. At one point of his conversation, I even felt like moving away from the stranger after giving him some clues on how people around him were actually listening to his conversation, but I decided against it and just wanted to finish my food as soon as possible and leave that place.\n\nAnyway, I felt a bit awkward and also embarrassed at the same time because I overheard a conversation which was quite distasteful by my standard. I also felt like we all have some kinds of secrets, and we all should try to keep them as such, by trying not to talk about them in any kind of public places, because our secrets can always be used against us."

Sometimes, we remember some of them while we forget about many others. I guess that forgetting about people, who we don’t see often, is just a human nature just like I forgot about the young banker, whom I met a long time ago.\n\nBut, very recently, I met this young banker again at a local shopping centre when I went there to buy some regular household stuff. Interestingly, it was not me who recognized him first, but rather it was the young banker (not so young anymore though) who called me with my name from behind. I looked back, but initially, I had no clue as to who that person could really be. So, I just kept staring at him until he came forward and introduced me as the young banker who I met about 8 years ago at a bank in another city.\n\nSlowly but surely, my memories started to come back to me when he reminded me how I forgot to pick up my bank chequebook and left the city. It was then that I clearly remembered how that young banker fellow at that time called me from his bank and informed me about my lost chequebook. Later on, this kind banker actually took all the pains to mail me my lost chequebook in a courier service.\n\nAnyway, after meeting him again at the shopping centre after such a long time, I felt like he deserved a very special thank from me again for his sincere efforts to send me back my bank chequebook.\n\nAnyway, after meeting the young banker, I learned a very important lesson which was that we should always remember the good deeds of the people if not the people themselves. I didn’t care to remember the banker, but the banker cared to remember me, which proves that he is a genuinely nice, responsible and caring person. And, if we don’t like to get to know a nice, responsible and caring person, then who we will!?"

But, for better or worse, waiting for something or someone is a reality of life, and we have to wait, no matter how much we dislike it, just as I didn’t like it when one of my fellow co-workers kept me waiting for a long period of time for no valid reasons.\n\nIt was about a few months ago when this happened at my work.  Anyway, it was Friday, so I was naturally a bit excited to leave my office as soon as I could and enjoy the weekend. But, suddenly, one of my fellow workers jumped in front of me just an hour before the closing of our office and asked me to loan my motorbike to him. He told me that he needed to go out for some emergency reasons and that also he would come back just in time before the office had closed. So, I just gave the key of my motorbike to my co-worker in good faith only, of course, to find out that he just couldn’t properly value my good faith.\n\nIn fact, instead of showing up after an hour, he actually showed up after several hours. Anyway, I tried to keep my calm when he came back and asked me what really had caused him to delay for such a long time. In response, he said that he had gone to see a friend at the hospital, and he just got stuck there. He also politely apologized for the delay.\n\nAnyway, after waiting for such a long time, I naturally felt a bit frustrated and even annoyed at the irresponsible act of my co-worker, especially, at a time when I was planning to leave my office as soon as possible.

I guess that’s probably the reason, I arrive late on most occasions despite my best efforts and intention. But, today, I would like to talk about a time when I actually managed to arrive early by overcoming all odds and challenges.\n\nTo tell the story, I would never forget about the day when my dear elder brother was celebrating his 12th wedding anniversary at his home, about a hundred kilometres away from my hometown, because it was on this occasion that I actually managed to arrive at an event early – a lot early.\n\nBy the way, even though, my brother is considerably older than me, we always have enjoyed a very special and friendly relationship between us. So, he had threatened me earlier that if I arrived at his 12th wedding anniversary late again, he would have simply packed me in a bag and thrown me into a gravity-defying spacecraft so that I could finally gain some “speed” in my life. Of course, it was a joke from my elder brother, but I could probably feel his frustration also a bit because on all the previous occasions, whether he was celebrating his birthdays or wedding anniversaries, I had always usually been the last person to arrive.\n\nI am not too sure that an elder brother would actually appreciate such a callous behaviour from a younger brother like me, whom he (the elder brother) loves so much. So, around this time, I took it upon myself as a challenge to arrive early just for the sake of making my elder brother happy.\n\nAnyway, after arriving early, I felt like I was finally coming of age and becoming a responsible person to respect the wishes of my loved ones.

In fact, I feel like many of those positive feedbacks were thrown at me just to be nice to me. But, I can remember at least one feedback, which I received about 7 years ago as a university student, as a genuine one.\n\nTo tell the story, when I was a university student, I used to do some home tutoring for high school students, teaching mostly the subjects of general science which included physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. By the way, I liked to do this home tutoring thing because it allowed me to remain in the mood of studying since I was also studying science as a university student. Besides, it also helped me a little with my pocket money.\n\nAnyway, while all of my students, taking home lessons from me, were reasonably smart and talented, at least one of them was a bit weak in understanding the science subjects, especially, the mathematics. So I decided to inform his parents about his weakness while also asking the student to spend extra time with me every week to get proper math lessons. Needless to say, his parents agreed, and I started my mission to help him understand math as best I could.\n\nIf I remember correctly, I gave him home tutoring for only about 3 months, but his improvement and performance was stunning which showed on his next final examination. In fact, in his next math test, he got 80% mark while his average score was only around 45 in the previous years. After seeing such a huge improvement in the result of their son, the parents of that student gave me very nice feedback.\n\nAnyway, after receiving that huge note of appreciation, I felt really good and proud of my achievement.

Now, everybody in my family knew how much I actually like to wear t-shirts. In fact, a perfect-looking t-shirt, made of cotton fabric, and blue jeans were my staple dress whether I was going to meet my boss in his office for a formal meeting or enjoying some football at a stadium with my friends.\n\nHowever, even though, nobody really had anything against my t-shirt wearing habits, my youngest uncle didn’t really like it that much. Of course, I could understand very well, why he didn’t like me wearing a t-shirt 24/7, and it was because he thought that only juvenile persons would usually like to wear a t-shirt and jeans. But, I was waiting for a big surprise on my 21st birthday when I found out that a beautiful looking, maroon colour t-shirt, made by the world-famous Polo company, was handed to me as a gift by none other than my youngest uncle! Besides, I felt like my uncle actually had read my mind because, in fact, I had looked for such a beautiful t-shirt of that particular colour for a long time. To be honest, that gift was like a “dream come true” to me!\n\nWell, I liked the gift so much because it has a perfect colour. Besides, it was made of 100 per cent, good quality, cotton fabric, so naturally, it was very comfortable to wear. Finally, the gift was so special to me because it was presented to me by a person who always had underestimated my preference in dress, especially, my preference for wearing a t-shirt."

And I really want to meet this person in person and spend some time with him.\n\nThis successful business magnet, who showed up on the TV on that night, is a bit different from most others because he seemed a bit too young to me to be such a successful businessman. But, as the interview kept rolling, a lot of information about him started to come into the light. Of course, I already knew a little about that person by reading some business magazines and newspapers, but the interview was an eye-opener for me since it proved how a person of such a humble background could reach the pinnacle of financial success within such a short period of time.\n\nIn fact, the person had almost nothing when he started his fruit selling business at a street corner about 12 years ago when he was only about 22 years old. Today, with more than 150 acres of different kinds of fruits gardens and one of the largest juice manufacturing companies on his name, the 34 years old business wizard has proved himself to be one of the most promising young business persons of an entire continent. So, how exactly did he manage to become such a successful entrepreneur at such a young age? Well, the answer, according to him, is that he always dreamt big even if his family was one of the poorest in the town.\n\nNeedless to say, I have always wanted to meet him for as long as I have known him from TV and newspapers. And I also did want to spend some time with him right after finishing watching his interview, and I wanted to meet him, not because of his enviable financial success, but because of his positive attitude. I would like to meet him also because I want to ask him about how possibly a person of such a humble background, with no financial backing and formal education, could dream such big at such an early age and finally prove out to achieve them."

But, after reading it, I couldn’t really make much of the message since all it said was “a surprise is waiting for you”. So, I decided to call my boss and sought some clarification about the text message. In response, my boss sounded very happy on the other end and told me that I was getting transferred to another department after getting a promotion.\n\nInitially, after hearing the news, I thought that my boss was joking with me since he had a habit of cracking jokes at his subordinates from time to time, but that time, he made it clear that he wasn’t making any joke.\n\nAnyway, the message was really important for me because the promotion was long overdue. In fact, I was even thinking about quitting from the company if I didn’t get the promotion after working at the same company really hard for more than 6 years.

So, anyway, today I would like to talk about one of those many things that made me excited immensely, and it was when I got my first job about 10 years ago.\n\nBack then, I had just finished my university study and came back to my hometown in order to live with my parents up until I found a job. Of course, my parents were not exactly in a hurry like me, as far as finding a job was concerned since they rather wanted me to stay with them and start some kind of business instead of finding a job. But, I wanted to get a job in a big city and leave my little, old town.\n\nSo, I started to apply for jobs, one after another, but soon I realized that getting a decent job wasn’t exactly a very easy thing. But, I didn’t want to give up on my mission of looking for a job. So, for the next 8/9 months, all I did was to search for new jobs everywhere and apply for them. Then, one day, I got an interview call from one of the prestigious accounting firms of my country, and that too was from a town which wasn’t too far away from me. Then, the life-changing moment arrived one day when I got an interview call from one of the renowned accounting firms of my country and was offered a job on the spot.\n\nIt was one of the most exciting moments of my life, but unfortunately, there was nobody with me then to share the excitement.\n\nAnyway, I was so excited because it opened up many windows of opportunities that were lying ahead of my life. I was thrilled also because it would allow me to move out of my little town and explore the world a little on my own. Finally, needless to say, the prospect of earning a lot of money in the future was also something which excited me after getting my first job."

    "Answer": "We have to go to different places because we have many needs in our life. Of course, not all those travels and journeys require planning in advance. Rather, it’s the only important journeys which require planning in advance, and today, I would like to talk about one such important journey which was delayed even after enough proper planning.\n\nThe journey, I wanted to take, was to attend the graduation ceremony of one of my nephews about a few years ago. By the way, my nephew and I have a very close bond. In fact, it was because of my advice that my nephew chose to study engineering, and he told me that his graduation ceremony would remain incomplete if I didn’t attend his graduation ceremony. So, attending that graduation ceremony had great emotional value to me. Besides, I also didn’t want to miss that once-in-a-lifetime-event of my nephew.\n\nSo, I made all the plans in advance as to what kind of transportation I would use, and when I would need to arrive at the destination. But, despite those plans in advance, I couldn’t exactly arrive at the destination on time because of the events that were not within my control. In fact, the journey was delayed because I was not able to get a taxi on time. And, the reason for which I couldn’t catch a taxi on time was that I needed to see one of my close friends at a hospital, who got injured in a terrible accident on the same day. Thankfully, my friend survived the crash, but my journey was delayed.\n\nNeedless to say, I felt a bit disappointed after my journey was delayed. But, even though, it was delayed, I felt a little relief at the same time, knowing that the delay happened because of a valid cause. I also felt that my nephew wouldn’t mind that little delay because of the same reason. Besides, I felt confident that I could still attend at least a part of the graduation ceremony if I had tried to arrive at my destination by using some different routes."

    "Answer": "People make mistake. But, the burden of such mistakes doesn’t weigh too much on the mistaking persons if they sincerely apologize to the affected persons. Today, I would like to talk about one of those sincere persons who apologized to me about a few months ago.\n\nHe was a Cashier of a super shop – a super shop which I have been visiting quite frequently for the last couple of years or so. But, the cashier, I am talking about, was a newcomer since I saw him for the first time on that day eventful day when I bought a lot of groceries. In fact, that new cashier checked me out on that day. However, interestingly, when I made the payment to the cashier, I felt like I was paying little extra than what I normally used to pay for roughly the same quantity of merchandises on the previous occasions. But, I chose to keep quiet, thinking that perhaps I bought some additional merchandise items, or the prices of some of the grocery items had changed. So, I just took my grocery and left the shop.\n\nBut, after reaching my home, I became a bit too curious and checked the prices of my grocery items. Suddenly, I noticed that one of the merchandises was over-priced on the receipt which was handed to me by the cashier before leaving his shop. Luckily, the super shop was not far away from my home. So, I went back to the cashier the next day in a relaxed mood and told him about the wrong price, he charged me for one of my grocery items. After learning his mistake, he immediately apologized to me very sincerely, telling me that he had just started his new job on that day.\n\nAnyway, to be honest, I wasn’t exactly expecting him to apologize to me like that since it was not such a big deal to me. Besides, I knew it very well that this kind of mistake could happen, especially, by a person who was new at his job. Nevertheless, I felt glad that he actually apologized to me."

    "Answer": "I have always thought of myself as a good team player, and I have learnt it by playing different kinds of roles in different kinds of teams in the past. Today, I would like to share my experience as a team member of one of those teams.\n\nAnyway, I had this experience, as a team member, when I was attending my high school, and when I was a member of my high school debate team. By the way, apart from me, 3 other members of my high school were included in that debate team. Even though we were not of the same age, we managed to build up a good rapport among ourselves since we all knew about our roles and responsibilities in the team. Besides, we all knew our strengths and weakness of ourselves as far as our individual contribution in the debate was concerned.\n\nAnyway, the captain of the debate team assigned me mainly to note down the critical and important points, discussed by the opposition debate team, for the purpose of refuting their argument.  Apart from that, I was also assigned to summarise my team’s case by listing different important points of all of my team members, including my points as well as that of my captain. Finally, I was also responsible to assist my team captain in finding out the bad or controversial facts of the opposition debate team so that he could order the facts of our team in sequence in order to support the theme of our debate.\n\nAnyway, being a team of that debate team has helped me greatly in my professional life by making me calm and confident during adverse condition. Besides, it also has helped me learn how to separate facts from fiction without being biased. Needless to say, being a member of the debate team has also helped become a reasonably confident public speaker. Finally, becoming a debate team member in the past has also taught me about how to coordinate nicely with each other in a team setting without imposing my views on the other team members."

    "Answer": "I try to avoid visiting crowded public places, unless I have an important reason for that, mainly because I don’t really like noises. But, apparently, some of my close friends didn’t really care about what I liked or didn’t like when they took me to a live musical concert about a few years ago.\n\nNow, please don’t think that I don’t like music or musical concert because I seldom miss a chance to see a musical concert on television. Besides, I also watch different kinds of music concert videos by using resources on the internet. But, some of my good friends thought that it was time for me to change myself and attend a live musical concert instead of just watching them on television and online.\n\nAnyway, initially I thought that I would somehow be able to bypass the request of my friends on that occasion also like on previous occasions, but they seemed really persistent on that occasion. In fact, to get me motivated to visit with them, they even arranged the money to buy the concert ticket themselves for me instead of having me to pay for it. Besides, they also told me that they were going to play some of my all-time favourite music. So, I had no other choice but to go with them and enjoy the concert for the sake of friendship.\n\nBy the way, it was an open-air concert in a big stadium where thousands of music lovers were able to accommodate themselves, and I felt like I was lost in the ocean of crowd after arriving there.\n\nAnyway, after visiting that crowded musical concert, initially, I felt happy because the music there was really nice. But, as more time passed, and as more and more fans came to the concert, I could hardly listen to the music anymore because of the deafening noises of the chorus music of the fans there. On top of that, I got a bit tired after keeping myself on my feet for a long time since there was hardly any space for sitting."

    "Answer": "We have to make a lot of decisions almost regularly to adjust to the changing circumstances of our life. Needless to say, not all of these decisions change our lives the way we expect them to. But, today, I would like to talk about a decision, taken by someone I know, which changed his life as expected.\n\nThe person, I am talking about, was none other than one of my own cousins. To describe my cousin, the first thing, which I should tell about him, is that I have known him to a very restless person. In other words, he always used to keep changing his mind. For example, if he liked a certain shirt one day, he wouldn’t like it the very next day. So, my uncle and aunt (the parents of my cousin) were a bit worried about his mind-changing habit because they thought that the habit would affect his future life and career.\n\nBut, somewhere deep inside my mind, I knew that my cousin was smart enough to make the right decisions at the right time when it would really matter, and I was proved right by my cousin when he took a decision about moving to a bigger city and stuck to it. Yes, moving to a bigger city was a game-changer and a good decision for my cousin because it was there where he managed to meet a group of brave entrepreneurs. The particular group of entrepreneurs, he met, was involved with different kinds of export and import business. As, my cousin started to do business with them with his rather limited capital, soon thereafter, he began to make a lot of profits. In fact, he became a millionaire within a few years.\n\nAnyway, moving to a bigger city change the life of my cousin because he finally found what he liked, and he liked making money. Besides, the decision also made him a more thoughtful and responsible person, which was missing from his life, when he was living with his parents in a small city. All in all, I am happy that my cousin took that life-changing decision."

    "Answer": "I am not sure if living nearby the main road has its advantage, but it sure has a major disadvantage, and that distance is to deal with noise – a lot of noise – on a regular basis. So, I guess that I will go ahead today and talk about the noise of the traffic on the road near the place where I live.\n\nAnyway, I guess that in today’s world, there aren’t too many people who don’t know about traffic noise, especially, if they live in the cities. And, we all know how busy the city roads and streets can become, with hundreds of vehicles running on them every minute and making some unbearable noises. These noises are mainly created from the traction of the road surfaces by tires, loud sounds of engine/transmission, aerodynamic noises (noises that result from the flow of air and vibration), horns, and braking elements. However, of all the noises, noises of rolling tires from large vehicles, like buses and trucks, driving on the uneven pavement are found to be the biggest contributor of traffic noise which increases with higher vehicle speeds.\n\nThese traffic noises are bad and harmful enough to cause sleep problems, tiredness, headaches, high blood pressure, hormonal effects, stress and increased risk of heart disease.  Anyway, the traffic noise is usually unpleasant and inconvenient as they distract us and confuse us. But, no matter how unpleasant and inconvenient the traffic noises really are, we can’t really get rid of them at will because it’s the very sound of motion energy, created by the fuel and engine, without which, no vehicles would run on the road.  \n\nAnyway, I have a lot of negative feelings about this traffic noise, but the most frustrating about this traffic noise is that I feel very helpless against it, simply because I feel like this traffic noise is inevitable and a fact of life which we will have to live with as long as we are living in a city. Even more frustrating for me is the fact that we all more or less know what this traffic noise does to our health, but still, we are doing almost nothing about it."

    "Answer": "I live in a rather quiet and small town, and nothing much really happens in it except some occasional bird watching (yes, many foreign birds visit it) and spending some lazy times in some local café and restaurants. Luckily, however, there is a local newspaper in my town for us to read, which provides us with local news about what happens in and around our town. So, today, I would like to talk about one such news which the local people are really interested in.\n\nThe news is about establishing a new train station in our little town, which the local people in my town had been demanding for, since the days of my childhood. Anyway, I would have missed this exciting news had one of my cousins not informed me about it. So, I immediately got a newspaper and started to read each and every word of the news, lest I missed something.\n\nThe news said many things about the future train station in my town, including how long it would take to build the train station, and how many trains would stop in that station. The news also highlighted the facts about how the local residents of my town would benefit from this railway station. In fact, many of us in our town believe that because of this train station, communication between our town and other major cities of my country would be easier, which would, in turn, increase the economic activities of our town. And, the more economic activities it has, the better would be the future employment opportunities. Besides, because of this new train station, people in my town would gain more other than just economic development from the contact with the rest of the country.\n\nAnyway, people in my area are interested in this news, mainly because they would not feel stuck in some isolated part of their country. Besides, they also feel that it would open up many doors of opportunities for them as far as their educational, cultural and economic developments are concerned. All in all, it is a piece of great news."

    "Answer": "I never really underestimated the importance of learning to speak in a different language other than my native language. But, the importance of it increased even more to me when I actually had to use a foreign language in a critical situation.\n\nThe critical situation, I am talking about, involved talking to an immigration officer at an airport when I visited Spain about a year ago for enjoying a vacation.\n\nUp until that point, I never really thought that I would need to use a foreign language other than English at an airport, at least. But, I was in for a surprise, after arriving at one of the major international airports, when a makeshift immigration officer greeted me and started to ask me different kind of questions in broken English. By the way, I didn’t realize that the gentleman was a makeshift immigration officer until I found out that I was waiting unusually long at the immigration checkpoint to get all my paper works done. Besides, he also told me that he was filling in for a certain gentleman.  \n\nSo, anyway, after I found out that the makeshift immigration officer was struggling to communicate with me in his broken English, I thought that it was probably the right time to be little bold and use the Spanish language for the first time in a formal set up which I learned at my high school. Seeing me speaking in his mother tongue, the immigration officer gentleman first looked a bit surprised and then excited with a very happy face, asking me how I learned his language and what possibly could have motivated me to learn a difficult language like Spanish. I tried to answer all of his questions in the Spanish language before leaving the airport happily.\n\nAnyway, I chose to use a foreign language on this occasion, primarily because I wanted to see how good I was in communicating in the Spanish language. Besides, I also wanted to help the makeshift immigration officer to ease up a little and feel comfortable when trying to communicate with me in English."

    "Answer": "Waiting for someone is bad enough as it is, but, it is even worse when you have to wait a long time for somebody to arrive while trying to keep yourself up and awake. But, that’s just exactly what I had to do – that is to stay awake and wait while feeling sleepy – about a year ago at one of my cousin’s home in my hometown.\n\nHowever, up until that way, I never really thought that I would have a problem keeping myself awake, no matter what the situation was. But, I was proved wrong when my cousin and his wife asked me to look after their 4 years old kid as they were going out of the town for an important job. Needless to say, I gladly agreed to their request, but little did I know then that their 4 years old was so handful and difficult to reason with.\n\nOf course, the first couple of hours were ok, but as more time started to pass, the little 4-year-old boy got restless. In fact, he started to run all over the place in his house while playing with virtually everything there. Soon, I realized that I was not strong and energetic enough to keep up with that little boy. Anyway, things went like this for about a few hours and then suddenly I started to feel sleepy. I guess that I was getting tired, trying to run after that boy every now and then during that busy evening. But, at around 11 pm, I felt like I couldn’t keep myself awake any longer, but I couldn’t leave the little unruly 4 years old alone either. Another hour had gone by like this until my cousin and his wife arrived to rescue me out of my misery.\n\nI tried to keep myself awake on that night by watching some TV programme. But when watching TV was not working, I tried to wash my eyes with some cold water to keep myself awake. Sometimes, I was doing some light exercises to keep my eyes opened while also playing with the little boy at the same time."

    "Answer": "I never really thought that an indoor game could be as exciting as playing a game in the outdoor, and so I never really showed that much interest in it. But, one day about a couple of years ago, when one of my friends insisted that playing indoor table tennis was going to be really fun, I thought that it was worth giving a try.\n\nAnyway, my friend knew it very well that I have always loved playing table tennis. In fact, I even used to be champion sometimes when playing in inter-school table tennis tournament back in the days as a high school student. But, as I started my university years and then entered into the professional world, I started to distance myself from all kinds of leisure activities, including table tennis. Besides, finding a suitable table tennis playing partner wasn’t really that easy either, especially, when you are moving to new places and live there for professional reasons.\n\nSo, for a while, I thought that I had almost lost my touch with my favourite sport until my friend one day told me that I could practice playing table tennis at an indoor facility which was not too far away from where I lived. Besides, there was an extra incentive to go and play table tennis in that indoor facility as the indoor facility authority was offering a specially-designed t-shirt to every table tennis player. Apparently, they were trying to make the indoor table tennis popular among the general population. So, finally, I did go to that indoor facility and played my favourite game with a couple of amateur players who impressed and surprised me with their table tennis skills. \n\nAnyway, I must say that I enjoyed playing that indoor game a lot since we won against a couple of amateur players. Besides, it also allowed me to meet some arising table tennis stars in my country and learned important tips about table tennis from them. Besides, I also liked the fact that I was given a couple of nice t-shirts because of taking part in that game and winning it."

I am lucky that I have one of those active families who never hesitate to enjoy different leisure activities whenever an opportunity arrives.\n\nOne such leisure activity, which my family really enjoys, is fishing, and I have seen my family doing fishing since the days I barely began to understand the world around me. Sometimes, I feel that fishing is in the blood of all of my family members, including me and my elder brother, since we all happen to like it so much.\n\nIn fact, we are so passionate about fishing that we have more have than 50 years old fishing rods in our house which were used by my father to do fishing when he himself was a child. My mother doesn’t lag too far behind either in the race of being passionate about her fishing hobby because she doesn’t only do fishing by herself but also she takes pictures of herself and the entire family when we are fishing. We love fishing so much that we actually carry all kinds of foods with us, when going fishing, in case if we have to spend the whole day to catch our preys.\n\nAnyway, as I have already mentioned above that we all in our like fishing whenever there is an opportunity, but we prefer to do it over the long weekend when we don’t have any urgent matters to take care of.\n\nWell, this particular type of leisure activity is really helpful for me and my family since nothing else brings us together as close as when going fishing.  Besides, the fun and joy of catching live fishes and then eating them over dinner time just can’t be described in words.

Frankly speaking, I think that it was one of the best hotels in a very serene environment, in which I have ever stayed, and today I would like to talk about it here.\n\nAnyway, Located in the Dusit district of Bangkok, little more than 8 kilometres away from Bangkok downtown, this stunningly-beautiful looking, private urban sanctuary sits on 3 acres of a lush garden and by one of the famous rivers of Bangkok. Easily being considered as one of the best heritage-style, luxury hotels in Bangkok, it has all the ingredients to “awe-inspire” the guests with its marvellous antiques and decoration.  \n\nTaking elegance to the extreme, this hotel offers plenty of panache with its silent marble corridors, arranged around a central courtyard under glass with some incredible vegetation and plenty of natural light. With about 40 spacious rooms, this vast property is scattered with pieces from the owners' art collection, including breathtaking wooden Buddha statues from 16th century, and has everything from an infinity pool to multiple dining venues to a library, cinema, gym, and spa -- while maintaining an intimate vibe. Secluded Villas offer private pools, hot tubs, and rooftop terraces.\n\nAll rooms include breakfast, butler service, and free long-tail boat service along the river. Besides, its huge public area, and enormous banana trees, surrounding its water pond on three stories high atrium, would make one feel like he or she is in a huge garden.\n\nAnyway, I think that this is one of the nicest hotels, I have ever seen and where I have stayed. One of the best features of this hotel is that it has made sure for all of its guests have plenty of space around them so that they never feel congested. Another remarkable aspect of this hotel is that every element in it, including the art pieces, decoration and design, feels like they all are the functional parts of the overall design of this luxury retreat."

But, luckily, I got a rare free weekend about a few months ago when I really enjoyed my time.\n\nBut, before I tell you what I really did during that weekend, or how I enjoyed it, let me first tell you how I really had managed to get that free weekend, even though, I was very much scheduled to work during that weekend. But, things got little interesting when I received a call from one of my co-workers, just the evening before the weekend, in which, he told me that he was going to fill in for me on that weekend. When I asked, why he would want to work for me on that weekend, he simply told me that it would allow him the opportunity to stay away from his “mother-in-law” who was coming to visit his wife on that weekend. Needless to say, I didn’t say a word after learning the reason from my co-worker because I also know how difficult the “mother-in-laws” can really be sometimes.\n\nAnyway, I did everything, I could, to enjoy the weekend, which included visiting some of my close relatives who I hadn’t seen in a long time. I also watched some of my favourite and old movies with my family. Apart from that, I spent a whole afternoon doing some shopping in order to buy myself some fashionable and trendy clothes. All in all, it was a terrific weekend for me.\n\nI remember this weekend, mainly because it allowed me to spend some quality times with my family members and relatives in a very relaxing mood which happens with me only on some rare occasions.

And it was so because it was only the second time that I visited the city. The first time, I visited it, was almost 7 or 8 years ago when things looked a bit different in that very crowded and big city. For example, the streets got wider and many new shops and buildings were built.\n\nBesides, some of the businesses and shops moved to new locations as well which I had no idea about. Of course, none of these would create any problem for me unless my aunt had asked me to buy her medicine (she was an asthma patient, and she used an inhaler of a certain foreign brand which only a certain pharmacy in the city used to keep) from a particular pharmacy. I knew where the pharmacy was located, or at least so I had thought since I visited the last time when I had come to see my aunt.\n\nBut, when I actually went to that location, I found out that the pharmacy had moved to a new location. I asked a few people there, but unfortunately, nobody could tell me about it. Seeing no other options, I decided to get the help of internet on my smartphone even though, I was a bit sceptical about it. But, luckily, as soon as I searched the pharmacy by its name on my phone, it did give me its address and the direction.\n\nAnyway, after finding the location of the pharmacy, I breathed a sigh of relief. After all, I didn’t want my aunt to suffer because of my failure to find some pharmacy and buy her medicine. Besides, I felt a bit more confident and bold also in roaming around the city since I had the help of the internet."

It is a great topic, and thank you for allowing me the opportunity to talk something on it.\n\nAnyway, the volunteer work, I want to talk about here, was a work which was aimed at helping the poor and needy children at a children’s hospital in our city.\n\nPrior to that, I had taken part in some other volunteer works, like donating our old books to our local libraries and preparing soups for the poor and elderly adults of our town, but never really knew anything about how to help the children up and until that point. So, when our school supervisor asked us to buy some oranges from the local market, we just didn’t have any idea about what we were exactly going to do with those oranges.\n\nSome of us, of course, had thought that we were going to give those oranges to those poor children at the hospital, but when we were ordered to make juice from those oranges, we didn’t bother to guess anymore. However, soon, it became clear to us that we were going to sell the orange juice and then buy some really nice gifts for the children with the money of selling the orange juice.\n\nBy the way, I decided to volunteer for the work at that time, mainly because I got real bored of my studies and some tough homework, and taking part in that volunteer works provided me with a perfect escape from that. Besides, I love to help needy people and that volunteer work gave me a perfect opportunity to do so.  \n\nAnyway, I felt really glad and happy to have the opportunity to take part in that volunteer work, mainly because it allowed me to see some smile on the faces of some innocent children which was just priceless.

    "Answer": "No doubt, there are so many sophisticated eCommerce websites on the internet, but choosing one of them can be a bit tricky since we would never know if they are really that much reliable or trustworthy except, of course, we are talking about amazon.com.\n\nNow, I think that there are very few people, using the internet to buy things, who don’t know about Amazon eCommerce website. But, still, to repeat, it is the world’s largest online retailer, manufacturer of electronic book readers and web service provider that has become the iconic example of e-commerce (electronic commerce) industry all over the world.\n\nBeing founded in the year of 1994, amazon.com has actually revolutionized the way the business is done on the internet by incorporating the latest technologies on its website to the best possible effects. And I realized this, again, when I went to buy an E-book reader from their website about a few months ago for my 14 years old cousin.\n\nBy the way, the E-book reader, I bought, is the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, which, without a doubt, probably is right for all kinds of users. And it didn’t even cost me that much money even though, this sharp 6-inch device is packed with 8 GB of storage and 300-PPI backlit display. So, in the end, it was quite a deal for me, as I didn’t have to look anywhere else for what I was exactly looking for. But, the best thing was that it probably took me only about 5 to 7 minutes to finish the whole process of finding my E-book reader and the paying for it.\n\nAnyway, what I really liked about amazon.com was that the website actually allows its customers to personalize and filter the product information based on their (the customers) taste and preferences. Besides, I was also very impressed with the way the website managed to organize its navigational features in such a simplified manner (especially, for such a “gigantic” online retailer) so that the customers don’t feel lost when searching for their products."
