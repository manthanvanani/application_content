I have learned from a colleague that you will conduct an Electrocardiogram Training in Singapore. I am writing to ask for some specific information regarding the seminar schedule, program details, accommodation arrangement and the cost.\n\nFirstly, with regards to dates and time, what will be the seminar schedule and what time would it begin and end each day? Secondly, please notify me of the topics and speakers of the program. I am wondering if there is any special consideration for the registered nurses who will be attending the seminar? And finally, I would also like to know about the accommodation and the cost. Would the accommodation be arranged by you or should an individual be responsible for that? What would be the approximate cost to attend and successfully finish the seminar?\n\nI am very much interested in attending the seminar and your reply would help me plan for it in advance. So, I am looking forward to hearing from you soon regarding my concerns.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRona Olivar"

I have learned about your seminar on Ethical Hacking, scheduled to be held in Sydney, Australia in December 2018, through an advertisement in a newspaper. I am planning to attend this workshop and need some further details.\n\nThe seminar schedule was not mentioned in the advert. Hence, I would like to know the duration and schedule of the workshop. I would be glad if you can also give me a brief of the program: which aspects of Ethical Hacking will be covered as part of the workshop and if there will be any hands-on or will it be just a theoretical session. Please inform me how much it would cost to book my seat. Lastly, as I will be travelling from India, I would like to know about the accommodation arrangement. Is there any living place provided by you? If not, could you please let me know of the hotels nearby along with the probable cost per night including meals?\n\n\nThank you in advance for your reply.

I am hoping that you would take actions to improve your food quality and maintain your reputation.\n\nRecently, I have been promoted to the Senior Internal Auditor in my office and to celebrate this event, I took my family out to one of your outlets on Madison Avenue. We ordered four servings of shrimp fried rice, but we were shocked to discover that the shrimp in our serving was undercooked and had a pungent odour. After complaining about it to the supervisor, we were told that the restaurant had run out of shrimps - not a valid excuse for a distinguished restaurant like yours. You can understand my frustration when my family and I had to leave the restaurant empty stomach and disappointment.\n\nMy intention in writing this letter is to ask you to issue a \"show cause notice\" to the supervisor at your restaurant, and disseminate instructions to all your staff to hold a modicum of buffer stock for every item, just in case the restaurant runs out of that item and so that no customer experiences a humiliation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMuhammad Sameed"

But the whole event was ruined due to the dishes we were served.\n\nI suppose you can imagine our disappointment when we found the onion soup absolutely inedible. It was cold, and it appeared your chef did not stir it well while cooking. Some clogs of flour were visible in the soup. Moreover, the main course was cold and not up to our expectation.

We asked a waitress about the reasons and she had no plausible excuse for that.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing that you have taken the necessary steps to maintain your reputation and food quality.

It was supposed to be a happy and memorable night because we were commemorating a special event as a family in one of our favourite restaurants. But we have had a frustrating experience.\n\nWe ordered lamb steak, spuds and toasted sandwiches as our main course, but the steak was salty, raw and hard. On top of that, our sandwiches were served cold! Though we complained about our food to the waitress, she did not mind us and instead told us to complain to the manager. The ice-cream that we ordered came without any marshmallow and strawberry on top, despite their mention in the menu.

But, last night it was a big disappointment. I had my table booked well in advance but it was allocated to someone else, which is not acceptable as it hurts customers' faith in your service.\n\nMoreover, the meal was less than average. The first course of sea trout was tasteless and salty. We mentioned that the duck was undercooked but no comment or apology was made at the time. To add more grief, my wife's duck had a large piece of gristle in it which was a shame. Besides, our steward was not very effusive or communicative, and he appeared to be going through the motions as quickly as possible.\n\nI am a regular customer of your restaurant and if this is what you are going to continue in future, then I will have to find a different place for family occasions.

After we inquired about it, one of your attendants told that they keep it off one hour after marinating with chilli powder with some other ingredients.

Unfortunately, the person who is supposed to come at 7:30 pm sharp does not show up until 10.00 pm.   \n\nMoreover, my supervisor forces me to work on Fridays, which according to my job contract is not mandatory. Although I had managed to work on Friday until the last week by missing a few lectures at college, it seems unmanageable in the future as this will affect my studies.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you could talk to our supervisor about these problems and offer me a solution as early as possible. Otherwise, I would have to quit the job, even though I enjoy my work and love working for your company.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRiya Nagpal"

So far I have been enjoying my work but some issues have raised that need your interference to resolve. I am hoping that you would help me work even more efficiently by solving them.  \n\nI joined your company on 20th September as a part-timer and gaining experience and supporting my university tuition were my reasons to take a job.

I decided to take the job in order to gain some practical experience as a law student but I am afraid some problems deter me to work properly, which is affecting me personally.\n\nI understand the job requires me to fill in a minimum of 3 affidavits each day in accordance with the files given by our solicitors. The problem is that the solicitors cannot hand in the files on time. I was told that I should get the files before 10 each morning, but in reality, I never have them before lunch, that is, 1.00 pm. As a consequence, I have to stay up until 10.00 pm almost every day to finish my daily work.\n\nSince in theory, our solicitors are supposed to complete their files the day before, I am wondering if it is possible for you to ask them to hand in the files a little bit earlier. I live far away from our firm and have classes from 6.30 in the morning, so working up to 10.00 pm is troublesome for me.

I took the job to finish my internship - which is a requirement to complete my Bachelor degree. However, some challenges are impeding our work performance and I need your help to solve them.\n\nDuring this short span of my work, I have noticed some problems that are obstacles to the overall progress of the company. To start with, I help other data analysts with different data from various sources as per the requirement. I have to collect the same data many times. The main reason behind this redundant work is the lack of MIS reporting software and a solid database system. We can avail many benefits by using that type of software. It would both ensure better performance of employees and data security.\n\nMoreover, we have to take our lunch outside and this kills our valuable time. Lunch arrange by the office would ensure hygienic meals, and save our time which we could better utilise in the office.\n\nTherefore, I request you to implement MIS software for our office, which would be a really prudent investment in the long run. Besides, please arrange lunch for the employees as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSafayet Ullah"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am a regular customer of your store and have found all my interactions with your office very satisfactory. But, I am sorry to say that the service I received last week, to have my personal computer repaired, was not as per your excellence. I am hoping that you would rectify the issue to keep your reputation intact.\n\nFirst of all, the front desk technician was not available at the time of our prescheduled appointment. I had to wait 45 minutes for him to appear. However, this was just the beginning of the poor service I experience yesterday. He did not seem to have enough understanding of the computer hardware and Linux operating system and it took me 30 minutes to explain the problem and then he accepted my computer for the warranty. On 19th November, when I collected my computer, I noticed that the invoice includes the cost of the keypad replacement! I never lodged a request to change the keyboard!\n\nI request you to look into this matter and remove the keyboard replacement charge from the invoice. Also, appoint technically sound personnel to your service team as they represent your company.\n\n I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRamanuj Sharma"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI took my computer to your repair shop recently and I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the repair work your technician did on my computer’s heatsink. I suggest they should properly diagnose the problems before fixing any computer and charging money to a customer.\n\nI took my computer to your store on 07th December because of an overheating issue with it. After careful inspections, one of your technicians determined the problem to be an old heatsink that could no longer keep the processor cool. I was told that the problem will be fixed and that my computer will no longer heat up. I paid $80 for the repair work and another $35 for a new heatsink.\n\nHowever, when I brought the computer home, the problem still persisted, and my computer was heating up even more than before. You can understand my shock when I realised that I travelled 10 miles and paid your store $115 for nothing.\n\nMy intention in writing this letter is to ask you to install a brand new heatsink- that can keep the processor cool, at no extra charge. I can come by and bring my computer on Monday morning if it suits you.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSameed Qureshi"

In the letter, you stated that I am $240 overdrawn and due to this, I will be charged $70 which would be deducted from my savings account. I can assure you that I have not overdrawn any amount and it must be a mistake from the bank's end which you must scrutinise before imposing on me the overdrawn charge.\n\nAs you know, for the last eleven months, I have been paying $300 monthly instalment for a car loan that I took from your bank. The monthly instalments are taken directly from my savings account. However, last month I paid the outstanding amount of the loan and settled it with the bank. I even wrote to the bank instructing that I have fully paid my car loan. I received a letter from you acknowledging my request, but, for some reason, nothing was done about it. Another $300 instalment has been paid to the loan this month and this is the reason I am shown overdrawn in my statement. I am attaching the statement with this letter.\n\nNo doubt this is a mistake you should correct immediately. I would like you to reverse the transaction and stop the monthly instalment payment from my savings account as the loan amount has already been settled.\n\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSandra Roll"

It was a peaceful locality up until recently. The situation deteriorated, perhaps because some new families settled in here lately who have teenage children who they have no control over. These youngsters all have untrained bulldogs who accompany them all the time. The cause of concern is that they often let the dogs go free and run behind them as if they are competing. This creates fear and terror among other well-disposed residents. On the contrary, they misbehave with elderly and use offensive words in the open streets.\n\nIn this worrisome and tensed situation, I would expect you to take proper actions to restore the peacefulness in the neighbourhood.

I am hoping you would take actions before somebody gets hurt.  \n\nRecently, I have witnessed that a few adolescences own dogs who are on the loose in the neighbourhood.

Many freely run dogs are intimidating, especially to children and the elderly. I am afraid that it’s just a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured.\n\nThe owners of these dogs, a bunch of adolescents, seem to be unaware of the dangers of letting their pets off the leash and have adopted a nonchalant attitude.

I have reserved this vehicle till 14th March and require it for some important tasks. Hence I sincerely request you to arrange another car for me. I shall be very thankful to you.\n\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPooja Gupta"

I am writing to apprise you of a minor accident that involved that car. I am hoping you would take necessary actions regarding this.\n\nI have hired this car for a family holiday in Mysore, but unfortunately, the automobile was involved in a small accident yesterday. As it was dark and in the absence of street light, I could not notice an open and large pothole on the road on time and applied the brake suddenly. Due to this, the car behind collided with my car. Although there was no major damage, only the light on the left-hand side was broken and had a small dent.\n\nThough I have got the light and dent fixed at a Maruti authorised service station, but the small scratches are still visible. Please accept my sincere apologies. I am willing to pay some extra charges as compensation if required. You can send me the final bill to my address and I shall clear all dues within next week.\n\nPlease feel free to call me, in case any further information is required.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPreeti Ghuraiya"

Later we called the police and the incident was reported accordingly.\n\nIn the meantime, I sent the vehicle to a repair shop for repairing. I obviously will bear all the costs.

I would like to take you there and show how this part of the city is different than the rest.\n\nRecently, I, along with a group of people, visited a slum area as part of social activity. This slum is situated in a distant place, away from the city outskirts and could be reached on foot only. Upon entering the area, I was surprised by the children who were ready to welcome us; they were eagerly waiting that someone would bring something for them to eat. We spent about 4 hours by playing games, explained them the importance of personal hygiene, taught them few important social aspects, gave them food which we took along with us and at the end of the session we distributed around 30 winter blankets for each family in the slum. When we were in the midst of the slum, I personally saw and felt their poverty, their longing for help and need for social awareness. When we were leaving, I was so happy to see the smiles on their faces.\n\nThe trip to the slum infused me of an idea to gather a few more and ask them for their help in supporting the slum dwellers.

I have already started feeling exhilarated and can’t wait to meet you in person.\n\nHowever, I learnt from your letter that you would probably land at Delhi Airport at around 7:00 in the evening. Regrettably, due to an important exam for my MBA course, I’ll not be able to catch up with you on time. My exam would end at 07:30 hours and I would drive to the airport afterwards. I’ll probably reach the airport by 9:00 pm considering the heavy traffic in the evening. Please wait for me at the airport lounge until then and wander around the lounge to kill the time. You can grab some snacks and coffee from the canteen.\n\nFor your information, I’ll be wearing a red jacket with blue stripes on the back which you gifted me on my twenty-fifth birthday.\n\nHave a safe journey.

I am writing to inform you that the room heating was ineffectual and despite a great location and friendly staff, I have had a bad experience staying at your hotel. I am hoping you would repair the central heating system so that no guest suffers due to the extreme weather.\n\nI stayed at your hotel from 25th May till 27th May and had an excruciating experience as your heating system in my room did not work as expected. The temperature in the city was somewhat unexpected and fell below 7° Celcius during this period. When I found that the room temperature was not comfortable, I called the front desk executive and despite his promise, nothing was done.  \n\nBecause of the extreme cold in the room, I had to wear socks and a knit hat, take an additional blanket and put on the electric stove all night. Consequently, I got very little sleep over the three nights.\n\nI think it would be a good idea to repair the central heating system and be prepared for unusual weather. A room heating system for each room along with the central heating system in the winter would certainly make the rooms more comfortable. Perhaps you would consider giving me a discount if I stay at your hotel next time.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWalker Luise"

Last week, I purchased a dress from your store and unfortunately, it was faulty. When I returned it to your store for a replacement, I was told that it is not possible.\n\nI bought a white trendy top from your store on 16th April. When I tried it in the shop, it looked alright to me. However, when I showed it to my roommate, I realised that a stain on the back was visible, hence it is not wearable. I believe I was not given the product that I trialled at your store. I went to the store the next day to get it replaced.\n\nTo my utter dismay, the sales assistant mentioned that once an item is sold, it cannot be exchanged or refunded as per the store's policy. I completely understand it. However, it is unfair that a customer has to suffer due to a staff's mistake or dishonesty. I have not removed the price tag from the dress and it is clearly visible that the stain is very old. The order number is WD-52417 and I paid $189 for the item.\n\nI believe this matter deserves your immediate attention. I would appreciate if you could replace the top or refund the money. It would certainly increase my confidence in your customer care services as well.\n\nLooking forward to your prompt action.\n\nNaaz Anna"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nThree days ago I bought a green long-sleeve jumper from your store. I was excited to have a 40% discount on the product but very disappointed to notice that the item was defective. I am hoping you would replace it with a new one or refund me the money.\n\nI bought the jumper from your store on 2nd June and it is medium-sized cotton-made clothing. When I got home, I discovered a small hole in the left sleeve of the jumper. It looks like a rip of some kind and the stitching has unravelled. I visited your shop the next day to ask for an identical replacement. Unfortunately, the stock was not available. Therefore, I asked for a refund. However, the shop assistant refused to give me a refund and said it was against the store policy. It cost me $59.95 and the order number is JB54874520. I am attaching a receipt with this letter.\n\nI am writing to demand a refund or, at the very least, a replacement. The jumper is unwearable as it is and I do not want to buy anything else. I hope that you can assist me in this matter. If I do not hear from you within the next three days, I will be forced to seek legal advice.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAmber Crew"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing this letter to complain about a problem which I find a bit troubling, to say the least.\n\nRecently, I bought a shirt from your store at a discounted price. After taking that shirt home, I found out that it had a tiny hole just under the collar. Now, you might argue that it was my fault since I did not check the shirt carefully before purchasing it. In response, I would just say that it was not actually easy to learn about the tiny hole since it was hidden under the collar.\n\nAnyway, as soon as I found out about the fault, I requested one of your store assistants for a complete return, but I was told that I would not get any refund since it was the store policy not to give any refund on an item which is sold on discount.\n\nSo, in light of this frustrating situation, I would like to request you to please take appropriate action for the sake of your store’s reputation and issue me a full refund for the defected shirt. If I do not hear from you within the next seven days, I will file a written complaint to your head office.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMitch O’Conner"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing regarding a bag that I left on one of your planes last week. On 24th November, I travelled to London on flight FRC- 2547-A  from Sydney. According to my ticket, my seat number was D-5A. The bag contains some important documents which I need immediately. I am hoping you would help me find the lost bag.\n\nAfter I reached my hotel in London, I realised I had left my bag on the plane under the seat in front of me. I felt pretty silly about the mistake. My bag is small in size and is made of brown leather with a zip on the top. Inside the bag, I have put a credit card, a debit card, a book that I was reading titled 'War and Peace' by Leo Tolstoy, some car keys, my mobile phone and some important business documents. I need these documents within a few days and they are very important to me.\n\nI, therefore, request you to have your lost property department check and see if they have my bag and contact me as soon as possible. I can be reached on my mobile phone +0299465467484 or on my email at sharonmond@hotmail.com.\n\nThanking you in advance for your kind cooperation. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSharon Mond"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nLast week, I took one of your direct flights to fly from Kuala Lumpur to London. My flight was on 27th June and the flight number was NR-15478. But, unfortunately, when I left the plane, I left my cross-body bag in it.\n\nHowever, I came to know about the lost bag only after I had arrived at my hotel when I needed to show my reservation documents to the hotel authority. I always hang that men’s bag around my shoulder, but, when I was flying in your aircraft and sat near the block D, I, unfortunately, left it in the overhead locker above the seats. And that’s probably what caused me to forget about the bag.\n\nTo give you some idea about my bag and its contents, it is a brown colour leather bag which is about 10 inches wide, 12 inches long and 6 inch in diameter and is made by Kenneth Cole. The bag contains important documents from my office, copies of my travel documents, as well as personal items like hair clipper (comb), trimmer and an ebook reader.\n\nSo, once you find the bag, please give me a call and then courier it to my office address which is attached on one side of the bag at your earliest convenience. If this is not possible, I can visit your office and collect it myself.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMitchel Moore"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing to you to complain about the Singer-MO3708G microwave oven that I purchased from your shop “kitchen corner” last month. I was excited to have purchased it but disappointed to find that it was poorly made and has manufacturing flaws. I am hoping you would either replace it or refund me the full amount.\n\nThe main problem with the device is that its power system suddenly stops working. This must be a manufacturing fault. At first, I thought it was a connection problem of the power supply so I have it checked by a technician but it was not the case. Then I called your shop and talked to Mr Rex and he assured me that one of your technicians will visit my home within two days. To my utmost dismay, it has been 10 days since the conversation but no one from your shop showed up. The order number is 25254801 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\n\nI am looking for prompt actions from you as I have a valid warranty for the product. Please send someone to replace the faulty product or agree to refund the amount that I have paid for the device.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.

    "answer": "Dear Mr Smith,\n\nI am writing this letter in connection with the non-functional heating system in your house where we currently reside in. The heating system is not working for more than a week and a team of men came to fix it but could not do anything. I am hoping you would call another expert team to have it fixed immediately.\n\nI am a student at the Cherry Blossom school in Brighton and have been residing in your flat with three other roommates for the last eleven months. As per our rental agreement, we reported the issue to your designated workmen first. However, they have failed to fix the problem and have exacerbated the situation by drilling some holes in the bathroom wall, channels and the cold air freeze us in this intense winter.\n\nDue to the non-functional heating system, we are unable to control water temperature, and we are compelled to heat water using gas burners for our daily domestic use. Similarly, we can't control the room temperature and we are living with thick winter clothes donned on our body round the clock. This is highly unpleasant and obnoxious to all of us.\n\nIn order to fix the issue, once and for all, I suggest engaging a better maintenance service agency with more skilled professionals than your current workmen. You can find many such agencies in a newspaper's classified section.\n\nConsidering the severity of the issue, I expect your immediate actions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJonathan Aflex"

Just ensure that he gets 3 meals a day at 6-8 hour interval. Also, let him be outside in the evening whenever possible so that he can play with the ball. Also, don't forget to bathe him preferably every other day so that he doesn't stink.\n\nI know that you will not stay at my house full time so there aren't many chores that you need to do.

I will take you to the Petronas Towers, which was once the tallest building in the world. I also recommend you to try the street food and do some shopping at the Central Market. Life is so vibrant and diverse in this city and  I am sure you will enjoy it all.\n\nAfter you spend a few days in Kuala Lumpur, you should spend some time at Penang and Langkawi. While the formal is a state and known as the Pearl of the Orient and my personal favourite, the latter is a district and an archipelago of 104 islands in the Andaman Sea.\n\nWe have a hot and humid climate year-round, interspersed with tropical rain showers. The temperature is between 26-36-degree Celsius now and we have rains almost every day. Bring light dresses suitable for summer and a rain-coat considering the regular rain.\n\nCannot wait any longer to meet you in person.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nMahmud Riad"

    "answer": "Dear Julia,\n\nIt is so good to hear from you again after such a long time. Besides, I am also very excited that you have decided to visit my country on a two-week holiday and I won't miss the opportunity to meet you during that time.\n\nWell, let me tell you what you should know before coming to my country. First of all, my country is never as cold as yours. So, you don’t really need to bring much winter clothes of yours. Besides, renting taxis in my country would be a bit too expensive for your liking, and therefore, it would be better for you to commute by public bus. Then, it would also be important for you to know that renting hotel rooms in my city would be a bit more expensive than the usual since the demand for the hotel rooms would be too high at the time you arrive because of the holiday season. So, I have decided to book your room in a nice hostel for bachelor people where the cost is reasonable. I am sure you will like the accommodation arrangement and the surrounding views.\n\nAnyway, I guess, I have given you all the necessary information for a comfortable holiday stay. But, if you need any more information, please feel free to ask anytime.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nNatasha"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI would like to draw your kind attention that, the train schedule in my area has recently been changed and due to this, many office goers like me are suffering. I am hoping you would keep the previous timetable and introduce more frequent trains for the convenience of the residents.   \n\nI am a banker and I work as an assistant manager at the City Bank. I regularly commute to my office using your train. Sadly, the train I used to take to reach office no longer stops at our station and as a result, we need to travel a few extra miles to reach the City Centre Station which is overcrowded in the morning hours. I am often late to reach my office and have objections about the revised train timetable.  \n\nWith the introduction of the new train schedule, daily commuting for employees like me has become utterly difficult which ultimately makes your service unreliable. Unfortunately, because of this problem, many commuters are late for their work which is affecting their productivity. Consequently, they are very upset about your service.\n\nAs a solution to this problem, I would recommend you to revert to the previous schedule and arrange more trains during the peak hours. If it is not possible, then at least add more carriages to increase the space. It will be a great relief if you can resolve this problem as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCampbell Scott"

The recent change to the train schedule is causing great sufferings for many commuters like me and I am hoping you would consider a revision of the timetable.\n\nI work for an IT company in Denver and several other office goers have the same schedule that I follow to reach the workplace. I used to take one of your trains at 7:40 am from Seven Hills Station and usually reached my destination around 8:30 in the morning. The Denver Station, where the train used to drop me off, is only five minutes walk from my office.\n\nHowever, under the revised timetable, your train no longer stops at my station at 7:40 am and I am forced to take a train from the Curberry Station at 8:30 am which is almost a mile away from my residence. This revised timetable and schedule are inconvenient for us. A train takes passengers from our station, but only at 6.30 in the morning and this is too early for us to get on the train. I have also checked with fellow passengers who are also struggling to get to the work on time.\n\nI request you revise the train timing again and reinstate 7:40 AM's train to stop at our station, which will enable me or fellow passengers to travel to work on time.\n\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nRavi Babu"

He is a highly revered person who is equally loved by his friends and foes.\n\nI personally believe that you should consider him for the award you are intending to present to people with their great contributions to the community. What can be more inspiring when someone's actions motivate hundreds of others to make the world a better place to live in? A simple crest or a trophy as the award would suffice, but you should make the award-giving ceremony open for all.\n\nOnce again thank you for your time and initiative.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHelena Gomez"

I have recently noticed your advertisement dated 12th April 2020 and writing this letter to recommend a person who I believe deserves the reward you intend to present.\n\nMy organisation’s director, Mrs Hemamalinee, is the person I would like to suggest for this reward. She has been working for widow women for more than three decades. She is a capable, experienced and talented woman absolutely fitting to receive this award.\n\nShe utilises her time for other needy women. Both as a director and individually, she has supported many widows and destitute women. With her dedication, support and willingness, she has become a role model in our community. She never differentiates people based on their race, religion, disability and colour. That is, she treats all equally and she is an exemplary personality for many.\n\nI would like to suggest a reward for this excellent lady; a trophy printed her name and her service to the community. This should be an award for her lifetime achievement. Many women who obtained supports through her would be utterly happy if she receives this reward. We would be highly thankful if you could nominate Mrs Hemamalinee on your list.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nNiro Renu"

I am hoping that you would take steps so that no other shopper fall victim to similar incidents.\n\nI am Shahin Shah and I live a few blocks away from your supermall.

Just after I took a shopping cart, a woman with her groceries collided with me. I cannot say that it was entirely her fault as she was over 70 years old and sufficient light was not present at that corner of the mall. In addition, the floor was slippery. So, this unavoidable accident occurred as the lack of attention by your management. Though this was a minor accident, it could have been worse!\n\nHundreds of people, including children and senior citizens go shopping to your mall every day. It is your responsibility to maintain this place to avoid such a mishap. Please arrange more electric bulbs at that corner of your shop and dry the wet floor immediately to avoid the unexpected accidents.\n\nI hope you will give immediate attention to this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nShahin Shah"

I am a lecturer at a private university and often do my shopping at your mart.\n\nIt is a matter of regret that during my last visit to your Banani branch, I found the frozen food area completely wet and slippery. I guess it might have happened due to the inactive freezing system or any kind of technical issue. Also, the lethargic housekeeping was responsible for it. Unfortunately, I slipped my footstep while passing that area since I did not have any idea in this regard. Although I had managed with a small injury, it could have been fatal. I noticed many elderly people shop at your supermarket and it is quite unacceptable to have such an area that can possibly cause harm to people.\n\nI believe, Meena Bazar authority is having the best management individuals like you and you would take proper actions after getting it notified. Therefore, in the consideration of its goodwill, you should be more attentive regarding all kind of safety issues like this. I recommend you to monitor all electronic devices more frequently with professional bodies.

I am writing to request you to publish an editorial in your newspaper regarding the problems the expansion of the local airport would cause.\n\nI live near the Bogra International Airport where more than two thousand citizens, including children and older people, reside. Living near the airport is already difficult as harsh noises are frequent, especially at night when the aeroplanes land or depart the runway. If the number of flights is increased, the noise will become unbearable. This could result in immense distress to the people. Besides, it would worsen the traffic condition of the adjacent roads.\n\nMoreover, the airport authority wants to expand the area; so our lovely park, which is essential for every citizen of this locality, will be diminished. Due to this, everyone in our locality is against this proposed development.

My home is situated on the Callos street - next to the airport, and I am hoping that you would publish an editorial to protest the development.\n\nThe residents are constantly confronted with the noise and turbulence problems, created by the flights arriving and departing the airport. This is a significant issue as a major part of our population comprises young school children. The nuisance does not allow the old people a peaceful night either. Moreover, the commotion caused by the flight sometimes results in cracks or even broken glass doors and house cabinets.\n\nNow given the situation, I believe that Miami is not among the front line airports of the country and there is a restriction imposed by the government on the number of flights operated daily. I would like to plea to the president an obstruction on this plan because an expansion of the airport will aggravate the problems in our community. An increase in the number of flights will cause more turbulence and nuisance, which is explicit. I am not against any development in our country and I believe it would be ideal if the authority could come up with an alternate approach to this issue.\n\nLast but not least, I would request your editorial section to publish a report on this moot issue.\n\nIn anticipation of favourable actions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJones Nathan"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am a regular reader of your newspaper, and I also like how you and your newspaper take bold efforts to bring out many issues into the light, which our hometown faces from time to time. And I am writing this letter to you in order to express my dissatisfaction over a local government's proposal to change the existing bus timetable.\n\nIn fact, such changes in bus schedule would severely affect me personally as well as many others like me since we will not be able to catch our buses on time in order to arrive at our work. By the way, before the schedule changes, I could catch my bus at 8:00 am, but the same bus would pass by my house at 9:00 am now. Besides, according to the new bus timetable, I and many people in my community would not be able to commute to other places in any buses since they now stop at some other bus stoppages, which are quite far away from our neighbourhood.\n\nSo, I would like to request to the local government through your newspaper not to change the bus schedule while actually improving the service by having more frequent bus services and comfortable seats.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPeter Cox"

I, along with my family, have visited your restaurant several times and would like to organise the party in your restaurant. I am hoping to get further information and a confirmation of the availability of your party hall on that day.\n\nDelicious food, ambient environment and the behaviour of your waiters were very impressive so far. So, when we were planning to organise a party, your service came to my mind first and I have decided to book it. This would be a graduation party for around 25 students and we will enjoy every bit of it. I am sure you have already arranged other graduation parties and know well about the nature of this sort of party including noise, gathering and need for quick service.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, the program will be held on 27th August. Some friends might use drinks for them and I hope you can arrange it. We need the hall room from 6:00 pm to 9:30 pm. Please inform me about your menu for dinner as well as the projected cost to serve the party at your restaurant. I also hope to get a discount as a regular customer.\n\nI will be waiting for your response.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSudip Pant"

I have recently graduated from Loyola High School and intend to book your place for a graduation party we are planning to organise. I am hoping that you would provide me with some details and help me book the hall.\n\nThe graduation party, as the name implies, is meant for the mushrooming young minds passing out of our high schools this year. As a new graduate and the organizer of the function, I need to make sure the party goes well. As of now, we are flexible with the date as per the availability of the restaurant but would insist on dates from 22nd to 25th of this month. We plan an overnight party starting from 20.00 hrs to 5.00 hrs next day.\n\nNow, I reckon it is imperative to mention that our high school is multicultural in nature and hence a streamlining on the food menu would be impossible. As the convener, I would suggest you include food items like pasta, rice, roasted chicken, burgers, mutton and sandwiches which are globally well accorded. Please note that a few vegetarians would be among us, so I would also request something special, from your end to their delight.\n\nWe will be around fifty people all together and hope to enjoy a memorable event held with high regards at your restaurant. Finally, let me know the approximate cost and availability of your establishment as early as possible.\n\nIn anticipation of a prompt reply to facilitate further.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAlfred Jones"

However, I need financial help as this course is expensive.\n\nI am hoping that you would disburse the loan so that I can take the course. I need a loan not more than $3000 and I am willing to repay the monthly instalment incurred from the loan over the next two years.\n\nI would really appreciate your consideration and a positive reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nNathan Adam"

I am willing to take a part-time Microsoft Office course at Skill Tech and hoping that you would grant me a small loan.\n\nPlease, let me take a minute to provide you with some details about me and my background. I hold a degree in Internal Auditing, and most of my works are based on computers. To date, I have conducted internal audits of many organizations ranging from small companies to large public companies. But still, I don’t have facile command in Microsoft Office as most of my previous clients used the alternative software. I came to know that your organization grants fund up to one thousand dollars to students who want to take such courses. I believe this course will greatly help me in my upcoming audit assignments and will make me stand out from the rest of my peers.\n\nMy intention in writing this letter is to ask that you consider acknowledging a self-motivated individual who could make the most of your funds. I would, therefore, request you to grand me a loan of $1000 which I am willing to repay within the next year.\n\nHoping to receive your supportive reply soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSameed Qureshi"

I am hoping that you would allow us to continue our practice at a convent time you feel suitable for a greater good.\n\nThe letter simply stated that we no longer can practise in the community hall and better look for an alternative. The scenario is, in fact, complicated than that. As a young group of musicians, we patronise the community and often perform without any royalty. We primarily focus on music and lyrics that promote the peace, protest wars and inequity in the society. A large number of followers, mostly youths, are encouraged by our work and they follow us on social media. We believe in our community and all the members of our band are sworn to work for a greater cause, not for money or fame. We often attend community welfare programmes and do voluntary social works as a team.\n\nIf we are barred from using the community hall, we will soon find it hard to keep our dream alive as we are unable to hire an expensive location for practice. The purpose of the community hall is, in fact, to foster good works and support the community members, not to discourage them.\n\nI, on behalf of my team, would like you to reconsider the decision as we believe in your vision for a better society. We can use the community hall on Friday and Saturday morning when according to my knowledge, no one uses it.\n\nThanking you in advance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAlfred Ton"

After giving a lot of thought and consideration to my current situation, I have finally decided to leave your company, effective from 1st of August 2020, and pursue another course of plan and career in future.\n\nIn fact, I want to work in the field of Horticulture. But, please know that I have learned about a lot of things after working at your company. Besides, each and every staff at your company has treated me like their family just as I have done with them. So, there is absolutely nothing wrong as far as your company and my current position are concerned.\n\nBy the way, I want to pursue my career as a Horticulturist because my family has some substantial land property and gardens which I want to look after and possibly expand them as much as I can. It is just that for the last couple of years, I have felt really strongly about working in the field and remain close to the Mother Nature instead of getting stuck in an office environment.  \n\nThank you once again for everything you have done for me. I will be always indebted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPema Lingpa"

I am hoping that you would allow me to move into your apartment at the beginning of September instead.\n\nI am Koharu Rio, signed a rental agreement with you on July 15th and I am due to move into your apartment C4 located in Cranberry Street on 1st of August. I have already paid you two months rent upfront. However, the sudden news of my mother-in-law's sickness propels us to change our plan. I along with my husband and children will travel to Japan sometime next week. I am not sure how long we will be staying there but it would not be less than a week I guess.\n\nAfter we get back from Japan, my husband and I both will be terribly busy to cover our work at our offices and hence shifting our house would be impossible for us. I would request you to consider my circumstances and allow me to move into your apartment at the beginning of September.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon regarding this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKoharu Rio"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing in regards to the evening programs which are currently being telecast on your TV channel. As per the current schedule of the evening slot, most of the programs are boring and unexciting. It would be great if you can reschedule some of these programs and introduce more exciting and absorbing programs in the evening time.\n\nMost of these programs of the evening slot are in the category of soap opera and the target audiences are mostly adult women. If this slot had more family entertainment programs like comedy, magic show, reality show, children-oriented programs, or documentaries, it would have been more captivating for audiences of all ages. I believe by introducing this variety of programs into the evening slot, your channel can attract more viewers and well as advertisers. Since audiences of a specific age group enjoy your evening programs, you must be missing some advertising opportunities.\n\nEvening time in each family is considered to be the reunion time. Children join their parents after completing a long day in school and in the same way parents also return home after a tiring day in office. So every member of the family prefers being in the living room in the evening as their meeting place and the television is their medium for relaxation and entertainment. Now if your channel can telecast my proposed list of programs, it will cover the interest of everyone in the family.\n\nI hope my request is valid and logical enough to draw your attention. Please reconsider your current evening programmes which are being broadcast.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nNilay Das"

I think that such diversities in your evening TV programs would prove out to be better since it would attract many more audiences for your TV channel while also generating more advertising revenues.\n\nI hope you will consider my suggestions and bring out some changes in your evening programs.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobinson Duke"

I would specifically like to know your refund policy for people who cannot complete the whole course.\n\nI have recently noticed your advertisement in a daily newspaper and as a passionate learner of this sport, I would like to get enrolled in this three-month-long program. As the course is intended for the intermediate players of tennis, it would be a good fit for me.\n\nHowever, there are some issues that I would like to resolve before getting into this course. Firstly, the timing of the course, according to the adverts, it is from 4:00 to 6:00 in the evening. However, I cannot join it before 5:30 pm. Is there any option to adjust the timing or date? I guess that would be necessary for learners who have a full-time job. Besides, I will probably travel to Sydney, Australia during my course schedule and would stay there for almost two months.

But, then my excitement died down a little after noticing that the short was not really that short after all.

I am writing to express my concerns in relation to the current scenario of low staff retention in our company, especially with regard to younger and relatively new recruits. I would like to share my ideas to improve the retention rate.\n\nOne of the main reason behind this high attrition rate is the lack of opportunities in terms of professional advancement, according to those who left our company during the last two years, which I think should be well taken care of. A team of experts may think of different strategies towards this, which should bring out programs to enhance skills, providing different job titles and look into the promotional aspects for young employees.\n\nAnother important reason, which one of our employees shared with me at an exit interview, is the dearth of open communication between the management and the workforce, which needs to be improved by providing them with a platform to air their concerns and suggestions, and ensuring that these are well-acted upon. Furthermore, the work-life balance of the employees may be observed closely for betterment.\n\nFinally, I would like to suggest that appreciation of work on a regular basis can also work magic.\n\nI look forward to a positive step in this direction to improve employee retention in our company.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn Desuja"

I am also doing fine except that I am really struggling to put together a plan to celebrate my parent's 40th wedding anniversary in a very special manner.\n\nFor a minute, I thought that I was going to take them to the same place where they spent their first vacation. Then, I also thought I should buy them the same kind of dresses which they wore on their wedding day. But, I finally thought that as a professional event planner, you are the best person to assist me in planning this unique event.  \n\nNot to mention, this wedding anniversary is quite special for all of us as it marks 40 years of shared love. It is unique to my parents also since, after all these years, they both have finally fulfilled their dream of buying a beautiful house in a lovely countryside where they want to spend the rest of their lives. Besides, this wedding anniversary would also allow them to show their love and appreciation for each other.\n\nSo, given how special this occasion is, please inform about a date and time when you can meet me and give me some professional advice on how to make the event memorable and exceptional.\n\nHope to see you soon. Take care.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nJenny"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI have recently completed my graduation from the Singapore University of Technology and Design and my major was Engineering Systems and Design. I am writing to get the details about the scholarship program that your university offers as I am really interested to complete my Master's degree from your university.\n\nI would like to pursue my Master's degree at the Loughborough University and I am looking forward to getting a scholarship in the faculty of Engineering System and Design. As I want to build a career in the Engineering sector, I would like to complete my Master's degree in the same faculty that I did for my graduation.\n\nI am convinced that doing the post-graduation at the Loughborough University would be an excellent decision for me as the university offers the opportunity to study a subject to an advanced level, develop personal and professional skills, and it is one of the best universities in the UK. The 440-acre single-site campus offers great facilities for students, staff and gives every student the opportunity they need to achieve their full potential. I would be very proud to be a part of this glorious university.\n\nI want to continue my Master's course in Engineering Systems and would be able to do so only if I am granted a scholarship as I come from a middle-class family. My Engineering Systems and Design graduation course had 138 credits in total and I achieve CGPA 3.89 out of 4.0. I have part-time job experience in the Engineering design field and I believe I can prove my competency for the scholarship provided that I get an opportunity.\n\nI look forward to your reply and would really appreciate your guidance regarding this.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nLee Gordon"

I have already finished my bachelor’s degree in Economics, and now I want to pursue a master’s degree in the same subject.\n\nI have already learned quite a lot about your university by reading everything on its website. Needless to say, I like everything about your university which includes very modern and well-equipped classrooms, universal curriculum, affordable hostel accommodation, and highly qualified and experienced professors and lecturers. However, what I find the most impressive about your university is its very high campus placement rate which is about 75 per cent.\n\nI know it is not easy to get a scholarship at your university, but I think that my good grades in bachelor degree (GPA 3.90 out of 4) and a high score in TOEFL (623 out of 677) would make me eligible to receive a scholarship in my subject.\n\nI look forward to hearing your response on my eligibility to receive a scholarship at your university.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nKishor Gupta"

I'm so happy that you have finally decided to migrate to Canada and I would say that it is a timely decision considering your career and children's education. As you know I have migrated to Ontario, Canada last January and we are doing fine.\n\nIt was a big decision to migrate to another country but I am delighted that we have finally settled in. It's been almost four months and we already feel like home. The different weather was perhaps the hardest part to adapt with but we are doing excellent.\n\nAs you know, Canada has one of the highest immigration rates due to better job opportunities, cultural diversity, economic strength and its tolerance to immigrants. On top of that, superior education this country offers is unparalleled. Canada’s affordable education system has contributed to its appeal to immigrants and I primarily considered my daughter's education before deciding to migrate to another country.\n\nI have managed a job in an accounting firm and the pay scale is really lucrative. We have rented a house near Ria's school and it's around 30 minutes drive away from my office.  Canadians are very nice people, especially Ontarians and I have already made a few friends.

They offer some really nice amenities but there are still scopes for improvements. I am hoping you would publish it in your newspaper so that the market authority learn about it and take initiatives to develop the area.\n\nTo start with, the Agora Community Shopping Complex is the largest shopping market in our town where several thousand people shop every day. The strictly monitored market price and the availability of the products under a single roof are two attractive aspects of this market. Moreover, I like the way the shops are arranged on each floor. Overall, I am happy with this market and visit it almost twice to thrice each month.\n\nRegrettably, most of the shoppers still do not accept international credit cards. I have seen many tourists suffer due to this. Since this is a tourists area and many foreigners visit this market, the international credit cards should be accepted by all merchants. Besides, the food court area is really compact and cannot serve many customers at a time. One has to stand in a cue for a long even for a cup of tea! This area should be extended and more food businesses should be encouraged to open new shops for the convenience of shoppers.\n\nI think your newspaper is widely read in our area and if you run a poll regarding the issues I mentioned, you will find a realistic picture of it.

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing this letter to report on a lost identification card which was issued by my university. My name is Paul Jeremy, and I am a final year post-graduate student at the University of Manchester, majoring in Finance.\n\nAs soon as I became aware that I do not have my student ID with me this morning, I immediately informed it to the university authority. But, in response, they asked me to report the incident to the local police.\n\nOf course, the local police authority would need to record some specific information about what I did yesterday or which places I visited, so I will go ahead and do just that. To begin with, yesterday, after finishing my classes, I went to Victoria Park for a while. After that, I went to the Curry Mile in order to eat some foods before going back to my home on Denmark Road.  By the way, my ID card number is BK – 4982372 and it has my picture on it.\n\nSo, based on these details above, please provide me with some necessary documents at your earliest convenience so that I can apply for another student ID.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPaul Jeremy"

I wish I could visit you and spend some quality time with you all.\n\nI have recently joined a large telecommunication company in Brisbane as a project manager and I am enjoying the job. Are you still taking the yoga classes? Do you still read books the way you did in the past? I wish I have been a passionate reader like you. Have you finished reading 'Lady Susan' by Jane Austen that you borrowed from me about a year ago? I quite enjoyed reading it and this book is special to me as my grandmother gave it to me on my 14th birthday. This book is a reminder of her who had been a loving personality and an idol in my teenage. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I did and you would not mind returning it. I consider it one of the greatest possessions of mine.\n\nI would really appreciate if you can return the book via the postal service at your convenience. If you are yet to finish it, send me after you read it.\n\nWhy don't you visit us sometime during the summer vacation? We would be glad to have you at our home.\n\nWith lots of love,\n\nElla"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am Stephen Ben, a resident of Brooklyn, New York, and I am writing regarding an article I read on 24th November that was a great read but unfortunately had some incorrect information and facts. The article was basically about professor Albert, a renowned professor at Fordham University whom I personally know.\n\nFirst of all, I must state that the article was quite interesting and it gave many insights on how research in local universities can contribute to the national interest and how Professor Albert had been a pioneer on that. I, however, was daunted to notice some blunders in the article that I deem should not have been overlooked. I have been a research assistant for Professor Albert for more than 3 years and we are still in touch.\n\nThe fact that Mr Albert is from Germany is incorrect as he is originally from the UK. He achieved his graduation from an American university, not from Australia. Moreover, he is not a father of 4 children, but three. Finally, the bio-hazard digression project that was credited solely to him was actually conducted with the assistance of another professor from the same university. He is Professor Gill and he should have been credited for the work as well.\n\nI wish a follow-up article or an editorial correction should clarify those issues as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nStephen Ben"

But, I am writing this letter to inform you that the article you wrote on Mr. Gaurav Patel, published on 25th of August, unfortunately, has some wrong information.\n\nIn that article, it was written that Mr. Gaurav became involved with some political activities after his retirement which is not true. In fact, during that time, he was merely trying to help a particular political party in organising some kind of charity works in his area to help the poor and distressed people. By the way, I can say this because I know Mr. Gaurav Patel personally for more than ten years and we both live in the same area. He is a very benevolent fundraiser and a very rich but honest industrialist.\n\nSo, as you know the truth now, please take some appropriate actions to correct the mistake either by writing a follow-up article or by publishing an editorial correction, whichever you deem fit.\n\nThanking you for your attention and consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAmit Agarwal"

I paid $270 for this product but unfortunately, this bag does not look like the one I saw on your website as far as its colour and design is concerned. In fact, the bag, I ordered online, was light yellow while the bag I have received is dark yellow. Besides, the fabric, which has been used inside the bag as an inner layer, looks to be of very poor quality. Finally, the design is not exactly the same and I wonder how could this happen!\n\nAnyway, I do not like to sound like a complaining person, trying to find faults in the bag I have purchased. So, I would highly appreciate it if you please replace this bag with a bag of better quality as well as with the colour and design that I had initially ordered for. But, if you do not have what I have been looking for, please make a full refund to me as soon as you can.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nKelly Megan"

It is a medium-size, leather made brown bag that has a large zipper on the top. It has two side pockets and the main zipper was locked. It contains a few dresses of mine, a diary, two fountain pens, a calculator, a PDA and a few important business documents. I really need my PDA and the documents for an upcoming presentation at my office.\n\nI would highly appreciate your cooperation in sending the bag to my home address which is stated at the top of the letter.

I've got a perfect place in my mind just for you and John.\n\nI'm sure you want to make your holiday trip memorable. I had been to Copenhagen, Denmark last summer and it was a great place to be. Copenhagen is a place I cherished so much. It has so much style and beauty, and a dose of good fresh air.\n\nI stayed at the Hotel Sanders, opposite the stage door of the Royal Danish Theatre. It had glamorous touches in an otherwise homely space. Their menu is celestial. The first place I visited was Rosenborg Castle- which is 400 years old and was built in the Renaissance style. The Town Hall is another magnificent place on Radhus Square where the zero kilometre stone is located.\n\nI absolutely loved a 3-hour sightseeing tour of Copenhagen by bus and boat. I recommend you do the same and see the Danish capital's famous attractions on a narrated coach tour. It would not cost you much but you will love the experience.\n\nFinally, I must mention the food I enjoyed there. With so many hot dog stands all over the city, it’s not hard to notice locals’ love for sausages. Not only they are super tasty but also a cheap solution to fill hunger while roaming around the city. One food you must enjoy is Falafel.\n\nI wish you a great trip. Take care and write me back when you are free.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nBarbara"

But, I would still suggest that you visit Cyprus since it has one of the best weather in the whole world.\n\nBy the way, I stayed in Limassol, a city on the southern coast of Cyprus, after arriving in the country. In fact, the experience of enjoying the celestial view of the entire city of Limassol at night from “Panthea Resort”, located on the hills of Limassol in the middle of all areas, is something beyond any words can describe. Besides, the chance to swim in the clear water of the beautiful Limassol beach and enjoying the fresh Cypriot food and salads will keep your mind captivated for a long, long time.\n\nWell, I think that information, I have already given you, should be enough for you to decide whether to choose Cyprus as your holiday destination or not. \n\nWishing you a pleasant tour.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nRob Standridge"

Besides, I have already talked to James and he is ready to take a few important responsibilities of mine in the meantime. Once I get back to the office, I would endeavour to come earlier than usual and work on weekends, if needed, in order to catch up on anything I had missed.\n\nI realise my temporary absence could be an inconvenience to the office but in the long run, our company will benefit from my knowledge and thesis activity which involves an empirical investigation into the impact of leadership on organisational performance. Since our company is considering a few training sessions for the team to enhance the leadership quality, my expertise could be useful.\n\nI am looking forward to receiving your approval for the leave.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDavid Ferrer"

I want to pursue a career in the financial service industry in my home country and want to take advantages of the contemporary and specialised approach to accountancy and finance that this course offers. The worlds of accountancy and finance are always changing due to the changing legal framework the financial sector operates in. This is why I have decided to enrol in this course. I plan to finish it on time and learn as much as possible.  \n\nTo assist in covering my tuition fee and get some job experience, I intend to do a part-time job, specifically in an accounting firm. Hope my Bsc in Accounting would be helpful for that. I hardly know anyone in the UK except you and I know that you have a wide social network in London that you can use to manage a job for me.

Besides, conventional wisdom suggests that whenever a person likes to do something, the chances are that he or she will become a real expert in that subject or profession, sooner rather than later.\n\nFinally, in defence of studying History, the job prospect after studying this subject is no less than studying computer science since many universities would compete among themselves to recruit you as a faculty member to teach history if you have good results.\n\nHowever, I would like you to think more as it is ultimately your future.

Actually, I need the recipe for Japanese Ramen Noodle Soup from you since I am going to throw a party soon.\n\nOf course, this is going to be a very special party since all of my high school friends are going to get together and have a good time while talking about our works and achievements in life for the first time after finishing high school.\n\nAnyway, the reason, for which, I am asking for this recipe is that I fell in love with this particular soup after eating it at one of the upscale Japanese restaurants in my country. So, I thought that it just would be a great idea to introduce this awesome and delicious dish, instead of only those food items which we enjoy on a regular basis, to all of my friends at the party, so that I could impress them with my new idea.\n\nPlease get back to me with the recipe of this awesome soup once you read this letter.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nAdam"

I was excited when I ordered these items and got your assurance that I would receive them in three days but very disappointed not to receive them yet. I am hoping that you will complete the shipment by tomorrow.\n\nIn relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased a Sony smart TV, a Samsung mobile phone, a screen protector, a memory card and a pocket router from your outlet 'Gadget and Goods' on July 18th. I paid using my Visa Credit card. The order number is 8683201 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.\n\nSince you did not have the specific model of the TV and silver colour mobile phone at your outlet, you agreed to send the items to my home address before 21st July. Unfortunately, seven days have already elapsed and neither did I receive the goods nor did I hear from you.\n\nAs a solution, and because I am a regular customer of your store, I am hoping that you will send my products by tomorrow.

I will contact my bank to reverse the credit card payment if I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a day.\n\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMichael Keaton"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nMy name is Aaron Johnson, and I have been living at one of the Trinity college hostels for almost 6 months. My room number is 241, and I share it with another student. Sadly, I am writing this letter to inform you about some of the severe problems that I have been dealing with for the last six months.\n\nFirst of all, this room is too small for 2 students. In fact, after setting there two single beds and two study tables, there is hardly any extra space left in the room. Besides, the walls of the room on all sides remain dampened most of the times, spreading some kind of bad odour, which is certainly not good for our health. In fact, because of this continuous foul odour, sometimes we cough. Finally, the attached bathroom very seldom releases hot water, and as a result, we have to take a shower in cold water which makes us sick, during the winter.\n\nTherefore, I would really appreciate it if you please transfer us to another room which is remodelled or built new and has hot water supply in its attached bathroom.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAaron Johnson"

    "answer": "Dear Wilson,\n\nIt was great to hear from you and I’m really surprised that Diana has already turned to 8. It sounds as if she has grown so fast. I wish her a happy birthday and thank you for inviting me to this special occasion.\n\nI would love to be at Diana's birthday party but I’m terribly sorry that I can not make it due to some deadlines at my office next week. The problem is that I’ve been promoted to the assistant manager position a few months ago and the work pressure has skyrocketed since then. The office management has assured me that I will be given an assistant soon but until that happens, I will hardly have time to spend for me.\n\nPerhaps I can visit you sometime next summer when I hope I will stay with you for a couple of days. Please share some birthday photos on Facebook so that I get a glimpse of the celebration. I owe Diana a birthday gift.\n\nAnyway, I must finish today. So thanks once again for your kind invitation and I do hope that we can get together sometime in the summer.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nHarris"

I can’t really believe that your daughter is already 8 years old when it actually feels like she was born only a few years ago.\n\nAnyway, as much as I would love to attend the birthday party of your lovely daughter, the truth is I can’t really do it since I have some other commitments for that evening. In fact, I will have to remain busy and occupied during that evening at my work since one of my foreign bosses is coming to audit the financial records of our office, and as a Senior Accountant, I will have to accompany him for the rest of the evening.\n\nSo, I am really sorry that I won’t be able to join you on such a joyous occasion of your family. However, I would love to visit you all a couple of days later to wish your daughter a special birthday, even though a belated one.\n\nHope to see you soon.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nBrian Andrew"

I am so excited about the upcoming holiday and looking forward to spending some great time with all of you.\n\nI have lately been to Vienna, the capital city of Austria, and had a great experience. I think this would be a wonderful destination for us to enjoy our holiday together. Viena is regarded as the City of Music because of its musical legacy and the historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, grand buildings, monuments and parks. Plenty of spectacular cultures is within easy reach in this city and I wish to be there again and witness a city revered by all.\n\nWe can enjoy the music film festival on City Hall Square, stroll and taste food in a magical surrounding, visit the Schönbrunn Zoo, the oldest zoo in the world, take a tour to the Ringstrasse by a tram, do some shopping and be in a city which is considered one of the best livable cities in the world. I had been there only for a couple of days and my experience was fabulous.\n\nI am quite positive all of us will enjoy our time in this city during our trip.

In fact, I am going to recommend a place which I have visited lately.\n\nThe name of this place is “Cyprus”.  Cyprus is known as the 'Jewel of the Mediterranean' and the legendary birthplace of Aphrodite, the ancient goddess of love and beauty. I think I would never forget about visiting this place because people are just so friendly there.\n\nBesides, the cost there is relatively much cheaper than many other European countries.  However, the best thing to do in Cyprus is to enjoy its incredible weather. The summer months there are warm and dry, and perfect for enjoying the island's many beaches. Even in winter, you'll find the weather warm, compared to most parts of Europe. Besides, Cyprus has one of the oldest histories dating as far back as 1100 BC which once hosted successive superpowers including Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians and Romans.  All in all, it is a great place to visit.\n\nI believe we will enjoy our time there and thoroughly enjoy our trip.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn D. Costa"

I'm writing to let you know that we have moved into a house in Bath, a town set in the rolling countryside of southwest England. I hope you would visit us soon.\n\nAs you know, my previous apartment was far away from my office and it was inconvenient both for me and Anna to commute a long distance daily. However, we could not shift our house considering Julie's school location. This summer I transferred her to Kingswood School in Bath and moved here soon after. Now the daily commute is no longer a cause of concern for us.\n\nWe moved into this house at the beginning of February and we really like it. A small garden at the front makes it even more beautiful. We now have enough space to park 3 cars! It has five rooms, a lawn and two large balconies. The best part is that the area is quiet and surrounded by astonishing natural beauty. After living in a flat in a busy area for nearly 8 years, a spacious house seems like a dream come true.\n\nI hope you would visit us soon as I am really looking forward to having you and Linda with us for a few days. It will be fun.\n\nHope to meet you soon.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nMitchell"

Of course, it was not an easy decision for me, given how much I loved that house because of its proximity to a beautiful lake and animal sanctuary, but I needed to move out of it because its owner wanted to renovate it and then sell it to some corporate businesspeople at a very handsome profit.\n\nOf course, the new house, which I moved in, is a great place because it is a lot more spacious than my previous house. Besides, the new house is built with some solid wood, which I really like, because it would help the house to keep at a comfortable temperature throughout the entire year.  So, it would mean that I would have to spend a lot less money on the electricity bill to maintain a comfortable temperature at my house unlike the old one. Besides, it is in a nice neighbourhood also.\n\nSo, come and visit me sometime, possibly next weekend, because I think you would also like my new house.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nPatrick"

I am writing to bring to your attention a few critical issues inflicted upon me and other commuters who use your service. I am hoping you would address these issues promptly.\n\nFirst, during the last couple of weeks, your buses are making recurring delays and this is affecting our arrival in our workplaces on time. To add more grief, a few buses do not arrive at all. A number of times, I had to wait for more than an hour and then hail a taxi to reach my office. Finally, some buses are full when they arrive and cannot take any more passenger from the Victoria Stand. This situation forces me and many other travellers to either take the congested bus and stand all the way in a miserable condition or wait for the next bus. I believe this would reduce people's trust in your service.\n\nI suggest that you add a few more transport to accommodate the passengers and manage the timetable rigidly.\n\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn Andrews"

We, the local residents, of little lake Tahoma town are dealing with some frustrating problems with our public transportation system who use your transportations almost daily.\n \nYour company has only a few public buses in the lake Tahoma town even though it has a rather sizeable population, and those few buses are just not enough to transport users to their desired locations on time. To make things even further complicated, a couple of bus drivers have become a bit too old for their jobs, and as such, they fail to appear for their duties every once in a while, leaving many residents completely clueless about how or when they would reach their destinations. This is not an ideal situation, especially, for the people who have to go to their jobs daily.\n \nTherefore, I would like to request you to get some more public buses on our roads immediately, and enough skilled and competent drivers to ensure a smooth commuting system in our town.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry Jones"

Well, I have joined a travel agency last month and the new job is exciting. In my previous job, I was working really long hours and, to be honest, the pay wasn’t great.

I am writing to let you know that I have recently changed my job and I love the new job.\n\nAs you know, I had been working for over a decade in the field of strategic planning for an after-sale automotive company. Unfortunately, my office shifted to another city last January. Afterwards, travelling to and from the office became quite tough due to the distance and notorious traffic congestion. I often had to spend more than 4 hours in the street and I had barely any time for my family. Thus, I was forced to change my job to save the daily commuting time.\n\nI took a job with another company in the same industry and so far I love my job. It has better remuneration, office environment and friendly management. I hardly need 20 minutes to reach the office. Moreover, my new duties which include managing a support team of 18 employees is more pleasant than that of the previous office.\n\nBy the way, I almost forgot, my wife would be travelling to Canada to attend a seminar and she asked me to invite you to a family party next week.

You have asked for my advice regarding the next step in you should take - either to join a college or alternatively get a job.

I believe you should not make the same mistake and instead take the opportunity to gain some valuable skills such as delegating tasks, managing time, meeting deadlines and working in a team. The job experience will enhance your decision-making and presentation skills. Moreover, it will open doors for better job opportunities in the future.\n\nI feel you should work in a large retail shop as a salesperson or perhaps join a small company that serves customers directly.

All of those documents are placed inside a blue folder with my name ‘Mike Buchanan’ written on top of it.\n\nIn particular, these documents are extremely important to me. They contain some confidential financial information about my company, a presentation and some notes that I took during the conference. Without those documents, I would be in great trouble. I need to submit a few of these papers to my company before the end of this month.\n\nI would request you to ask your staff to conduct a thorough search in the room and then hold this folder in your possession. Please give me a call at 0161-508745124578 once you have it. I will arrange someone to collect it for me or perhaps fly to London to receive it personally.\n\nThank you in advance for your kind help.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMike Buchanan"

I am hoping that you would be kind enough to send those papers to my address via the postal service.\n\nI am Lucas Foster, and I stayed in room number 434 on the sixth floor of your hotel. I am assuming that I must have left the papers in one of the drawers of your TV desk in a hurry when I needed to attend an urgent meeting with some of my clients in the City Hall.\n\nThe documents that I left at your hotel room are utterly important because they contain all the important terms and conditions, which I agreed upon with two of our new partners to form a new business relationship. The problem is, I can’t really remember about all those terms and conditions, so I need to get those documents back urgently.\n \nTherefore, I would like to request you to find those documents for me and mail them to me at your earliest convenience. Also, please do not forget to charge the mailing cost from my credit card that you already have on file.\n \nYours faithfully,\n\nLucas Foster"

I believe it would be helpful for me and I am hoping to get your permission to participate in it.\n\nIn relation to the specifics of the training, it’s a four-day intensive session for Brand Managers and will be held on 20th to 23rd November. Registration (materials and meals included) fee is $200 and needs prior booking. Some renowned speakers would conduct the training at the BlueText Seminar Hall and more than 100 Brand Managers from different national and multinational companies are expected to participate in it.\n\nSince this is a resourceful training session and would be helpful for us to expand our presence to a wider variety of digital channels, I am hoping you would exempt me from my duties for that time and consider reimbursing me for this seminar. I will get back to my normal work from 24th November.\n\nIt’s quite important to take advantage of this opportunity because expanding our digital footprint and social presence for building comprehensive user engagement is the key goal for me this year. This seminar promises to make the participants ready for this challenge. After successful completion of the training, I would be able to put together actionable steps that I can take immediately to start engaging more seriously with our users.\n\nThank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear from you soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWilliam Brockie"

This is a 3 months long part-time course that will start on 17 January, and classes will be held 3 times a week on weekdays in the evenings, from 4 pm to 7 pm.\n\nI am quite convinced that the course will not only help in enhancing my skills as a Junior Logistic Manager but will also provide me with enough clarity on more advanced logistic approaches of the 21st century. As you know, as an export-oriented company, logistics will always play an important role in delivery cost reduction and ensure the safe delivery of our products worldwide.\n\nTherefore, I would like to request you to allow me to leave early twice a week for the next 3 months to attend this training course.  Also, the fee for attending this course is quite high, so it would be great if I could get some funding from our staff training fund.\n\nYours faithfully,\n \nPhillip Ray"

I deeply appreciate your readiness to sponsor a local junior sports team or alternatively arrange two open-air concerts.\n\nNeedless to say, financial support to a children's sports team will be notably advantageous for both the team and your business. With your sponsorship, they will surely get advanced training which will develop their potential in sports and in parallel promote your brand. Perhaps, a few of them will bring glory in professional competitions in the future to make us proud as a community.\n\nOn the other hand, arranging two open-air concerts is also a great idea as people will immensely enjoy the performance and some local bands would get the chance to show their talents. It certainly will promote our culture and heritage.\n\nI am positive either of your initiatives will serve our community greatly. However, supporting the local sports team has a more eminent result than escalating the music fans by sponsoring concerts, I believe. Concerts would be temporary entertainments for the local people, but provision for the young sportsmen will be remembered for a long and would give us many occasions to celebrate and be proud of.\n\nOnce again thank you for a commendable initiative.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEdward Jenkins"

Your sponsorship for them would not only attract more sponsors in the future but also ensure that they become successful athletes in the future. Consequently, more children would be interested to be in sports.\n\nOn the other hand, if you sponsor two open-air concerts, it would excite people to enjoy the events. Besides, it would advertise your brand and set a milestone for others to arrange such engaging events. Many local bands would get an opportunity to perform and show their talent thus become known to many people.\n\nThough both initiatives would be highly appreciated by the local people, I believe paying for the concert would be a far better idea especially at a time when people are having less frequent chances to gather and enjoy together.\n\nI would like to thank you again for a great decision and your willingness to support the community.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Adamson"

They also showed their concerns that only one receptionist cannot serve them promptly and that kills their valuable time.\n\nNeedless to say, the area where visitors arrive and wait is extremely important as it represents the image of our company and gives the first impression of the organization. Taking this into consideration, it is highly important to enlarge the reception area by annexing the room next to it. Moreover, it would be a good idea to equip the place with an additional sofa set and a desk for the visitors to use.

In fact, I find children so special that I have taken a short online course on parenting so that I could relate to them in a better way.\n\nBy the way, I recently came to visit Australia from my home country at the invitation of my uncle in order to live with him for the next six months or so. And, while I am in Australia, I would also love to explore this beautiful country and learn about the lifestyles and culture of its people, in addition to taking care of your child should you choose to offer me the job.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDaria Olga"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nA couple of weeks ago, your popular international travel magazine, in its 250th edition, published an article about my hometown in an effort to provide a bit more exposure to the travel-related activities in it. Well, while I appreciate this noble effort of yours, I regret to inform you that there is a factual error in your article that requires immediate correction.\n\nIn fact, your article in question says that the migratory birds visit our town during the month of April while the correct information is that they start to visit our hometown from early February. By the way, correcting this information on your magazine is very important for the livelihood of many people in my hometown because they heavily rely on the tourist spending of the visitors who come to visit our town in order to see these migratory birds.\n\nTherefore, I would like to request you to please issue a correctional notice in your magazine’s next publication about the previous mistake so that the prospective tourists don’t get confused about the timing of the migratory birds’ visit to my hometown. Thank you for your consideration in advance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAntonio Perez"

By the way, the best thing about the course was that it comprehensively taught me about the arts of making some Italian and oriental desserts quickly and easily. Besides, I enjoyed learning about the tricks of chopping meats so nicely.\n\nAnyway, after finishing the cookery course, I used some of my cooking skills to prepare some delicious desserts for the birthday party of one of my close friends in addition to preparing some of my favourite dishes for my family. Before ending here, I would also like to request you to introduce a short course at your institute on preparing desserts by using different kinds of tropical fruits and vegetables.\n\nThank you once again for conducting such a useful course.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndre Dmitry"

It is indeed such a great achievement of yours, and I surely would like congratulate you on the occasion of such an amazing success. I also would like to thank you for sending me a copy of this book right away with your special signature on it.\n\nAnyway, I have already read your book, and I must tell you that I am truly impressed with your novel writing skills and abilities. I knew that you were passionate about writing stories, but I just didn’t think that you would be able to write a novel with such ease and effect. The narrator (the main character) of your novel was very engaging while the other characters around it were as natural and lively as they could get. The caption of the book under the picture of a beautiful and playful rabbit is very illustrative, and the plot has just about enough twists and turns to engage the readers from start to end. All in all, it is a great book.\n\nI am sure this is the first book of a series of marvellous writings that we will see in the future.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nAdam Fuller"

However, rather lately, I, like many other residents in your high-rising building, have been dealing with an issue which, I think, deserves some immediate attention from your part.\n\nThis issue, I am talking about, is related to the efficient use of our communal laundry room where people sometimes have to wait for a significant period of time to use the washers and dryers in order to do their laundries because there are not just enough laundry baskets available in the room. This problem becomes even more acute when people do not bother to empty the washing machines and dryers on time when their laundries are done.\n\nSo, based on these problems, I would really appreciate it if you purchase at least 10 extra laundry buckets so that the laundry users, waiting for their turns to do their laundries, can empty the laundry machines and keep their contents into those baskets. This will improve the situation to a great extent and reduce our waiting time significantly.\n\nHope to hear from you soon regarding this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLance Donovan"

Besides, I have also done babysitting job to help a few relatives of mine to take care of her two children after which I received some formal training on the first-hand experience in childcare. I have also finished a diploma in teaching children because I am passionate about teaching young children.\n\nIn addition to taking care of your children, I could also prepare some delicious Spanish food and delicacies on some special occasions to surprise your friends and families.\n\nI am hoping that you would offer me the job. Thank you in advance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMaria Lucy"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing this letter in response to an advertisement that you recently published on a local newspaper, seeking for job holders to come forward and talk to your students about how it feels to have a job. I think that it is quite an interesting proposition, and I would be more than happy to talk to your students.\n\nI would like to talk about the initial challenges that I faced when I started my current job as a physical instructor at a physical training college. After all, the first few weeks at a job can become really overwhelming for anybody. Besides, I would also like to talk about how I learned to keep young and restless people motivated in a tough working environment. I am sure that your students would be interested in my job since it would allow them to remain healthy, both physically and mentally, without even doing anything extra outside of their regular jobs.\n\nI am free the entire day next Friday on 27th of September, and I would be excited and happy to stand in front of your students and share my experience with them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn Young"

    "answer": "Dear Victor,\n\nHope this letter finds you in good health and spirit. I sure also would like to thank you for trusting me with such an important matter. So, here is what I have to say in response to your queries about the Pharmacy course at Monash University.\n\nI understand that you also want to pursue a bachelor degree in Pharmacy from Monash University which I attended. By the way, pharmacy is not an easy subject since it involves very complex techniques and skills of preparing and dispensing medicines or drugs, and thus saving human life also. Students attending pharmacy degrees will learn how different types of drugs affect the human body and mind and how they interact when mixed together. Of course, the good thing is that the university, you are choosing, has some of the best pharmacy syllabuses, faculty members and laboratory facilities to teach you just what you need to succeed.\n\nSo, just visit the website of the university at www.monash.edu to learn more about how to apply online, or just call the admission officer to ask him or her to send you the admission form and other necessary papers in the mail, if you want to proceed further.\n\nTake care. Se you soon.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nMitchel"

    "answer": "Dear Niro,\n\nHope you are in good health and spirit. I felt so happy to receive your letter last week. Anyway, you will be glad to know that I have bought a nice gift, actually, a wristwatch for you when I went to visit Switzerland about a couple of weeks ago.\n\nI know how you have always loved to wear a wristwatch, especially one from Europe. So I have bought one for you, which is gorgeous and classy in my taste. Housed in a beautiful platinum case, this watch has a shiny, dark silver colour strap. Besides, its crystal perfectly matches with its hour markers inside which illuminate nicely in the dark. It is made by \"Tissot\", one of the renowned watch brands in Switzerland.\n\nI chose this gift because not only it will look good on you, but also because it won’t get damaged quickly due to excessive sweating, especially, when I know how profusely you sweat during the summer. I also thought it would be a good gift from my tour for you.\n\nI think I am going to mail this watch in a courier service which should be delivered to you in the next couple of days. Please let me know whether I should courier to your home or office address.\n\nTake care and stay fine.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nMartin Craig"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing this letter in response to a recent vacancy announcement at your museum in which you have asked for people to do part-time voluntary or unpaid work. I would like to work for your museum as a volunteer, and I am hoping that you would give me the opportunity.\n\nI am interested in availing this great opportunity because I think that it would allow me to learn some great skills to have a better career in the future. Besides, it would also help me understand many important parts of my country’s history which I would probably never know otherwise.\n\nRegarding my skills, I have good computer skill, and I also know how to work well in a team environment with other people. Besides, I have also taken an art history class in high school before to help me understand and appreciate the value of artworks. On top of that, I also live close to your museum which would really make it easy for me to commute. So, if you choose to hire me for this voluntary position, I will work hard to add value to your team.\n\nI am available to work every day from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm except on Sunday, and if you decide to hire me, I can start right away.\n\nI am hoping to hear a positive response from you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJoseph Myer"

    "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nHope I did not catch you at a busy time since I am sure that you have many other important priorities at work to take care of. But, the issue, I want to raise here, is also equally important for our office staff.\n\nThe reason for which I am writing this letter is that our office does not have any cafeteria for its staff where they can go and sit to enjoy some snacks, drinks and food. Now, this would not really be much of an issue if they did not have to walk about 10-12 minutes to grab something for them when they need something to eat or drink during their short breaks and thus collectively waste many important work hours. Besides, going out like this just to get some snacks or get a cup of coffee is rather inconvenient for us, especially, when the weather condition is not favourable.\n\nTherefore, I would like to request you to set up a staff cafeteria in the large empty room at the corner of our office, which remains unused most of the time. That will make sure that our staff have at least one less issue to worry about when trying to be more productive and efficient at work.\n\nI hope you will consider the issue and arrange to set up a cafeteria soon. Thank you in advance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAndrew Jones"
